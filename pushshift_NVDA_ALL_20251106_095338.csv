2025-11-05 20:39:09,r/stocks,How possible is it that prices are being inflated by a computer?,"Longest government shutdown. Terrible CPI report. Massive layoffs, snap unavailability. Seems like the perfect storm for a crash. Lots of high earners in these fields including tech and nursing (yes nursing) are liquidating 401k's to stay afloat.

But something odd is happening - prices dont move on volume anymore, they move off frequency. Goldman in particular has been shouting some outragous predictions for TSLA and some tech stocks which is normal for goldman - when theyre desperate.

Ive seen prices sink 5% on millions of sales only to regain that price on a mere 50k in so called ""up bids""

Even though NVDA is worth 5 trillion, i highly doubt the trades which swing the market cap 200 billion+ each day are in any way indicative of its price, the whole thing seems like its propped up on stilts becouse the small trades pushing the bid up happen so frequently.

Not sure if this is even something that can be corrected or if computers are just in total control of price movement now. I think this is the same reason TSLA is propped up so high.

Shares in Palantir, which raised its annual revenue outlook Monday, fell as much as 8.1% in premarket trading as analysts pointed to the stock’s soaring valuation. Nvidia shares were also lower, slipping as much as 2.6%.

2025-11-04 08:15:50,r/stocks,There is no AI Bubble.,"I don't actually know if I agree with this. I just want you, the fine team of reddit experts, to make arguments as to why we are not in a bubble and there will come no crash. 

I have a few points of my own to add to this hypothesis, feel free to expand or destroy them.

**A**. Most of the money these large companies (i.e NVDA, Apple, Google) are mass investing are not being pulled from shareholders but there own giant cash piles, they are financially fine and really fucking cash rich, they have had these piles of cash sitting gathering dust for years. If share holders faulter, this means nothing in terms of risk to the actual companies.

**B**. I think people are both over and underestimating the effect of AI. Yes I know, brilliant take by me. But basically what I mean is   
  
\- overestimating in that AGI is not going to happen, not from LLM's, these models are just never going to reach that.   
\- underestimating in that even if AGI isn't happening, these ai's are going to be integrated as standard in someway into virtually every single business. Not taking jobs, not entirely. Some sure, but only in that the most people will be more efficient, But AI is so helpful.   
  
We will see dozens upon dozens of essentially AI consultancy/integration companies utilising or building task or sector specific AI helpers, for every industry. Even just as a tool for sorting, processing and pulling internal company information, if nothing else, it is ridiculously helpful and valuable. If you have ever worked at like a large energy company, you will know how much time is lost just sorting and digging through documentation.    
  
This I think will of course kill OpenAI, or at least dilute its market share. .    
  
  
**C**.  Donald trump is going to do everything he can to artificially keep the stock market growing if need be.

What caught my attention is the scale of commitment here. They've secured over a million square feet of manufacturing space across Arizona and Texas, with plans to invest around half a trillion dollars in US AI infrastructure over the next few years. The Arizona facility is handling chip production while Texas sites with Foxconn and Wistron will focus on supercomputer assembly. Mass production is expected to fully ramp up within the next year or so.

The timing seems strategic too. With data center capex projected to grow significantly and hyperscalers continuing their AI buildouts, having domestic production capacity could help Nvidia meet demand faster while reducing geopolitical risks.

(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp can add trillions more to its valuation after making history as the first company to ever breach a $5 trillion market capitalization, according to at least one analyst.

Loop Capital Markets on Monday raised its price target to a Street-high view of $350, up from $250. The new target represents upside of more than 70% from Nvidia’s last close of $202.49, and implies a market cap of more than $8.5 trillion. The average target is $231.

“We are entering the next ‘Golden Wave’ of Gen AI adoption and NVDA is at the front-end of another material leg of stronger-than-anticipated demand,” wrote Loop analyst Ananda Baruah.

Nvidia is about to begin a ramp of Blackwell graphic processing unit chips “that will essentially double its unit shipments the next 12-15 months while seeing the benefit of ASP expansion,” Baruah said, referring to average selling prices.",567,harold_liang,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oneluc/nvidia_can_hit_85_trillion_on_golden_wave_of_ai/,1oneluc
2025-11-03 16:21:23,r/stocks,NVDA and AMZN are in the spotlight again. Trump’s new AI chip stance might explain why,"$NVDA and $AMZN have been dominating the headlines this week, and it’s not hard to see why. Trump just said that Nvidia’s most advanced AI chips will be reserved exclusively for U.S. companies, keeping them out of China and potentially other countries. The move could reshape how AI infrastructure develops globally, and investors seem to be pricing in the implications fast.

It’s a huge statement not just for Nvidia but for any tech firm tied to cloud, AI, or chip supply chains. $AMZN, being heavily invested in AI infrastructure through AWS, could indirectly benefit from this tighter export control since U.S. cloud providers might now have a competitive edge in accessing top-tier Nvidia hardware.

As expected, NVDA’s intraday swings have been intense. While tracking its movements, I’ve also been through Bitget’s “Stock Futures Rush” event. They’re currently running a $250,000 pool in tokenized $TSLA shares for active stock futures traders. I’ve been testing out pairs like NVDAUSDT and TSLAUSDT there.. mostly to see how tokenized stock futures behave around news-driven volatility like this. Liquidity and execution have been smoother than I expected, especially considering how new this market still is.

I’m still on the fence about how far tokenized equities will go, but it’s been interesting to see crypto-native platforms trying to mirror real equity sentiment in real time. The overlap between traditional stock news (like Trump’s AI policy) and tokenized market reactions is becoming more noticeable.

Anyone else here has tried trading tokenized stock futures or sees potential in these crossover markets. Do you think restrictions like this could actually strengthen U.S.-based AI firms long-term, or will they just push China to double down on domestic chip development?",47,Super_College100,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1onek60/nvda_and_amzn_are_in_the_spotlight_again_trumps/,1onek60

2025-11-03 14:46:22,r/stocks,"Trump says China, other countries can't have Nvidia's top AI chips","Nov 2 (Reuters) - Artificial intelligence giant Nvidia's (NVDA.O), opens new tab most advanced chips will be reserved for U.S. companies and kept out of China and other countries, U.S. President Donald Trump said.
During a taped interview that aired on Sunday on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" program and in comments to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said only U.S. customers should have access to the top-end Blackwell chips offered by Nvidia, the world's most valuable company by market capitalization.

""The most advanced, we will not let anybody have them other than the United States,"" he told CBS, echoing remarks made earlier to reporters as he returned to Washington from a weekend in Florida. ""We don't give (the Blackwell) chip to other people,"" he said during the flight.
The remarks suggest Trump may impose tighter restrictions around cutting-edge American AI chips than U.S. officials previously had indicated, with China and potentially the rest of the world barred from accessing the most sophisticated semiconductors.

In July, the Trump administration released a new artificial intelligence blueprint seeking to loosen environmental rules and vastly expand AI exports to allies, in a bid to maintain the American edge over China in the critical technology.
And just last Friday, Nvidia said it would supply more than 260,000 Blackwell AI chips to South Korea and some of the country's biggest businesses, including Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)

Questions have also swirled about whether Trump would allow shipments of a scaled-down version of Blackwell chips to China since August, when he suggested he might allow such sales.
Trump told CBS he would not allow the sale of the most advanced Blackwells to Chinese companies, but he did not rule out a path for them to obtain a less capable version of the chip. ""We will let them deal with Nvidia but not in terms of the most advanced,"" he said during the ""60 Minutes"" interview.

The possibility that any version of Blackwell chips might be sold to Chinese firms has drawn criticism from China hawks in Washington, who fear the technology would supercharge China's military capabilities and accelerate its AI development.
Republican Congressman John Moolenaar, who chairs the House Select Committee on China, said such a move ""would be akin (to) giving Iran weapons-grade uranium.""

Trump had hinted he might discuss the chips with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of their summit in South Korea last week, but ultimately said the topic did not come up.
Nvidia has not sought U.S. export licenses for the Chinese market because of Beijing's stance on the company, CEO Jensen Huang said last week.
""They've made it very clear that they don't want Nvidia to be there right now,"" he said during a developers' event, adding that it needed access to China to fund U.S.-based research and development.

2025-11-03 01:49:01,r/stocks,AMD earnings risk and AI bubble,"Hello, ultimately it's unlikely that I make my decision based on reddit comments but I wanted to get my concerns out there in the ether because my head has become a hamster wheel with nobody to talk to to get an out. [I've made big gains this year, following big losses buying SMCI in 2024](https://imgur.com/a/sgTze17). I own 5 stocks but 46.33% is AMD and 41.58% is NVDA and AMD earnings are on Tuesday, I have limited time left to make changes. There's a lot of talk of AI bubble, but the hyperscalers announced yet another round of huge cap-ex increases for 2026. However, the concern seems valid as [seen in this interview](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-on-new-challeneges-in-ai-compute-is-not-the-bottleneck-but-is/articleshow/125033567.cms). 

Everyone knows there's a huge bottleneck when it comes to energy powering these data centers. If there's not enough power, then there's no point buying GPUs, especially since they quickly become outdated. However, this doesn't mean that GPU's are not needed, they would continue buying them if there was enough power. I thought about securing my gains and just transitioning to the energy sector, but those stocks seem 10x more overpriced than AMD and NVDA. How can you pick the winners that will execute correctly and compress their ratios? Simultaneously, no matter how overpriced people seem to think these stocks are, NVDA's PEG ratio is actually very reasonable. AMD is only 1/10th of the market cap of NVDA and the earnings could be a big disappointment or they could announce a huge increase in customers and sales for their new chips in 2026. 

Normally, I would be more cautious but I have made a life changing mistake in the past were I pretty much all-in'd NVDA stock in august 2022 (150k) after an announcement of china restrictions on chips as I was somewhat aware of the incoming AI tech after watching a documentary on google deepmind many years ago called ""alphago"". I sold my NVDA shares in january 2024, missing an over 10x gain on my investment if I just held because I was getting impatient after many months of the stock not moving anymore and a smaller investment I had in SMCI at the time (bought at 40$) went to 80$ in a very short time. Later on, I pretty much lost almost all of my gains from NVDA when SMCI had fraudulent earning reports. 

My expectation when buying AMD was that it would most likely reach a 800 billion to 1.2 trillion market cap in 1 to 3 years. I'm not sure if I would be making a huge mistake selling my AMD shares now where there could still be significant upside. As for NVDA, I was estimating a 6 trillion market cap before it went flat for a long time or corrected down significantly until power issues were solved. I still like AMD but it has run up so much, if they don't significantly increase guidance right away to justify these gains, a huge drop is likely to happen.

 I never liked buying indexes with stocks I don't know anything about, don't understand and don't care about. I'm thinking perhaps the best thing to do is sell all my NVDA and AMD shares completely before earnings and split it into TSM, MU, MRVL, VRT, GOOG as these stocks have lower PEG ratios",180,RainieY,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1omy2c3/amd_earnings_risk_and_ai_bubble/,1omy2c3

2025-11-01 19:26:50,r/stocks,What do you think of my risk management strategy?,"We don't know if GOOGL or PLTR or any of the other like NVDA will tank by 50% one not-so fine day. There's a stylized fact that the stock fall returns are significantly higher than stock spike returns. Idea behind my risk management technique is that stocks keep rallying because of money printing or whatever else, until a serious concern arises, which is when they tank by a big percentage, that too within a week. This a tail risk. Usually, downside tail risk is lot higher than upside tail risk.

I will take PLTR as an example. Highly overvalued and if the acceleration of growth is not sustained, the stock will tank. Suppose I have 1000 stocks. I will keep selling 10 lots of covered calls which are deep out of the money. These are weekly options I am talking about. In this case, I'd sell say $240 call options (covered calls). Usually, it just happens that the same moneyness put option would also be priced around the same value. So assuming PLTR is at $200, the puts at $160 strike (same expiry namely weekly) will usually cost the same even though this is not etched in stone.

So selling calls gets me some money, and I can buy puts with that money. All in all, I did not lose anything.

For some reason, if PLTR spikes to $300 in one week, I'd be screwed. This has certainly happened and the main hypothesis behind this strategy is that PLTR stock price would not spike that way in one week. However, stocks are known to tank to like 50% or lower in one day ... let alone a week.

Now when it comes to earnings, I buy a put, but won't sell a covered call. So if the earnings result in a big spike in stock price, I don't want to cap it using the covered call. But outside of this known event, selling covered calls, and buying puts using that money, seems to be a good way to kinda ""protect your investment"" right?

Once again, this risk management ""strategy"" will fail miserably if the stock spikes by 50% or more in one week. Maybe that's has happened in the past, but that's the call people have to make. Can that happen to this particular stock? If not, I will take a bet and use this strategy to mitigate the downside risk.

Would love to hear from you guys as to what you think.",0,Study_Queasy,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1olv4rc/what_do_you_think_of_my_risk_management_strategy/,1olv4rc
2025-11-01 18:44:26,r/NVDA_Stock,Nvidia: The Middleman at the Top,"
Thesis: Nvidia sits upstream, selling premium chips into clouds that increasingly want to sell services, not GPUs. If AI spend migrates to API-style consumption and hyperscalers scale their own silicon, Nvidia’s margin power meets gravity.

1) Clouds don’t want a tollbooth forever
AWS, Microsoft, and Google don’t just rent capacity; they want to own the unit economics. Amazon’s Trainium/Inferentia, Microsoft’s Maia/Cobalt, and Google’s TPU all exist to avoid paying a vendor tax on the most expensive line item in AI. Every percent of cost they strip out can be recycled into lower prices, stickier platforms, and fatter cloud margins. Platforms beat parts.

2) Buyers are moving up the stack
Most businesses won’t train frontier models. They’ll buy outcomes: GPTs, Claude, Bedrock endpoints, fine-tunes. When you call an API, you’re not picking a GPU—you’re picking a model and a latency/price SLA. That abstracts away CUDA’s mindshare. If the value concentrates at the model/API layer, the hardware brand becomes invisible to most spend.

3) Nvidia monetizes once; clouds monetize forever
Nvidia sells a system and books it. The hyperscalers resell that capacity in a thousand ways—per-token, per-seat, per-event, bundled into SaaS—again and again. The recurring revenue flywheel sits with the platform that owns the customer, not the box in the rack.

4) Porting friction is a wasting asset
Today, CUDA-first still wins on polish. But big model labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) have the talent to optimize for Trainium/TPU—and tools/compilers improve every quarter. As kernels and frameworks mature across backends, switching costs fall and “close-enough” performance plus better TCO wins deals.

5) Scarcity premium fades
Nvidia’s pricing power was supercharged by constraint (HBM, power, supply). As supply catches up and clouds right-size their fleets, list prices and queue-premiums normalize. When capacity is abundant, buyers negotiate—especially if they have in-house alternatives.

⸻

What changes my mind (bear risks)
	•	System performance gaps persist. If Nvidia keeps a meaningful wall-clock lead on training/inference at scale (interconnect + software), labs and clouds will still pay up.
	•	Software moat endures. If CUDA/TensorRT/NIM remain unbeatable in real enterprise deployments, the abstraction thesis weakens.
	•	On-prem flood. If regulated/sovereign workloads bypass public APIs and standardize on Nvidia for “it just works,” the middleman keeps the tollbooth.

⸻

What I’m watching next (simple scorecard)
	•	Instance mix: Do AWS/Azure/Google meaningfully shift share toward their own chips in public instance catalogs and customer case studies?
	•	API share of AI spend: More enterprise dollars to managed models vs DIY training implies less hardware pull-through.
	•	Per-token pricing curves: If tokens get cheaper fast, someone’s margin is compressing—likely upstream.
	•	Time-to-port stories: How quickly flagship models hit near-parity on non-Nvidia backends.
	•	Cloud gross margin trends: Expanding margins alongside AI growth suggest vendor economics are getting squeezed.

⸻

Bottom line

Nvidia is the king of AI parts in an industry racing to sell platforms. If AI consumption keeps abstracting toward APIs, and hyperscalers keep improving their own silicon, the edge shifts from the chip vendor to the cloud that owns the customer. That’s the pressure point in the stock: can Nvidia stretch its stack (hardware and software) fast enough to stay indispensable when most buyers never see the GPU?

Not investment advice. Do your own research.

2025-10-31 10:57:47,r/NVDA_Stock,Nvidia CEO hopes Blackwell chips can be sold in China but decision up to Trump,"Jensen Huang said on Friday he hoped the company's state-of-the-art Blackwell chips can be sold in China, although the decision needed to be made by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Speaking during his first official visit to South Korea in more than a decade, a day after Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping held talks there, Huang said he was delighted by the success of the meeting, but was not aware what they spoke about.

  
After the talks on Thursday, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that semiconductors had been discussed and China was ""going to be talking to Nvidia and others about taking chips"", but added, ""We're not talking about the Blackwell.""

The extent of China's access to Nvidia's chips has been a key point of friction with the United States.

Washington levies export controls on sales of Nvidia's most advanced AI chips to China, seeking to limit its tech progress, particularly in applications that could help its military.

Huang has tried to persuade the Trump administration to loosen the controls, saying Chinese AI's dependence on U.S. hardware was good for America.",104,Kitty_Katzchen,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/nvidia-ceo-hopes-blackwell-chips-can-be-sold-china-decision-up-trump-2025-10-31/,1okqeg8

That said, I can't help but think at this point and especially looking at the fundamentals that this is substantially overpriced. My thought is to sell 25%, lock in profits, and I can of course buy more assuming there is a massive correction, which I think there will be. 

Flip side is, I have at least 16 years and selling at this low of a price could be leaving money on the table.

2025-10-29 17:47:22,r/NVDA_Stock,The $500B revenue projection from GTC is getting overlooked,"Just watched the GTC keynote from DC and honestly I think the market's still processing what Jensen actually said. The company's expecting around $500 billion in revenue from Blackwell and Rubin chips combined through 2026. That's not a typo. Half a trillion dollars in chip sales over the next couple years.

What really got me though was the partnership announcements. The Uber deal for autonomous vehicles, the billion dollar Nokia investment for 6G infrastructure, major collaborations with CrowdStrike and Palantir. These aren't just tech partnerships, they're validation that NVIDIA's becoming the backbone of basically every major tech transformation happening right now. When you've got everyone from automakers to telecom companies to defense contractors all betting their future on your platforms, that's a different level of moat.

Stock's already pushed past $200 but honestly with margins above 75% and this kind of demand visibility, I'm not sure we've seen the full reaction yet.

2025-10-22 21:09:57,r/stocks,Everyone’s chasing NVDA，but Google just dropped the biggest AI news of the year,"So this one really caught my eye today.

Google says it’s developed a new quantum algorithm called “Quantum Echoes” that apparently runs 13,000 times faster on their quantum chip than the most advanced classical algorithms on a supercomputer.

It’s not just some “look how cool our tech is” moment either.

They’re saying it could help map molecular structures for drug discovery and design new materials ，which, if true, would make this one of the first real-world quantum computing applications we’ve seen so far.

I still remember when they announced the “Willow” chip last year, claiming it solved a key qubit issue. This feels like a continuation of that storyline ，one step closer to commercial use.

Now, obviously, it’s still early and there’s always a ton of hype around quantum anything, but it does make me wonder how this might eventually tie into AI. If quantum chips start boosting AI processing down the line, that could shake up the entire tech stack ，maybe even how we value GOOG compared to NVDA and MSFT.

For now, I’m just watching how the market reacts.

Google’s been lagging behind the flashy AI names lately, but news like this could quietly shift sentiment over the next few weeks.

2025-10-16 19:37:05,r/NVDA_Stock,Discussion on AMD vs Nvidia,"Just up front I am fully invested in Nvidia, I have zero allocation in AMD.

These past few weeks I have been contemplating the risk associated with holding Nvidia. At first from an ""AI bubble"" but now mostly from competition from AMD.

The AI bubble argument I have debunked for the most part in my mind.

Competition from AMD on the other hand I am trying to understand.

From what I can see are the following facts:

1. Nvidia has a massive lead over everyone in the market in raw technology performance.
2. They have a moat with CUDA and this is the de facto industry standard.
3. The have a strong lead in vertical integration and rack/data center level interconnection.
4. They are moving into new markets which could offset any margin/market share loss they experience in the data center markets.
5. The company is laser focused on one thing: accelerated compute.

The last point is what motivated this post. If you listen to the two CEOs, you notice the difference. AMD is a business, a standard foundry, making moves to enter a market and take share from the incumbent. Lisa Su discusses the market, the products, the deals, the performance specs, as any typical business leader would.

Nvidia is different. Jensen always, always, discusses the core mission of the company which is accelerated compute. He talks about creating new markets by recognizing problems and creating value by bringing solutions to potential customers. He discusses customer problems and how that will influence the new markets, how Nvidia will be interwoven.

Maybe he is just better at story telling but to me the way he speaks indicates their culture is more one of innovation, first principles thinking, vision and the future.

I am fully open to discussion about why AMD should or should not be a concern. I am considering selling off some of my higher cost basis NVDA lots to allocate some to AMD. This would hedge against potential market share loss by providing me upside exposure in AMD.

I know this is an Nvidia stock forum but hoping you guys can be somewhat objective here.

Ultimate objective is to make money, not for one company or another to win. And to enjoy the future the industry is bringing.",38,typeIIcivilization,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1o8cqe9/discussion_on_amd_vs_nvidia/,1o8cqe9

2025-10-15 21:49:43,r/NVDA_Stock,Generative AI and Firm Productivity: Field Experiments in Online Retail,"with all the FUD around an AI bubble thought people would appreciate one of the first randomized studies done on the revenue impact of GenAI.

  
""We quantify the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) on firm productivity through a series of large-scale randomized field experiments involving millions of users and products at a leading cross-border online retail platform. Over six months in 2023-2024, GenAIbased enhancements were integrated into seven consumer-facing business workflows. **We find that GenAI adoption significantly increases sales, with treatment effects ranging from 0% to 16.3%, depending on GenAI’s marginal contribution relative to existing firm practices.** Because inputs and prices were held constant across experimental arms, these gains map directly into total factor productivity improvements. Across the four GenAI applications with positive effects, the implied annual incremental value is approximately $5 per consumer—an economically meaningful impact given the retailer’s scale and the early stage of GenAI adoption. The primary mechanism operates through higher conversion rates, consistent with GenAI reducing frictions in the marketplace and improving consumer experience. We also document substantial heterogeneity: smaller and newer sellers, as well as less experienced consumers, exhibit disproportionately larger gains. Our findings provide novel, large-scale causal evidence on the productivity effects of GenAI in online retail, highlighting both its immediate value and broader potential.

Back in October he called demand ""insane"" and now the supply for the next 12 months is completely sold out according to Morgan Stanley analysts. What's notable is that demand is actually accelerating rather than plateauing, with major players like OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, and Google all competing to secure as many chips as possible.

The shift the CEO described from basic AI question answering to complex reasoning capabilities is driving much higher compute requirements than initially anticipated. This isn't just about incremental growth anymore, it's fundamentally changing data center infrastructure planning across the industry. The fact that Nvidia's CFO used the word ""staggering"" to describe current demand levels suggests we might be looking at several more quarters where supply simply can't keep pace with orders.",78,FeelingWatercress871,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1o7dgax/blackwell_demand_exceeding_expectations_as_ceo/,1o7dgax

2025-10-14 21:32:55,r/stocks,Nvidia’s Strength in the AI Market,"Nvidia remains a central player in the AI space, holding strong investor confidence even as talk of an AI bubble continues. The company’s leadership, including CEO Jen Hsun Huang, has recently made insider sales, yet this hasn’t shaken the positive market sentiment. Analysts continue to see Nvidia as a key growth driver in the ongoing AI expansion, backed by its strong fundamentals and global reach.

Revenue growth has begun to normalize after an explosive run, slowing from 86.17% in Q1 FY2026 to 71.55% in Q2. This adjustment reflects a maturing growth phase rather than weakness, as Nvidia consolidates its gains in the high-performance computing and AI sectors. Valuation metrics, however, tell a story of sustained optimism as its P/E ratio climbed to 48.89x in Q2 from 35.28x in Q1, while EV/EBITDA rose to 41.39x, showing that investors remain willing to pay a premium for exposure to Nvidia’s earnings potential. Even the stock futures rush event for traders trading major stocks on bitget for the $300,000 tokenized NVDA shares is adding more liquidity.

Strategically, the company continues to expand its footprint through key partnerships like its collaboration with CoreWeave, strengthening its position in AI cloud computing. Margins remain healthy, with gross margin at 69.85% and operating margin steady at 58.09%, pointing to disciplined cost control. Despite regulatory scrutiny and rising competition, analysts maintain a bullish outlook, believing Nvidia’s technological leadership and strategic execution will sustain its dominance in the evolving AI landscape.",0,RadiantLife3731,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o6pa3g/nvidias_strength_in_the_ai_market/,1o6pa3g

2025-10-12 19:02:04,r/stocks,Yahoo Finance says no AI Bubble,"This is from Brian Sozzi, Executive Editor at Yahoo Finance:

Can we stop with all this AI bubble talk, please?

I get it.

Those hunting for a dot-com style stock market explosion want to make names for themselves by predicting a bubble. Who doesn't want the fame and fortune associated with being right in a big way?

Who doesn't want to spend a month reporting on stocks going down 75% because of a freak warning out of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)?

Entire years could be made for content platforms in a week if the stock market were to get blown up because of a Lehman-like meltdown in tech valuations. If you are over the age of 40, you remember the trading screens during the height of the great financial crisis. Massive declines, a full-on sea of red. Every. Single. Day.

But I'm here to say we have to give these AI bubble predictions a rest. Ditto the predictions that we are in a tech bubble. It's just not what's happening out there yet.

First of all, AI is a real technology being deployed in real ways inside of Corporate America.

Second, this technology is requiring more physical assets in the ground, which are being built to support AI's real-world application. What Zach Dell (son of Michael Dell) is working on at startup Base Power (which just raised $1 billion) impressed me this week. It's addressing a key issue: power availability and costs in part because of rising stress on the grid due to AI development.

Next, the spending on AI infrastructure doesn't strike me as reckless.

I talk to CFOs and they walk me through their thinking, which seems logical. They aren't foaming at the mouth with wild-eyed predictions of grandeur similar to the late '90s.

Plus, the tech giants making the biggest AI investments are fueling their ambitions with cash on hand; not loading up balance sheets with debt. The upstarts in AI are well funded, not being 100% stupid in their organizational build-outs. They're working on tangible technology that has actual orders behind it.

""I would say that's probably thinking too small,"" AMD (AMD) CEO Lisa Su told me about concerns of AI overspending this week. ""You have to really look at what the power of this technology can do for the world.""

AMD is ""investing at the right pace because we want to accelerate ... this is a place where [and] when companies and partners make bold moves, it will be rewarded.""

Who am I to argue with Su, who may go down as one of the best tech CEOs of all time? What she has done at AMD since joining in 2012 is mind-blowing.

Lastly, let's talk about AI worrywarts' warning calls about valuations.

According to new research out of Goldman Sachs this week, the median forward P/E ratio across the ""Magnificent Seven"" is 27 times, or 26 times if excluding Tesla (TSLA), which has a much higher multiple than the other companies. This is roughly half the equivalent valuation of the biggest seven companies in the late 1990s, and the dominant companies in Japan (mostly banks) traded at higher valuations still.

What's more, the current enterprise-to-sales ratios are also much lower than those of the dominant companies in the late 1990s.

""So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,"" said Goldman Sachs strategist Peter Oppenheimer.

2025-10-11 08:42:50,r/stocks,NVDA to the moon,"A lot of people have been talking about how NVDA is going to hit a wall and decline with respect to revenue from new installs but I'm here to say why that argument is wrong.

They're saying its like the fiber companies of the dot com era.

But for two reasons it's not. 1. not ""dark fibre"" comparison. The chips are fully utilized. 2. The difference in useful life. A GPU rack is 4-6 years, fibre optic cable is 25-40 years.

This idea started when I was listening to this podcast today [https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hnnZDCH68aR1UpNW5jX1U?si=25be1aa6fa7c4626](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hnnZDCH68aR1UpNW5jX1U?si=25be1aa6fa7c4626) where at about the 1hr mark they're talking about the CAPEX/OPEX of data centres.

Someone points out and Chamath agrees that the chip failure rate is between 9%-20% in these GPU racks which is insanely high! I also think I remember Dylan Patel saying something similar on a a16z episode.

From those two data points alone [I](https://pocket-quant.com/dashboard?share=0199d1fe-157a-7383-b4bd-45b8fba4e38d) extrapolated that NVDA might be sitting on somewhere between $27B per year and $60B/year in basically recurring revenues from the need to replace failed racks

Once you add in a 4-6 year replacement cadence for the rest of the chips you're looking at anywhere from $90 BILLION to $140 BILLION a year in recurring revenue from scheduled replacements and failures. This is not including future buildout.

  
This isn't just going to act as a floor to their revenues for years if not decades to come. It is their ENTIRE current revenue. They're looking at a massive and durable business just like INTC, hopefully they don't drop the bag like INTC once they're in pole position.

Also according to this deep research report the average chip cycle is 10 years long and we're in year 3ish [https://g.co/gemini/share/436be1c0c143](https://g.co/gemini/share/436be1c0c143)

However, for some tickers in my portfolio that are lower conviction, I have stop losses set. Many nearly got tripped today, and are right on the edge for whatever happens next week. For example I have some $INTC with a stop loss set at $35.11, just below a support level (~$36.40) that has stood intact for the past week.

Using $INTC as an example, would one remove a stop loss all together? Drop it to a lower S/R level (perhaps $24.5 before the big gap up on Sept 18)?

2025-10-08 22:43:18,r/NVDA_Stock,"When AMD is willing to give up 10% of its company to OpenAI, it signals a Hail Mary attempt to rescue its business.","# 💥 AMD’s Stock Surge: Speculation Outrunning Execution

Wall Street’s recent enthusiasm for AMD — pushing the stock up over 11% to $235.56 — appears driven more by AI hype than by grounded operational readiness. The announcement of a partnership with OpenAI has triggered a wave of speculative buying, but beneath the surface, AMD faces critical execution risks that investors are glossing over.

# 🧠 Software Lock-In: CUDA Isn’t Just a Preference — It’s Infrastructure

OpenAI’s entire model stack is deeply embedded in NVIDIA’s CUDA ecosystem. Transitioning to AMD’s ROCm platform would require extensive engineering effort, retraining, and validation. This isn’t a simple swap — it’s a full-stack migration with real performance and reliability risks. ROCm has made progress, but it still lacks the maturity, developer tooling, and ecosystem depth that CUDA offers.

# 🏭 Fabless Constraints: AMD Doesn’t Own the Means of Production

AMD is a fabless chip designer, reliant on TSMC and Samsung for advanced node manufacturing. With TSMC’s 5nm and 3nm capacity already dominated by Apple, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm, AMD must compete for wafer starts, packaging slots, and HBM inventory. Without guaranteed priority access, AMD’s ability to deliver MI300X accelerators at scale is speculative — and vulnerable to delays.

# 📉 Performance vs. Promise: MI300X Needs to Prove Itself

While AMD’s MI300X accelerators look strong on paper, real-world benchmarks often reveal a gap between theoretical specs and actual throughput. AMD’s scale-out performance — especially in multi-GPU training — lags behind NVIDIA’s vertically integrated stack, which includes NVLink, InfiniBand, and optimized software libraries.

# 🚧 Supply Chain Bottlenecks: From HBM to CoWoS

Even if AMD wins OpenAI’s business, fulfilling it requires navigating a complex supply chain. High-bandwidth memory, advanced packaging, and system integration are all constrained. A single disruption — whether in HBM supply or packaging throughput — could derail deployment timelines and damage credibility.

# ⚠️ Bottom Line

AMD’s rally may reflect investor excitement, but it doesn’t yet reflect execution certainty. The OpenAI partnership is promising, but it’s also fraught with technical, logistical, and strategic risks. Until AMD proves it can deliver at hyperscale — with stable software, reliable supply, and validated performance — this pump may be more froth than fundamentals.",0,Ambitious_Ad_9893,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nzfqyg/openai_amd_announce_massive_computing_deal/nihhyo9/,1o1msbt

One table (Exhibits 7) shows the current “Magnificent 7” (AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, TSLA) trading around **23× forward P/E**, while the 2000 tech leaders were at **52×**. 

Another table (Exhibits 8) points out they’re way more profitable and have cleaner balance sheets (ROE about 44% vs 28% back then, and most of them sit on net cash).

2025-10-08 02:15:08,r/stocks,AMD and OpenAI - A raw deal for AMD,"So, we've had a little time to digest this deal, what's it all about? 

Lisa Su, in her infinite wisdom, [has granted OpenAI warrants](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000002488/000119312525230895/d28189d8k.htm) to purchase up to 10% of AMD stock. The purchase price? One penny per share. Can you buy AMD stock at that price? I don't think you can. So why exactly is Sam Altman, hereafter referred to as Sammy, allowed to buy at this price? Read on.

Sammy is granted tranches of warrants to purchase AMD stock for one penny, subject to vesting standards. According to what has been disclosed so far, the first tranche vests after delivery of one gigawatt of GPUs. So Sammy has to buy this first batch before it gets any stock. But don't worry, Lisa has confidence Sammy will have the money to buy them (courtesy of Jensen et al.). Vesting of the remaining tranches of warrants are ""further subject to achievement of specified Company stock price targets that escalate to $600 per share for the final tranche and stock performance thresholds"". 

So what's going on here? This looks like a vendor financing arrangement, not unlike NVDA's recently announced gift of cash to Sammy. Except instead of funding the gift to Sammy with cash, which Lisa doesn't have, she's funding it with stock, i.e. dilution of AMD shareholders. For the uninitiated, you are paying for this. So, Sammy gets free stock, which he's free to sell at any time. He doesn't make any money and he needs enormous amounts of cash to fund his chip purchases, so what would he do with this stock? Probably sell it yeah? And what on earth would he do with the money from the stock sales? I dunno, buy the AMD chips he promised to buy maybe? Who then paid for these chips that Sammy now has in his possession? If you're an AMD shareholder, you did, and you probably didn't benefit because you got diluted for it. Okay well how much money are we talking here? Sammy has warrants for 160 million of AMD stock, the final tranche vests at $600. Why that number, what's the significance? Hmmmm... let me see..... carry the two... square root of four.... does Pi get involved here? No, I don't think Pi is needed.... oh yeah, it's about $100 billion, the same number Jensen just gave Sammy.

Why is Lisa doing this? Why is Lisa telling her shareholders they should be giving their money to Sammy? I suppose the (not very) plausible explanation is that it gives AMD street cred. If Sammy can run his workloads on AMD chips then that's great right? Other companies will surely see that AMD is competitive with NVDA and buy AMD chips without special, zero cost, financing arrangements. To the moon! Maybe. The more retail investors bid up AMD stock, the more tranches of warrants will vest and the more they themselves will fund Sammy's chips. And I'll remind you, you've already done that, yesterday and today. Sammy basically loses nothing here. You, as a shareholder, are buying his chips and you don't even get an equity stake for it. 

Now, Jensen did something very similar, and he has cash so he has a bit more bargaining power. He at least gets an equity stake for that $100 billion of your money. And maybe you're fine with that, who knows. And what's that stake worth? Whatever you can dream up. Maybe zero, maybe 6 quadrillion, or anywhere in between.

So, that's the deal. All of these circular financing deals get confusing don't they? Who ends up footing the bill for Lisa and Jensen's exploits? Could it possibly be... you as a shareholder? Certainly looks that way.",73,MrRikleman,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o0vuae/amd_and_openai_a_raw_deal_for_amd/,1o0vuae
2025-10-07 21:59:29,r/NVDA_Stock,Forbes Article: Nvidia Stock 2x To $350?,"
Nvidia Stock 2x To $350?

Will Nvidia stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) reach $350 in the upcoming years? This likelihood is more than mere speculation. In the last six months alone, Nvidia’s share price has almost doubled, soaring from around $94 per share to nearly $185. At first sight, trading at approximately 42x consensus adjusted FY’26 earnings and 62x for FY’25, the stock may seem expensive. However, considering Nvidia's remarkable earnings growth (with EPS anticipated to increase by nearly 50% this year), its leading role in accelerated computing, and the substantial potential for AI adoption, the valuation begins to appear more justifiable. CEO Jensen Huang foresees that spending on AI infrastructure could rise to $4 trillion by the decade's conclusion, and if artificial general intelligence (AGI) materializes even partially, the need for high-performance computing could soar. Below, we illustrate a possible path indicating how Nvidia’s revenue, profitability, and valuation multiples could elevate its stock to over $350 per share, nearing a $10 trillion market cap.

Nvidia’s revenues have nearly doubled over the past 12 months, while achieving an average annual growth rate of about 69% over the previous three years, and this momentum could persist. If Nvidia increases its sales at an average annual rate of approximately 60% for the next two years and around 45% in the third year—its revenues could rise from about $131 billion in FY’25 to roughly $486 billion by FY’28, or nearly 3.7x.

Several trends could continue to fuel Nvidia’s growth. While the initial AI models implemented by companies like OpenAI in 2022 were mainly text-based, AI is increasingly evolving to be multimodal—handling speech, images, video, and even 3D—which necessitates greater computing power and a higher quantity of GPU shipments. Activity in AI deal-making shows no signs of deceleration. In the past three months, Nvidia has completed some of its most significant AI-related agreements, including a $100 billion investment and partnership with OpenAI, covering the provision of advanced AI chips and an equity stake, a $6.3 billion cloud capacity agreement with CoreWeave, and Microsoft’s $19.4 billion contract with Nebius, which secures access to nearly 100,000 of Nvidia’s latest GPU chips to boost its AI capabilities.

The next significant tech revolution could be AGI—Artificial General Intelligence—and Nvidia is positioned at the core of it. Though the timeline is uncertain, the objective is to enable AI to reason, plan, and learn new tasks without requiring retraining. Artificial General Intelligence could conduct scientific research, generate innovative insights, or design complete products independently. This potential could unlock breakthroughs and innovations across various industries, with some models suggesting that AGI could elevate global GDP growth from low single-digit percentages to over 20% annually. [1] As the world approaches AGI, Nvidia stands to gain significantly. AGI will require immense computing power to train and operate, far exceeding current AI models, and Nvidia’s GPUs are the gold standard for these high-performance functions.

Combining this robust revenue growth with the fact that Nvidia’s margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, expressed as a percentage of revenues) are on an upward trend—they increased from approximately 25% in FY’19 to around 51% in FY’25 as the company benefited from enhanced economies of scale and a more favorable product mix biased toward complex data center products. Software-related sales are also on the rise. We can assume that margins will remain stable at current levels since Nvidia's introduction of pricier high-end products, such as the latest Blackwell chips, is offset by potentially increased costs and competition in the low-end market from competitors like AMD. With margins staying steady and revenue increasing 3.7x, we could witness earnings rise 3.7x.

If earnings increase by 3.7x, the PE multiple will decline by 3.7x to approximately 18x, assuming the stock price remains constant. But that’s precisely what Nvidia investors are betting will not occur. If earnings grow 3.7x over the next few years, instead of the trailing PE decreasing from around 62x currently to roughly 18x, a situation where the PE metric remains around 32x appears quite probable. For context, Apple—a company experiencing low single-digit growth—trades at 30x. This scenario could mean Nvidia's stock could grow by approximately 1.9x within the next three years or so, a tangible possibility, leading to a share price exceeding $350. What about the timeline for this high-return scenario? In practice, it won’t significantly matter whether it takes three years or four, as long as Nvidia continues on this revenue growth trajectory, coupled with margins holding steady, the stock price could respond accordingly",58,AppropriateGoat7039,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1o0pgws/forbes_article_nvidia_stock_2x_to_350/,1o0pgws

First it was MSFT and NVDA, then ORCL, PSTG, AVGO and now AMD.   AMD is giving OpenAI a warrant to get a 10% piece of AMD, and today’s 30% jump in market value easily covered that giveaway to OpenAI.  Who’s next? Or is this trade done?  

I’ve got my eye on MRVL, SMCI, TSMC in the chip space, LUMN at the edge/connectivity layer, and maybe PANW with security.   I think ARM didn’t get enough juice from the announcement that they were part of the initial AI pact between ORCL-OpenAI-ARM-SoftBank, but a one-on-one deal between ARM and OpenAI would deliver a big uplift to ARM.

2025-09-29 18:05:17,r/stocks,WeRide (WRD) - Bet on Robotaxis - DD,"If you are looking to invest in a pure-play robotaxi/autonomous driving tech stock with blockbuster revenue growth and major global partnerships, you should seriously consider going all in on WRD. The recent quarter’s results and newsflow have been very positive: 

WRD tripled its Abu Dhabi robotaxi fleet, launched Saudi’s first service, secured permits in Dubai, Singapore, Belgium, and even made Fortune’s Change-the-World list. Some key facts:

# Let's see the recent Analyst sentiments:

* Citigroup (Sep 29, 2025): Initiated WRD coverage with a **Buy** rating and $15.50 price target.
* UBS (Aug 4, 2025): Initiated coverage with a **Buy** and $12.00 target.
* JPM: Initiated coverage orginally at \~$23 earlier this year but move it down to about 13 (still 30% upside from today
* s price)
* Consensus: Average 12-month price target \~$16.32, implying \~88% upside over current levels.

# Recent Earnings &amp; Growth (Q2 2025)

* Revenue: RMB127.2M (US$17.8M) in Q2’25, **+60.8% YoY**.
* Robotaxi revenue: RMB45.9M (US$6.4M), **+837% YoY**, now **36.1% of total revenue**.
* Gross Profit: RMB35.7M (US$5.0M), **+40.6% YoY**, with gross margin **28.1%**.
* R&amp;D/OpEx: Rapidly expanding (Q2 op-exp +42.5% to RMB487.8M) as WeRide scales globally.
* Net loss: RMB406.4M; management views spend as investment in future profitability.
* CEO/CFO: Emphasized robotaxi growth is now *core* to revenues; operations scaling globally is “at an inflection point” toward profitability.

# Robotaxi &amp; AV Partnerships (Tech Exposure)

WeRide’s whole thesis is scaling Level-4 autonomous taxis/shuttles worldwide, with major partnerships and pilots on 4 continents:

* **Middle East (Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, Dubai)**: Largest public AV fleets outside the US/China. Tripled Abu Dhabi fleet, first Saudi L4 taxi permit, rides linked with Uber. Middle East fleet aims for 1,000 vehicles by 2030.
* **China (Shanghai)**: Launched L4 robotaxis with Chery Group and Jinjiang taxi firm; co-developed new EV “CER” model.
* **Southeast Asia (Singapore)**: Grab invested in WeRide; first fully driverless robotaxi service planned with thousands of AVs in SEA.
* **Europe (France, Belgium)**: Partnered with Renault for L4 robo-shuttles, pilot programs in Belgium and France.
* **Tech**: HPC 3.0 computing unit cuts AV compute cost \~50%, giving WeRide an edge.
* **Permits**: Holds L4 AV licenses in 7 markets (China, UAE, Singapore, France, Saudi, Belgium, US), more than any peer.

# Key Metrics &amp; Valuation

* Market Cap: \~$2.9B.
* FY2024 Revenue: \~$50.2M; 2Q’25 alone $17.8M.
* Ownership: Founders hold \~4.8% each; corporate backers include SoftBank/Alliance Ventures and Zhengzhou Yutong. Top 25 holders own \~44%.
* Profitability: Unprofitable (2Q’25 net loss \~RMB406M), EPS deeply negative. Cash burn focused on R&amp;D and expansion.
* Guidance: Ambition to scale to “thousands” of robo-vehicles by 2026.
* Analyst Outlook: Average 12-month price target \~$16.3, reflecting strong confidence in growth.

# Recent News &amp; Catalysts

* **Belgium L4 Permit**: First-ever Belgian Level-4 test license for EZ10 Robobus in Leuven.
* **Dubai License**: Robotaxi trial permit; initial 50 GXR robotaxis, scaling to \~1,000 vehicles.
* **Grab Investment**: Strategic equity investment; L4 robotaxis to deploy across Southeast Asia.
* **Index &amp; PR Wins**: Added to Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index; featured on Fortune’s 2025 Change the World list.
* **Saudi Launch**: First public robotaxi pilot in Riyadh with Uber.

**What to watch next:**

* Revenue growth in Robotaxi business.
* New regulatory permits
* Partnerships with the big guys (Uber, NVDA)
* Buybacks

**Bottom line:** While there are valuation concerns due to high multiples, WeRide is unprofitable **but** growing explosively. The Q2 beat, positive analyst coverage, and pipeline of high-profile deployments make a bullish thesis. With a \~$2.9B market cap and small revenue base, the unique global footprint – 30+ cities, dozens of AV permits, and strong industry backing, I see massive growth potential. Catalysts like EU/ME rollouts, index inclusion, and continued robotaxi scaling could drive the stock if execution stays on track.",17,MirageMantra,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntm28y/weride_wrd_bet_on_robotaxis_dd/,1ntm28y

2025-09-28 15:17:00,r/stocks,Wash Sales are Confusing,"Wash sales are a conundrum.
Wash sales are an oxymoron.
Wash sales are a black hole.
Wash sales are damnable. 

Let me explain. I’m considered the pattern day trader by my broker, interactive brokers. I am not one of those day traders that has five screens constantly trading five stocks at a time. I am a day trader that quite often just trade off my cell phone and I usually concentrate on one stock. Most recently it has been NVDA. I can assure you I’m not getting rich, there is no yacht in my future. I have no problem selling the stock for a total of five dollars profit. My goal is not to get rich,  just to give me something to do since I’ve retired. I recently ran across something that I have never seen nor did I know it was occurring. And that is an aspect of wash sales that I did not know was happening. Believe me when I tell you I understand wash sales since Scott trade shut down my trading for three days one time.

I have recently started trading a new stock and in seven days and over 50 trades I only had one loss- that  of a single  dollar. I have made a little  money off this stock. So I was surprised when interactive brokers raised my average price per share on a subsequent purchase  since I have incurred so little losses (a total of -$1 over 50 trades).

For those of you, like me who thought wash sale (or losses) were based on the total trade and not each individual trade you are wrong. It is enlightening. Let’s look at an example. 

The ABC corporation pays a good dividend and the stock price is pretty much range bound at $90 a share. But a rumor has surfaced that the ABC corporation will win a big contract and the share price goes up to $100 a share, you thinking if it’s true it will go higher so you buy one share at $100. Turns out the rumor is false and the share price drops to $80 a share. You knowing it is a $90 share company buy one share at $80. You now hold two shares with an average price of $90 a share. You sell your two shares at $91 per share and pocket two dollars. The price then drops to $70 a share. You realize this is just an over reaction to the loss of a potential contract and you buy one share at $70. But interactive brokers will reflect your average price per that one share at not $70 but at $79.  Because what I didn’t know was when I sold it at $91, I incurred a wash sale from where I purchased it from $100 and sold it at $91. I always thought the wash sale was based on the total sale and not each individual purchase. So when I sell my one share at $90 that I purchased at $70 interactive brokers will reflect a profit of $11 ($90-$79). But this is a mirage.  It is an illusion. If you go check your realized gains interactive brokers will reflect a profit of $11. YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN WILL ALSO REFLECT A PROFIT OF $11. This is for tax purposes only. If you go look at your cash report, according to interactive brokers, it will reflect a gain of $20. So those of you who are basing their profits off of a realized gain report it is not a true reflection of your actual trading.",0,PaulTroon2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nso3q8/wash_sales_are_confusing/,1nso3q8

""Post our callback with NVDA’s CFO regarding the OpenAI deal, we came away with further confidence that NVDA remains the AI ecosystem play of choice and that Street estimates are too low – Reiterate NVDA as a top pick. Key takes from the callback: NVDA is the preferred supplier to OpenAI, as OpenAI has underestimated demand for its solution and wants to get ahead of demand going forward, and NVDA is uniquely positioned as the scale solution provider that could help OpenAI with this infrastructure buildout. The deal is for at least 10GW of AI infrastructure, and mgmt. confirmed that historically, NVDA’s TAM was $30bn-$40bn per GW, although going forward it could be higher. The deal would include GPUs, racks, networking and software. The OpenAI deal is additive to what NVDA was expecting before We Estimate $5.5bn in Additional Revs for NVDA in 2HCY26.

2025-09-19 22:49:43,r/stocks,Regarding Investing in Stocks - Scalping/Swings. How often to check companies financials?,"Investing in stocks, using company (valuations, financials, ownership, performance and technical) analysis.

How often should I be checking up on the overall performance of the stock? For example, Invested in a quantum stock 2 days ago, was already up 7% and sold for profit. I'm not afraid of taxes as long as I'm making profit and reinvesting in other companies that are moving fast.

Should I be checking them everyday, every week? I know trends move and money flows... I've been keeping tight numbers of whats doing good etc... I have long term investments and short term, but the short term is what I want to be watching.

Saw a post somewhere that said 15% profit on stocks are a good exit? Obviously doing this comes risk of missing a potential runner like (PLTR,NVDA) if I were to find that startup company early and selling for a short gain.

Any tips of this type of thing? Like if X company losses X value daily / weekly in a row exit position?",0,brian-augustin,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nlf2rd/regarding_investing_in_stocks_scalpingswings_how/,1nlf2rd

Intel and Nvidia are working on custom data center CPUs that Nvidia will integrate into its AI platforms as well as GPU tiles that Intel will integrate into its upcoming client processors. In both cases CPUs and GPUs will use Nvidia's NVLink technology as an I/O interface. By now, there are three teams working together on the joint projects.

The work began around a year ago, and preliminary agreements were reached by Intel's then-CEO Pat Gelsinger and Nvidia's Jensen Huang even before that.

&gt;In a deal reminiscent of recent AI talent acquisitions made by Meta and Google, Nvidia is paying cash and stock in the transaction, according to two people familiar with the arrangement. The deal closed last week, and Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar has joined Nvidia, said the people, who asked not to be named because the matter is private.

&gt;Nvidia has served as the backbone of the AI boom that began with the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in late 2022. The company’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which are generally purchased in large clusters, power the training of large language models and allow for big cloud providers to offer AI services to clients.

&gt;Enfabrica, founded in 2019, says its technology can connect more than 100,000 GPUs. It’s a solution that could help Nvidia offer integrated systems around its chips so clusters can effectively serve as a single computer.

2025-09-17 22:24:07,r/NVDA_Stock,Does NVDA appreciate during market hours or in the after hours and overnight?,"I was curious if overall returns for the stock market typically take place during the trading day or essentially gap up and down for their net returns.  I asked Chat GPT and it was interesting to learn that almost all returns take place after hours.  

  
In order to calculate this for NVDA, I needed to upload the daily date which I did for five years.  You may find the results interesting.

  
Here’s what the numbers show for **NVIDIA (NVDA), last 5 years**:

# Cumulative Returns (approx.)

* **Overnight (Close → Next Open):** **+518%**
* **Intraday (Open → Close):** **+118%**
* **Total Price Appreciation:** **+1,246%**

# Contribution to Total Gain

* **Overnight:** \~**41.6%** of total appreciation
* **Intraday:** \~**9.4%** of total appreciation
* **The rest** (about 49%) comes from compounding effects — since overnight and intraday gains multiply together across thousands of days, they don’t add linearly.

# Takeaway

For NVDA, unlike the broad market (where nearly all gains are overnight), **both overnight and intraday sessions contributed strongly to the stock’s massive 5-year run**. Roughly 40%+ of the appreciation happened overnight, \~10% intraday, and compounding magnified the total far beyond either piece alone.



ME: Would that essentially equal 80% overnight and 20% intra-day?

# ChatGPT said:

Not quite — here’s the subtlety.

When we talk about “shares of total appreciation,” it’s tricky because returns **compound multiplicatively**. If you just add the raw log returns, it looks like overnight = 80% and intraday = 20%. But when you translate back into actual price appreciation, the compounding means each leg’s contribution is less than that simple split.

For NVDA’s last 5 years:

* Overnight cumulative return: **+518%**
* Intraday cumulative return: **+118%**
* Total return: **+1,246%**

If you compare **each leg vs. total**:

* Overnight: ≈ **42%** of the total appreciation
* Intraday: ≈ **9%**
* The remainder (≈49%) is the *compounding overlap* (overnight × intraday growth reinforcing each other).

# In Plain English

* If you forced a two-way split ignoring compounding, you might say “\~80% overnight, \~20% intraday.”
* But the *true attribution* (accounting for compounding) is more like **40% overnight, 10% intraday, 50% compounding interaction**.

2025-09-17 14:40:39,r/NVDA_Stock,China bans tech companies from buying Nvidia’s AI chips,"China’s internet regulator has banned the country’s biggest technology companies from buying Nvidia’s artificial intelligence chips, as Beijing steps up efforts to boost its domestic industry and compete with the US.

The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) told companies, including ByteDance and Alibaba, this week to end their testing and orders of the RTX Pro 6000D, Nvidia’s tailor-made product for the country, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.

Several companies had indicated they would order tens of thousands of the RTX Pro 6000D, and had started testing and verification work with Nvidia’s server suppliers, the people said.

After receiving the CAC order, the companies told their suppliers to stop the work, the people added.

The ban goes beyond earlier guidance from regulators that focused on the H20, Nvidia’s other China-only chip widely used for AI. It comes after Chinese regulators concluded that domestic chips had attained performance comparable to those of Nvidia’s models used in China.

Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, told reporters in London on Wednesday that he expected to discuss the chipmaker’s ability to do business in China with Donald Trump that evening during the US president’s state visit to the UK.

“We can only be in service of a market if the country wants us to be,” he said. “I’m disappointed with what I see. But they have larger agendas to work out, between China and the US, and I’m understanding of that. We are patient about it.”

Beijing is putting pressure on Chinese tech companies to boost the country’s homegrown semiconductor industry and break their reliance on Nvidia so it can compete in an AI race against the US.

“The message is now loud and clear,” said an executive at one of the tech companies. “Earlier, people had hopes of renewed Nvidia supply if the geopolitical situation improves. Now it’s all hands on deck to build the domestic system.”

Nvidia started producing chips tailored for the Chinese market after former US President Joe Biden banned the company from exporting its most powerful products to China, in an effort to rein in Beijing’s progress on AI.

Beijing’s regulators have recently summoned domestic chipmakers such as Huawei and Cambricon, as well as Alibaba and search engine giant Baidu, which also make their own semiconductors, to report how their products compare against Nvidia’s China chips, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter.

They concluded that China’s AI processors had reached a level comparable to or exceeding that of the Nvidia products allowed under export controls, the person added.

Recommended Nvidia China says Nvidia violated antitrust law when it bought Mellanox

The Financial Times reported last month that China’s chipmakers were seeking to triple the country’s total output of AI processors next year.

“The top-level consensus now is there’s going to be enough domestic supply to meet demand without having to buy Nvidia chips,” said an industry insider.

Nvidia introduced the RTX Pro 6000D in July during Huang’s visit to Beijing, when the US company also said Washington was easing its previous ban on the H20 chip.

China’s regulators, including the CAC, have warned tech companies against buying Nvidia’s H20, asking them to justify having purchased them over domestic products, the FT reported last month.

The RTX Pro 6000D, which the company has said could be used in automated manufacturing, was the last product Nvidia was allowed to sell in China in significant volumes.

Alibaba, ByteDance, the CAC and Nvidia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Reuters7:01 PM ET Sep-13-2025

By Jarrett Renshaw

Sept 13 (Reuters) - The United Kingdom and the U.S. are preparing to sign a landmark technology agreement in the coming days as part of President Donald Trump's visit to the UK, the British Embassy in Washington said on Saturday.

This agreement aims to bolster collaboration between the two nations' trillion-dollar tech sectors, enhancing opportunities for businesses and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.

While the final details were still being negotiated, the embassy said the partnership will focus on key technologies, including artificial intelligence, semiconductors, telecommunications, and quantum computing.

""Cutting-edge technology such as AI and quantum computing will transform our lives,"" UK Technology Secretary Liz Kendall, who was appointed to her role on September 5, said in a statement.

Trump is set to fly to the UK on Tuesday for a second state visit, which is expected to last three days. He is due to be accompanied by a delegation of U.S. executives including Nvidia Corp (NVDA.NaE) CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI's Sam Altman.

&gt;**Historically, individual GPUs are more powerful (and more expensive) than a comparable TPU:** A single H200 has close to 2x the FLOPs/s of a TPU v5p and 1.5x the HBM. At the same time, the sticker price on Google Cloud is around $10/hour for an H200 compared to $4/hour for a TPU v5p. TPUs generally rely more on networking multiple chips together than GPUs.

&gt;**TPUs have a lot more fast cache memory.** TPUs also have a lot more VMEM than GPUs have SMEM (+TMEM), and this memory can be used for storing weights and activations in a way that lets them be loaded and used extremely fast. This can make them faster for LLM inference if you can consistently store or prefetch model weights into VMEM.

Do note that that's the H200 price on Google Cloud... which is quite expensive. It's $1.49 per hour on Lambda: [https://lambda.ai/pricing](https://lambda.ai/pricing)",14,Charuru,https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/gpus/#gpus-vs-tpus-at-the-chip-level,1nfell4

2025-09-12 04:57:35,r/stocks,"OpenAI, ORCL, NVDA and the UK","The question has to be asked, who is funding OpenAI moving forward? 

$300 billion to Oracle. Projected cash burn through 2029 is $115 billion (as of a few days ago). And now this comes out:   OPENAI, NVIDIA TO ANNOUNCE BILLIONS IN UK DATA CENTER PROJECTS

So that lands them in the realm of needing maybe $500+ billion in the next 4 years? They don’t make money, they burn money, so it’s not coming out of pocket. Maybe they go public and aim for a 1 trillion starting valuation? I know there are changes with their MSFT deal happening right now, not sure if listing is on the table. Or is the US government just giving them a blank check? None of these options seem overly likely.

$ wise none of this adds up, and it’s really starting to look like a giant scam to me. Yes ai has great uses, yes it is not going anywhere. But it’s also not profitable, at all. Not even close. All of the mega caps are burning huge amounts of money getting this all set up, with the plan to monetize it down the road. META had its panic moment when they started overpaying to poach talent, probably because they realized that llm’s hit a wall that would result in ai not being as profitable as projected. 

I think we may be in the stage where all companies start lying about future capex and revenue streams. At this point they have to. Just look at NVDA, renting back its own products lol, clever, but not actually a good thing. 

If the mega caps admit they need to scale back the ai roll out or drastically extend the timelines to complete these data center projects, then bye bye stock price. But it is hard for public companies to just straight up lie. OpenAI has less public eyeballs on their books. Can they really afford all of this? They are saying they can, and ORCL had an amazing day thanks to that. So maybe that is the play now. As the music gets closer to stopping, we will see more and more projects get announced from OpenAI and possibly some of the other non-publicly traded ai companies. 

These lies buy the industry time, which will allow the publicly traded companies to do offerings, maybe sell some stock, and just generally prepare for the coming market downturn. In turn, they agree to support the companies that are helping them fake these expansion / future revenue numbers right now. Because when the ball drops, and the capex bonfire is still burning hot, it’s going to get ugly. 

When will this finally fall apart? Who knows. Maybe 3 months. Maybe 1 year. Maybe 2 years if the government drops rates to zero and hands out blank checks to all ai companies. But it will hit, and it won’t be pretty. The warning signs are already showing. ",45,Consistent_Fish_7658,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nes68a/openai_orcl_nvda_and_the_uk/,1nes68a

* Thesis: **AI transforms labor itself**, not just IT stack, fueling demand pre-ROI.

Full Comment: ""We believe the growth in AI compute demand will drive enough demand to sustain NVDA’s growth into next year and likely beyond. While there are still several cross-currents, we believe those are not enough to change that trajectory and are upgrading to BUY from Neutral, raising our price target to $210 from $195. Our increasingly optimistic view of the growth in AI compute demand supersedes our list of concerns regarding NVDA. Our perspective that AI will transform work through labor itself, as opposed to the IT tech stack, lends itself to a continued ramp in compute demand even before enterprise customers see a return on investment.""",21,stocksavvy_ai,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1ne5urm/nvidia_da_davidson_upgrades_to_buy_pt_raised_to/,1ne5urm

2025-09-10 23:39:52,r/NVDA_Stock,Another Giant Leap: The Rubin CPX Specialized Accelerator &amp; Rack,"A new article from SemiAnalysis claims the new Rubin CPX chip is a gamechanger for Nvidia.  It's a really long, detailed article.  Here are some TLDR highlights from a Chatgpu summary:

- NVIDIA continues to out-innovate competitors by moving faster in system-level specialization — not just pushing raw GPU specs, but by re-architecting racks, networking, and BOM to optimize cost and performance, forcing rivals to constantly rework their roadmaps and chase from behind

- Rubin CPX is a prefill-specialized GPU - lots of FP4 compute, far less memory bandwidth, and 128 GB of GDDR7 instead of HBM.  Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX racks integrate both R200 (decode) and CPX (prefill), while a dual-rack option lets datacenters add CPX racks separately for flexible scaling.

- Competitors must restart the race. AMD, Google, AWS, Meta, and others custom chip makers that were converging on NVL72-style racks must now add a second, specialized prefill SKU and re-validate entire systems.  

- By cutting HBM and CoWoS packaging, CPX lowers memory cost per GB by &gt;50% and achieves ~60% of R200’s compute at ~25% of its cost—boosting FLOPs per dollar and margins. Dramatically lowers the cost of prefill tokens, improving inference TCO and margins.

2025-09-10 19:52:51,r/NVDA_Stock,Why NVDA + AVGO combo might be the smart play,"Been seeing a lot of chatter about whether Broadcom's OpenAI deal means we should dump NVDA for AVGO. After digging into this, I think that's missing the bigger picture. These companies aren't really competing - they're complementary. NVDA dominates general-purpose AI compute with their GPUs and CUDA ecosystem, while Broadcom focuses on custom ASICs for hyperscalers and the networking infrastructure that connects all those data centers together. Hell, NVDA is literally a Broadcom customer for some networking tech.

The AI market is exploding so fast there's room for multiple winners. NVDA's roughly 77% CAGR over 5 years vs AVGO's eye-opening \~954% total return (about 60.6% CAGR) shows both are absolutely crushing it. Instead of picking sides, I'm thinking of a barbell approach, maybe 60/40 or 50/50 split depending on risk tolerance. NVDA gives you pure AI upside exposure, AVGO gives you stability with that sweet dividend and diversified revenue streams.

- Nvidia and its partners submitted some serious benchmarks for the new Blackwell Ultra class GPUs. And of course, as has been the case since the beginning of MLPerf, Nvidia ran all the models and beat back all the competition, the few that had the gumption to compete.

- The MI355 looks good, however most of the 2.7X increase (probably close to 2x) in tokens/second is attributable to the use of FP4, first supported on the MI350. FP4 has improved efficiency by up to 2X for all GPU vendors that support the smaller format while preserving accuracy.

**James Schneider**  
*Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division*

Very good. Now the H20 is your product for the China market. Maybe talk to us about any update you can provide on demand for the H20? What needs to happen for you to ship that product in Q3 to China? And maybe just talk about the broader confidence in your China business overall?

**Colette Kress**  
*Executive VP &amp; CFO*

Yes, we did receive a license approval and have received licenses for several of our key customers in China. And we do want that opportunity to complete that and actually ship the H20 architecture to them. Right now, there is still in this position right now, a little geopolitical situation that we need to work through between the two governments. Our customers in China do want to make sure that our China government is also very well received in terms of receiving the H20 to them. But we do believe there is a strong possibility that this will occur.

And so it could add additional revenue. It's still hard to determine how much within the quarter. We talked about it being about a $2 billion to $5 billion potential opportunity if we can get through that geopolitical statement.",38,Jauss123,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4820686-nvidia-corporation-nvda-presents-at-goldman-sachs-communicopia-technology-conference-2025,1nc7gp5

In terms of the way how AI works, they are gonna need a lot more computation than we’ve ever had. Thus we need the energy (in all forms), and the numbers are profound. People are planning 10GW data centers. Just to do the translation: nuclear power plant in the U.S. is 1 GW.”

According to Smith’s words, the most benefited sectors will be: GPUs focused on computing power, auxiliary sectors to semiconductors, data centers focused on energy efficiency, renewables, nuclear power and grids.

2025-09-06 18:43:59,r/NVDA_Stock,BofA on AVGO vs Nvidia,"**BofA) Broadcom: “Shock-and-Awe” results — accelerating AI pipeline, powerful operating leverage, Price Objective (PO) $400**  
  
1. Accelerating AI pipeline; estimates raised 20–35%; EPS potential of $17–$20  
We reiterate our Buy rating and keep AVGO as our top pick. We see a high likelihood that a fourth mega customer (reported by the press as OpenAI) joins Broadcom’s custom AI chip (XPU) business alongside the existing three (Google, Meta, ByteDance). With roughly $10B of incremental revenue in 2HFY26E, we lift our FY26 AI growth outlook from YoY 55–60% to about 110%. AVGO also indicated growth could further accelerate in FY27E on additional programs and new customers. Meanwhile, opex is expected to grow a modest 5–8%, creating substantial operating leverage and lining up with a period when AVGO deploys more cash to debt paydown. Net, we raise our FY26/FY27 EPS estimates by 21%/35% to $9.62/$13.36. Note: our FY27 assumes a more conservative AI growth of 50–65% YoY. If FY27 were to grow at a FY26-like 110%+ pace, EPS potential could approach $17–$20 on leverage. Reflecting faster EPS growth and accelerating profit, we lift our PO from $300 to $400, applying 37x FY26 P/E (prior 35x).  
  
2. As the AI pie expands, AVGO’s share rises  
We agree AVGO is taking more share, but the overall AI market is also expanding toward the multi-trillion-dollar TAM cited by NVDA. Assuming AVGO and NVDA are the only two suppliers for now, we estimate AVGO’s CY25E share of computing + networking AI at \~11% ($23B out of $205B consolidated data-center revenue). Taking AVGO’s commentary at face value, AI revenue could approach $100B by CY27E, implying share could more than double to 24% ($100B of $418B). While such a scenario could pressure NVDA’s stock in the short term, we see greater risk that our NVDA CY27 data-center revenue forecast ($318B in our model) is actually conservative. AVGO’s custom silicon, networking, and scale are compelling, but they are (mostly) limited to internal workloads—not enterprise, not government, and not emerging-cloud facing—and exclude software or developer support. Over time, the evolution of “internal-use” vs “external-facing” markets could shift share between NVDA and AVGO.  
  
3. Risks: customer concentration; ASIC/networking competition  
We note Google accounts for 30%+ of FY25E semiconductor revenue. Concentration risk is unavoidable in capital-intensive AI, but AVGO’s exposure to Google (15–20% of total FY25 revenue; 30%+ on semiconductor revenue alone, by our estimate) is notable. Unexpected order changes, new competitors, or content shifts (e.g., memory disaggregation) could raise risk. Second, NVDA’s improved networking stack is intensifying competition in networking, especially in clusters where NVDA’s rack-scale solutions are deployed.

2025-09-05 19:40:15,r/stocks,"2 years ago I had asked about AI's impact on storage stocks like STX, WD, etc. Is it AI's impact or something else as STX is up 3x since ?","Is it attributable to AI's impact or this is normal cyclical effect ? Can experts in storage industry weigh in ?

Last time top comments suggested other storage providers over STX &amp; WD. But since then, 

STX up 3x

WD up 2x.

If not direct demand for their products, is this an indirect demand ?

Do you believe it will last longer like in 2030s ? Or this will be gone by then ? What is your hypothesis ?

\-----------here is that post and details---------

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16uwit6/ai\_while\_ai\_revolution\_is\_benefiting\_nvda\_how/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16uwit6/ai_while_ai_revolution_is_benefiting_nvda_how/)

AI depends on data. This data will need to be stored somewhere. Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) do most of the storing of world's data currently. SSDs (solid state/flash) carry the rest of the data.

[https://blocksandfiles.com/2022/05/16/monday-gartner-hdd-ssd-numberfest/](https://blocksandfiles.com/2022/05/16/monday-gartner-hdd-ssd-numberfest/)

Will AI need more HDD or SSD ? Or both and hence demand for both will go up ?

There are only few (like 3/4 ?) manufacturers of storage. STX, WD, Toshiba being the major ones. While their recent quarter revenues haven't yet shown any large demand related to AI and revenues haven't shown increase like that in NVDA revenue, wouldn't in the future they will have more AI driven demand ? like multiple times of current demand ?

If yes, how come these stocks are down ? recent revenues were down but isn't that like ignoring the potential demand from AI requirements ?

Or will AI become smart enough (learn using existing data) to require not much additional storage and thus there won't be much demand growth due to AI for storage?

(Reuters) -China's Alibaba has developed a new chip that is more versatile than its older chips and is meant to serve a broader range of AI inference tasks, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The chip, now in testing, is manufactured by a Chinese company, in contrast to an earlier Alibaba AI processor that was fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the report said.

Alibaba did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Chinese tech and AI companies have been focusing heavily on homegrown technology at a time when leading AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) has faced regulatory issues in selling its products in the country.

Nvidia's H20 chip, the most powerful AI processor it is allowed to sell in China, was effectively blocked from sale in the market earlier this year by the Trump administration.

While the U.S. last month allowed Nvidia to resume sales of H20 to China, Chinese firms have been working on processors that could substitute H20. Beijing has also put pressure on tech giants, including Alibaba and ByteDance, over purchases of the H20 chip.

Nvidia developed the H20 specifically for China following U.S. export restrictions on its other AI processors in 2023. The H20 does not have as much computing power as Nvidia's H100 or its Blackwell series.

Alibaba is China's biggest cloud-computing company and is among the top customers of Nvidia.

Separately, on Friday, the company reported a 26% jump in revenue in its cloud computing segment for the April-June quarter, beating market estimates, on the back of solid demand.",363,chinese__investor,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n3dv7e/alibaba_unveils_homegrown_ai_chip_to_replace/,1n3dv7e

2025-08-28 20:52:45,r/NVDA_Stock,Networking Revenue,"Overall a great quarter and strong forward guidance for nex quarter. I think it has been understated how much their networking products have grown their revenue. 

Obviously NVIDIA has touted their new products, we seen Jensen at GTC show off their NVLINK and Ethernet/Infiniband products but not so much chatter from financial commentators. 

Outside their other segments they have a really strong opportunity to grow their networking business in HPC and Telecommunications and also grow their underrepresented cloud software, service, and support business.

The growth story is still there, we are going to see more revenue growth in data center compute revenue with Blackwell ultra and Rubin products. Networking and their other segments are going to also grow. I think they are going to start eating Cisco and Palo Alto Networks lunch if they keep developing their product line like their Bluefield DPU. A lot of this growth would not be possible without their strategic acquisition of mellanox in 2020. There are a lot of long play opportunities in the making for NVIDIA, so don’t sell them short when their ventures don’t have immediate payoff.

2025-08-28 12:23:54,r/NVDA_Stock,Here are the key points &amp; takeaways from the Nvidia Earnings call yesterday.,"**Growth in Infrastructure guided to be very strong:**

* CEO expects massive continued growth with ""very, very significant forecast"" from large customers for next year. 
* “Over the next 5 years, we're going to scale into a $3 to $4 trillion AI infrastructure opportunity. Essentially $2B in compute spend”.
* “Capex from the top four CSPs has doubled and grown to about $600 billion. We are at the beginning of this build-out”
* CRWV higher on the comments. NBIS wasn't but should follow. 

**DATA CENTER REVNUES HIGHLY CONCNETRATED**

* They disclosed that one customer drove 23% of  Q2 sales ($10.8B) and another 16% ($7.5B). That’s nearly $18.3B combined, all tied to Compute &amp; Networking (data center)
* HIGHLY LIKLEY TO BE AMZN AND MSFT. 
* Cloud service providers about 50% of Q2 data center revenue

**Supply constraints:**

* ""Everything is sold out. H100s sold out. H200s are sold out"" with hyperscalers ""renting capacity from other CSPs."" Long-term sees growth into the $600B annual hyperscaler CapEx market through ""the decade.""

**On CHINA:**

* ""The China market, I've estimated, to be about $50 billion of opportunity for us this year"" - expecting it to ""grow say, 50% per year"" like the rest of the AI market.
* There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter. 
* “We have not included H20 in our Q3 outlook as we continue to work through geopolitical issues.”
* We could ship between $2B-$5B worth of H20 chips to China if tensions ease. They also noted that with more orders, they could increase billing.
* While U.S. officials have talked about a possible 15% revenue-sharing requirement, no formal regulation has been put in place yet.

**RUBIN platform already in production, already taped out:**

* Rubin platform already in production: ""six new chips...have all taped out to TSMC"" representing ""3rd generation NVLink Rack Scale AI supercomputer"" with ""much more mature and fully scaled up supply chain.""

**Bullsih commentary on robotics:**

* ""The age of physical AI has arrived unlocking entirely new industries in robotics, industrial automation, every industry in every industrial company, will need to build two factories.""

**Blackwell:**

*  Blackwell will be ""the lion's share"" of the $7B sequential data center growth - ""you should expect Blackwell again to be the driver of the growth"" for Q3 guidance beat. 

**Sovereign demand is red hot:**

* We’re on track to generate over $20B in Sovereign AI revenue this year.” The EU also plans to invest $20B to build 20 AI factories across France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, including five gigafactories.",35,TearRepresentative56,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1n28i4u/here_are_the_key_points_takeaways_from_the_nvidia/,1n28i4u

Full Comment:

""Key stock takeaways: We expect the stock to trade down modestly following an in-line quarter and guidance against a backdrop of elevated expectations heading into the call, as we believe that the upside from Blackwell ramp has been largely contemplated in our and Street estimates. Management noted that it did not ship any H20 products to China in the quarter. On the conference call, we expect investors to focus on: (1) commentary on customer demand and any supply chain constraints; (2) visibility into 2026 revenue and the Rubin product launch; (3) incremental details on Nvidia’s China business; (4) gross margin trends. Quarterly results were essentially in line with the Street: Nvidia reported revenue of $46.7 bn, just below GS at $47.0 bn but modestly above the Street at $46.5 bn. Gross margin of 72.4% was in line with GS and the Street at 72.3%. Operating margin of 64.5% was above GS at 64.0% and the Street at 63.5%. Operating EPS of $1.04 was in line with GS at $1.05 and above the Street at $1.02. Data Center revenue of $41.1 bn was below GS at $41.9 bn and the Street at $41.3 bn. Gaming revenue of $4.3 bn was above GS and the Street at $3.9 bn. Professional Visualization revenue of $601 mn was above GS and the Street at $534 mn. Automotive revenue of $586 mn was in line with GS at $583 mn and the Street at $586 mn. 3Q guidance is in line with the Street. Nvidia guided 3Q revenue and gross margin in line with the Street. Revenue was guided to $54.0 bn at the midpoint, which is below GS at $57.0 bn and in line with the Street at $53.9 bn. Non-GAAP gross margin was guided to 73.5%, essentially in line with GS at 73.7% and the Street at 73.6%. OpEx was guided to $4.2 bn, OI&amp;E was guided to $500 mn and the non-GAAP tax rate was guided to 16.5%. Implied non-GAAP EPS (ex SBC) of $1.22 was below GS at $1.31 and in line with the Street at $1.22. Read-through to our coverage: We believe the in-line Data Center segment result in 2Q and 3Q guidance points to a solid AI-spending environment against a backdrop of higher expectation, and is essentially neutral for our digital semiconductor coverage including Broadcom, AMD, and Marvell. Price target and risks: We are Buy rated on NVDA. Our 12-month target price of $200 is based on a 35X P/E multiple applied to our normalized EPS estimate of $5.75. Key downside risks include: (1) slowdown in AI infrastructure spending, (2) share erosion due to increased competitive intensity, (3) margin erosion due to increased competition; (4) supply constraints.""",90,stocksavvy_ai,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1n1y1z6/nvidia_nvda_goldman_sachs_reiterates_buy_pt_200/,1n1y1z6

2025-08-27 22:26:38,r/stocks,NVDA 2Q26 Earnings Result,"**Earnings per share**: $1.05, adjusted, up 54% from a year ago

**Revenue**: Revenue of $46.7 billion, up 6% from Q1 and up 56% from a year ago

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for the second quarter ended July 27, 2025, of $46.7 billion, up 6% from the previous quarter and up 56% from a year ago. NVIDIA’s Blackwell Data Center revenue grew 17% sequentially.

There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter. NVIDIA benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory, from approximately $650 million in unrestricted H20 sales to a customer outside of China.

Data Center revenue for the second quarter was $41.1 billion, up 56% from a year ago and up 5% sequentially. The strong year-on-year and sequential growth was driven by demand for our accelerated computing platform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative and agentic AI applications. We continue to ramp our Blackwell architecture, which grew 17% sequentially, including our newest architecture, Blackwell Ultra. We recognized Blackwell revenue across all customer categories, led by large cloud service providers, which represented approximately 50% of Data Center revenue.

Data Center compute revenue was $33.8 billion, up 50% from a year ago. Sequentially, compute revenue declined 1%, driven by a $4.0 billion reduction in H20 sales. Networking revenue was $7.3 billion, up 98% from a year ago and up 46% sequentially, driven by the growth of NVLink compute fabric for GB200 and GB300 systems, the ramp of XDR InfiniBand products, and adoption of Ethernet for AI solutions at cloud service providers and consumer internet companies.

**Outlook**  
NVIDIA’s outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows:

* Revenue is expected to be $54.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. The company has not assumed any H20 shipments to China in the outlook.
* GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 73.3% and 73.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The company continues to expect to exit the year with non-GAAP gross margins in the mid-70% range.
* GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $5.9 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively. Full year fiscal 2026 operating expense growth is expected to be in the high-30% range.
* GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense are expected to be an income of approximately $500 million, excluding gains and losses from non-marketable and publicly-held equity securities.
* GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 16.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items.",474,thelastsubject123,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n1s58d/nvda_2q26_earnings_result/,1n1s58d

2025-08-27 13:05:58,r/NVDA_Stock,These are the key issues to watch heading into the NVDA earnings tonight. The earnings will be won or loss on the basis of these key issues. Trader positioning into the print is currently bullish. Lots of gamma on 185C in particular.,"* Implied move is 6%.
* Nvidia represents a 8% stake in SPY, 10% of QQQ, 22.5% of SMH. 

**KEY ISSUES FOR THE EARNINGS REPORT TO FOCUS ON, AS WELL AS MY COMMENTARY ON THESE TOPICS:**

**Overall demand:**

* Overall demand is strong, with Texas data centers adding 40GW of new power demand. The four major CSPs’ 2026 Capex forecast was raised by $75 billion in July, reaching nearly $400 billion, with capital intensity expected to rise to 41%, almost double that of 2023.

**China:**

* H20 demand remains uncertain: on the one hand, customers are being discouraged from purchasing; on the other hand, projects such as Deepseek R2 were delayed due to lack of H20. AI firm DeepSeek delayed its R2 model after struggling to train it on Huawei’s Ascend chips, which Chinese authorities pushed them to use instead of NVDA chips.
* Overall, China’s market is expected to restore several billion dollars of revenue per quarter, but the question will be how quickly China can come back. For reference, Nvidia expected \~$20B from China before the restrictions and write-offs. 

**MARGINS:**

* Margins will be the key issue here.  There has been talk of potential margin pressure on early GB300 ramps the the market will want clarity on. 
* Also, a 15% license fee will be incurred on Chinese revenue, which is expected to impact gross margin by 50–60bps. There has been speculation that Nvidia will offset that with price hikes, which we will have to see confirmation of.  FQ3 gross margin is expected to be 73.5%.
* Roughly one-third of survey respondents expect gross margin to be \~58%, while the other two-thirds are still clustered around 65–72%, despite the sell-side consensus remaining at 71.1%.
* So its a pretty mixed field on margins:, and they will be a key point of interest for this print. 

**New Markets:**

* Saudi AI firm Humain, has broken ground on its first data centers in Riyadh and Dammam. Operations are set for early 2026, each starting with up to 100MW capacity. Tareq Amin says Humain has approval to buy 18,000 of Nvidia’snewest AI chips, pending U.S. clearance. 

**Blackwell GPUs:**

* GPU output increased +20% QoQ in CQ2 and is expected to rise another +30% in CQ3, reaching about 5 million units for the year, with an ASP of about $33,000. Very strong: Hon Hai expects Q3 cabinet shipments of about 4.6k units (vs 1.15k in Q2), while Quanta confirmed that customers are ramping Blackwell Ultra. 
* xAI to purchase 300K Blackwell B200 GPUs, per Elon Musk comment
* Oracle commited to purchase 400K Nvidia GB200 (\~$40 billion purchase)
* CRWV tested a 16-GPU NVIDIA H100 system against just four GPUs on the new NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 infrastructure and observed over 6x higher raw throughput per GPU on the GB300.

**New products:**

* NVDA just launched its Jetson Thor robotics computers, built for “physical AI” in industries like logistics, healthcare and manufacturing. 
* We may get more updates on robotics products. ",3,TearRepresentative56,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1n1e08m/these_are_the_key_issues_to_watch_heading_into/,1n1e08m

2025-08-25 19:11:36,r/stocks,NVDA Up 35% Into Earnings,"Nvidia reports earnings on Wednesday (Aug 27) after the close, and the setup looks like a textbook high-stakes event. The stock is currently trading at $181.30, up over 35% in the past three months, and the technicals tell a mixed story heading into earnings. On the positive side, the long-term trend is still strong. Nvidia is trading above its 10-day ($179), 50-day ($167), and 200-day ($137) moving averages, which confirms that the uptrend remains intact and the bulls are in control on a broader timeframe.

However, the short-term signals show some cracks. The RSI sits at 73.4, which is firmly in overbought territory. To be clear, this doesn’t always mean the stock will drop immediately, but it does raise the probability of profit-taking in the near term. The MACD has slipped below the signal line (2.92 vs. 4.43), and the histogram has been shrinking since mid-August, indicating fading momentum. Volume has also flatlined while price continued to rise, often a sign that buyers are running out of steam ahead of a major catalyst.

Historically, Nvidia tends to move around ±8% after its earnings announcements. Given the massive run it’s already had this quarter, the risk/reward skews toward the downside. Yes, if Nvidia beats expectations and raises guidance, the stock could break through $190–200 and extend its rally. But with RSI overbought, MACD momentum weakening, and volume drying up, there’s also a real chance of a “sell the news” reaction back toward $170 to 160, even on solid earnings.

TLDR: The long-term trend remains bullish, but in the short-term, Nvidia is priced for perfection. Technicals suggest momentum is tiring, so investors should be prepared for volatility and not be surprised if the first reaction is red before the next leg higher.",370,Basat098,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mzwfjs/nvda_up_35_into_earnings/,1mzwfjs

2025-08-20 15:43:24,r/NVDA_Stock,"NVIDIA (NVDA): HSBC raises PT to $200 (from $125), keeps Hold","Catalysts:

* **AI GPU TAM expansion** from CSP capex revisions (+37% YTD). 
* Growing **enterprise &amp; sovereign AI demand**. 
* **H20 licensing resumption** improves China market sentiment.

Risk Factors:

* **China AI GPU TAM uncertainties** remain. 
* **Lower ASPs** from revenue-sharing with U.S. authorities. 
* **Pushback in China** against using U.S. chips.

Full Comment: 

""2QFY26e and 3QFY26e on track, but China uncertainties remain: The AI GPU TAM is now bigger than our previous expectations from ongoing CSP capex revisions of 37% year-to-date, as well as a focus on enterprise and sovereign AI end markets. The market has also become more constructive on the China market from the resumption of H20 licensing. However, we believe China AI GPU TAM uncertainties remain and could disappoint the market, given lower ASP due to revenue sharing with the US administration, as well as a push back on using US chips from the Chinese authorities. Hence, we expect 2QFY26 sales of USD46.7bn to be a moderate beat vs management guidance of USD45bn and in line with consensus of USD46.3bn. We also expect 3QFY26e sales of USD53.9bn to meet consensus estimate of USD53.3bn, but this is unlikely to lead to significant upward revision given ongoing China uncertainties despite the reversal of H20 GPU export restrictions.""",38,stocksavvy_ai,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1mvf6ly/nvidia_nvda_hsbc_raises_pt_to_200_from_125_keeps/,1mvf6ly

""Into the Print: We See NVDA Best Positioned to Clear A High Bar; More Balanced On AVGO, MRVL, CRDO.

Positive on NVIDIA (Buy), as we see strong fundamentals and a clean narrative (despite the chaos and distraction surrounding H20 and China) as the Blackwell-Blackwell Ultra handoff is transitioning rapidly and smoothly. We note NVIDIA is trading at a discount to Broadcom (NASDAQ:[AVGO](https://www.investing.com/equities/avago-technologies)) despite what we see as a cleaner set-up, and we believe remains the best and cleanest way to play AI... still. We leave our well-above Street $55B OctQ estimate unchanged, which we note does not include H20 revenue given timing/magnitude uncertainty. We also see upside to our above-Street 2026 estimates, well beyond adding back datacenter sales to China.

2025-08-19 15:03:45,r/stocks,(08/19) Interesting Stocks Today - Softbank's Takes Stake in INTC!,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Intel's Ceo Draws Support For Revival From Softbank Trump](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-19/intel-s-ceo-draws-support-for-revival-from-softbank-trump?srnd=homepage-americas)

[**INTC (Intel)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&amp;p=d)\-SoftBank is buying stock equal to roughly 2% of Intel’s outstanding shares in a $2 billion investment, driving the stock up!! News hit AH yesterday, ultimately interested to see if INTC makes another run at the open and if we can sustain- we've made a massive 6% move already. Despite the bearish news of  US government potentially using CHIPS Act grants to buy equity in the company, SoftBank news seems purely bullish until we get more details. This hasn't moved other semis much (NVDA/AMD unaffected). Thank you Nana!!!

[**OPEN (Open Door)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OPEN&amp;p=d)\-Carrie Wheeler resigned as chair and CEO and the board launched a search for her replacement. This has caused the stock to explode from $2.50 -&gt; $4. Again, this has meme stock written all over it. Not too interested in any long-term plays, but interested in seeing if we can break $5 again. Currently short-biased.  Personally, I don't think this can make any kind of sustainable move because it's way too liquid to make any of those epic squeezes we've seen from other companies in the past- illiquidity is what drives the massive moves when people get squeezed. 

[**VKTX (Viking Therapeutics)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VKTX&amp;p=d)\-Its experimental obesity pill disappointed in a mid-stage study, marking another weaker-than-expected result for an oral alternative to popular weight-loss injections. ""VK2735, helped patients lose up to 12.2% of their body weight. However, roughly 28% of patients dropped out of the trial in just three months, dampening hopes that the pill could compete with treatments from LLY/NVO."" Had an epic spike to the upside then sold off close to 35%-mainly looking for a bounce in this stock if we reach $25 again.

[**APLD (**Applied Digital Corp**)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=APLD&amp;p=d)\-Announced they were breaking ground on Polaris Forge 2 - a $3B, 280MW AI factory in North Dakota. Cited ""unprecedented demand for AI compute infrastructure"". Interestingly enough, Sam Altman said yesterday that investors were ""overexcited about AI"".

Anyway, this stock has near doubled in the past 3 months and I'm interested to see if we can hold above $16. Hyperscalers are only viable if there's unrelenting demand and it seems that there isn't any reduction of demand (for now).

Muse, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, called the demand for AI compute “seemingly insatiable” in a recent note and raised his price target from $200 to $240 on Monday, for one of the highest targets on Wall Street.

Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh pointed out that Big Tech capex estimates have increased in recent months from 38% to 54% year over year. With analysts boosting outlooks on AI demand and hyperscaler capex, stocks like PLTR, BGM, CRM, and CRWV stand to benefit from the accelerating investment cycle.

* **China shipments** could add further upside.

Risk Factors:

*  Investor expectations already **moderately higher**. 
* **Supply constraints** still undershipping end demand.

Full Comment: 

""So how would we put this together around the quarter? We model $46.6bn in revenue for July, up from our prior $45.2bn, and $52.5bn in revenue for October vs our prior $51.3bn. We think investor expectations are moderately higher based on some of those supply inputs noted above, and we see the rationale for upside. But our assumption is that more of that comes in January; either way these figures represent numbers that are still undershipping end demand, and momentum should continue into next year, which is an important factor when thinking about a continued bid to the stock. Should China fully come back into the picture, that would be additive to our assumptions. As such, we are raising our 2026 estimates, from revenue/non-gaap EPS of $264.6bn/$6.28 to $273.2bn/$6.51. As far as our PT, we had assumed \~33x our MW CY25 EPS estimate of $6.02; we are maintaining that \~33x target multiple but on our now $6.25 in MW EPS that brings the PT to $206.""",53,stocksavvy_ai,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1mtj11j/nvidia_morgan_stanley_maintains_overweight_raises/,1mtj11j

2025-08-17 06:08:44,r/stocks,$APLD - 10 bagger AI DATA CENTER,"APLD is positioning themselves as one of the few players building the kind of high-performance data centers that AI workloads actually demand. We're talking racks stacked with GPU's pulling power at a massive scale.

On paper, they've got around 400MW scheduled to come online nby 2027. That's just what's already been announced. Management has been clear that if they can line up more power, they'll keep scaling aggressively. And when you run the numbers, the revenue potential starts looking pretty wild.

Here's the simple math: industry rates for high-performance hosting earn about $.35 to $.50 per watt per month, with AI workloads usually toward the higher end. Annualied that's $6,000 per kW, or $6M per MW. Multiply that by 400 MW and you're looking at roughly $2.4B in yearly revenue potential.

Even if you haircut that for more conservative assumptions- say $.40/watt and a 45% margin - it still works out to a business throwing off serious cash. Data center operators at scale tend to run 50% EBITDA margins, so $2.4B in revenue would translate into \~1.2B in EBITDA. And right now the market is valuing infrastructure names feeding the AI boom at 10-20x EBITDA. That points to a market cap anywhere from $12B on the low end to north of $20B if they execute well.

The bigger lever, though, is capacity. If they can find another 200-300 MW to build out on top of the 400 MW roadmap, the earnings power scales dramatically. The real bottleneck here isn't GPUs - it's electricity. APLD's edge is that their sites are in power-friendly locations where expansion is actually possible.

I originally came across this stock while doing some modeling work on NVDA for a client. CoreWeave, which NVDA owns a stake in, cut a deal with APLD not long ago - and the stock ripped up 50%. APLD is essentially a landlord, and companies like CoreWeave are the tenants, leasing AI power.

But the gist of it is China has funded a company that is trying to remove CUDA from the equation in the next 18-24 months which means all of the China revenue NVDA would generate would implode and who knows if the tech is cheaper and works better (or marginally worse but still by value is stronger) they could become a dominant player in the chips market.

There are a TON of factors that could either make this more or less legitimate of a concern but I thought it was something to keep an eye on.

**Edit:** oh my comment with the link got removed, DM if you want to read the blog (no stupid paywall).

**Edit2:** I'm seeing a lot of people misunderstanding, China is not trying to out compete NVDA in the market, they are funding a company to develop an alternative to CUDA that would be used inside of China by necessity and thus cut off China as a market for NVDA except for black market but that isn't going to be a very strong revenue source.

The deal, which grants export licenses for Nvidia's (NVDA.NaE) H20 chip and AMD's MI308 chip, ""is another bullish sign for AI-related tech stocks heading into the next 12 to 18 months,"" Wedbush said.

The unprecedented 15% fee ""is a small price to pay for access to China and other key markets around the world,"" the note said.

""There is one chip in the world fueling the AI Revolution and it's Nvidia (NVDA.NaE),"" Wedbush said. Globally over the next few years, ""there will be trillions of dollars up for grabs and right now that is heavily favored to go to US Big Tech,"" the note said.

Had the Trump administration blocked sales of Nvidia's (NVDA.NaE) H20 chip, ""this **essentially would have handed Huawei $15 billion per year on a silver platter,"" creating a ""major competitive advantage for Beijing and a self-inflicted wound by the US government**,"" Wedbush said.

2025-08-12 20:49:12,r/stocks,I just sold a decent amount of stock..,"32, $890k networth, I decided to be a little manic and sell a good amount of stock today. 

I sold: 

APLD +70%

NBIS +90%

ALAB +150%

RDDT +90%

ONDS +100%

SMCI +10% (small position)

That now puts me at 32% cash, not sure why I'm sharing, just thought I would, I see a lot of repetitive information on here, so I thought I would share something new. 

I also started a position in Dow Chemical, just 100 shares, but yeah

I thought about selling some $HOOD and possibly my $META position, but I've always told myself that those are my lifers, so not sure if I will or not. Might sell some $HOOD tomorrow if it pops when they release their July numbers. 

The list above were all stocks that I sold today. 

Within the last 3 months I've sold

$QQQ +60%

$ARKW +120%

$NVDA +270%

$VRT +40%

$AAPL +40%

Those are slight approximations, I hate how Fidelity doesn't show you the total gain on closed positions, but yeah. 

Not sure what I'll do with the cash, moved most of it to $SGOV, so $175k in $SGOV, 25k in Fidelity that I will slowly buy positions with and then like $87k in Robinhood cash position.

2025-08-12 19:12:09,r/stocks,Best stocks to bet against if you are bearish on AI.,"Aside from the obvious ones like NVDA, MSFT, META, which tickers would be suitable for shorting or buying puts on, if you are bearish on AI and believe we are in a bubble akin to the dot-com boom?

I see that there are two general categories companies can be placed into:

1. Those which actually provide some kind of AI infrastructure/software that other companies are using and paying for. NVDA, MSFT, META are the obvious ones. But this would also include companies like INOD which provide data labeling services that MSFT/META/etc pay for; or data center/chip related companies like APLD, NVTS, SITM

2. Companies which are simply ""using"" AI in some capacity, which may be providing actual value or may be just a gimmick to increase their stock price. For example SOUN, BBAI, CRNC, PYH, ICAD, DUOT.

If you wanted to take a conservative bearish position, I think the best way to do it would be to identify those companies in #2 whose core value proposition does not include AI but who are merely claiming to use AI to ride the AI hype train. However this might be hard to do.

A moderate bearish position would be to short/buy puts on all companies in #2.

A true bearish position would be to short all companies in #1.

Reuters5:39 PM ET Aug-10-2025

Aug 10 (Reuters) -

Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) and AMD have agreed to give the U.S. government 15% of their revenues from chip sales in China, under an arrangement to obtain export licenses for the semiconductors, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.

The revenue share applies to Nvidia's (NVDA.NaE) H20 chips and AMD's MI308 chips, the report said, citing a U.S. official, noting that the Trump administration had yet to determine how to use the money.

The chipmakers agreed to the arrangement as a condition for obtaining export licences for the Chinese market that were granted last week, FT reported.

Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) follows rules the U.S. government sets for its participation in worldwide markets, an Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed statement. ""While we haven't shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.""

AMD did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Commerce Department started issuing

licenses

to Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) to export its H20 chips to China last week, removing a significant hurdle to the artificial intelligence bellwether's access to a key market.

The U.S. last month reversed an April ban on the sale of the H20 chip to China. The company had tailored the microprocessor specially to the Chinese market to comply with the Biden-era AI chip export controls.

2025-08-11 00:45:51,r/stocks,CENTENE (CNC) is a good long term opportunity at this level,"Like every self-respecting Value investor, I've been looking for opportunities to divest from my tech-heavy portfolio. AI Stocks like NVDA, PLTR, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA have done great, but some of these valuations just don't make sense and I don't think now is a good time to buy into them anymore.

That brings me to look for other opportunities. I don't think there's a better opportunity right now than the Healthcare sector.

Historically, Healthcare has outperformed the S&amp;P, thanks to relatively stable stocks like CNC.

Let's take a step back. What the f\*%# happened to this stock in the past 2 months ?

They came out and :

1. Said that their Medical Loss Ratio(MLR) will be much higher because claims are getting expensive
2. Pulled guidance for 2025

Since then, they've had their Q2 Earnings call. They've revised guidance to a EPS of 1.75 for 2025 (from 7.5 previously, ouch). Given that their Q1 2025 EPS was 2.9, and their Q2 EPS was -0.16, this is pricing in a combined -1$ EPS for Q3 and Q4.

The bar is very low. Even a small sign of life from the CEO, could send this stock easily back to the 40 - 50 range, as a path to profitability is starting to be priced into the stock.

The recent headwind, albeit very impactful in the short to medium-term, is temporary. the CEO has said that they have already completed rate re-filings in the 29 states by now, and that the rate decision for each states will be expected in September. The new rates that determine the amount of premiums received, will take into account the high cost for behavioral health(therapists, psychiatric meds etc...),  home health services, and expensive drugs (Wegovy, Ozempic...) .

Compared to the giant UNH, CNC has a much better reputation, isn't under DOJ Investigation, and Ambetter, their Health Insurance Marketplace, has a claims denial rate of 14%, more than half that of UNH.

# Path back to profitability :

CEO and the team are now laser focused on restoring profitability by pulling the necessary levers :

\- identifying and reducing areas where claims have been too ""costly""

\- increasing premium rates, to account for the challenging environment, and with a worst case scenario in mind (continued high morbidity and utilization rate)

\- hinting at a stock buyback in the Earnings call

\- Immune from tariff BS and TACO

# Possible risks

\- The trend of high morbidity and drug use continues to escalate, leading to more people needing expensive surgeries and drugs ==&gt; unlikely, as people who fear that their benefits are being taken away with OBBBA, have already stocked up on drugs/done surgeries

\- continued political pressure on healthcare costs with bills like the OBBBA ==&gt; unlikely, as this bill seems to be a one-and-done on healthcare, and now the Administration will focus on other more pressing matters (Russia - Ukraine conflict, Inflation, crypto, tax bills for the rich etc ...).

Also, this is speculation, but I think the full impact of the OBBBA are wayyy overstated. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that by 2034, 16 million people will lose coverage, but that's a decade away. This will be accounted for in the rate re-pricing.

\- Risks of people changing Insurers because of higher rates ==&gt; given that every Health insurer will be increasing rates, among them: Elevance, UNH, Molina, Blue Cross Blue Shield, CNC will be no exception. People won't switch because none of the other options are better. Centene's health plan is pretty competitive, and compared to Molina health who's the most affordable, Centene's has much better coverage(available across 29 states vs 8 for Molina)

Overall, I think this is a compelling buy, not just for CNC, but for the Health care sector overall, as the benefits greatly outweigh the risk at this point. Historically, the Healthcare Sector has outperformed the S&amp;P, and this is the perfect time to buy in.",17,PleasantAnomaly,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mmwihz/centene_cnc_is_a_good_long_term_opportunity_at/,1mmwihz

NVDA: already 60% of my portfolio. Cuda locks customers in hard. If I pick 1 stock to all in, it's NVDA and I have zero worry. Plan to buy more.

TSM: in my portfolio. The chip manufacturer for the whole world. No one can replace or even compete with it. 

Microsoft: in my portfolio. Windows. Microsoft's cloud, AI data center. ChatGPT. 

Hood: used to be. Sadly I exited at 62 to switch to NVDA. Now it's exploded. Looking to add back. They have stocks/ crypto brokerage, banking, retirement account. I've been using Robinhood since 2017. Tried other apps as well but nothing can compare. I pay for robinhood gold and use their margin. Of all my picks, this one is the most debatable. But personally I just can't stop using this app. 

Meta: not in my portfolio. FB is where all businesses have to use. And they will keep paying for ads over and over again. I know because I am paying them for ads and for the blue ticker monthly. 

Google: in my portfolio. YouTube. Google's cloud and AI data center.

This showed up in my youtube feed a few days ago.  It's a 38 minute interview with Charlie Rose from PBS.  If you wonder why Nvidia is so far ahead in AI, Jensen articulates Nvidia's 20+ year focus on accelerated computing.

Highlights:

\- There's no groundbreaking info here, but it all reinforces Nvidia's leadership on reshaping the technology world from a cpu-focus to a gpu-focus.

\- Using CUDA and parallel processing allowing for 10-200x processing power increases gives researchers the ability to solve the greatest challenges in computing that were previously impossible to do.

\- Jensen gives an example (starting at 5:40 mark) about investing in ""zero billion dollar markets"".  A few years prior, a few Mass. General Hospital researchers asked Nvidia for software help to use gpus to process mammography CT scans in real time.  The potential gain to Nvidia was a mention in a research paper and maybe a few gpu sales.  A 1 1/2 year collaboration resulted in Nvidia working with every major medical-imaging company.

\- He talks about competing with Intel (at the time, Intel's market cap was $84B vs. $9B for Nvidia), how the CPU was optimized for text and numbers (think word processing and spreadsheets), and how GPUs would eventually become the new center of gravity for computing.

\- Zero mention of AI.  Alexnet, the ""big bang"" of AI, didn't happen until 2012.

\- Not every prediction worked out.  Jensen showed 3D Vision glasses that PC gamers could wear to play video games with 3D depth perception.  They never caught on.

Reuters4:48 AM ET Jul-31-2025

By Aditya Soni and Deborah Mary Sophia

(Reuters) -Big Tech is spending more than ever on artificial intelligence - but the returns are rising too, and investors are buying in.

AI played a bigger role in driving demand across internet search, digital advertising and cloud computing in the April-June quarter, powering revenue growth at technology giants Microsoft (MSFT.NaE), Meta, and Alphabet.

Betting that momentum will sustain, Microsoft (MSFT.NaE) and Alphabet decided to ramp up spending to ease capacity shortages that have limited their ability to meet soaring AI services demand, even after several quarters of multi-billion-dollar outlays.

The results offer the clearest sign yet that AI is emerging as a primary growth engine, although the monetization journey is still in its early days, investors and analysts said.

The upbeat commentary also bodes well for [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) (AMZN.NaE), the largest U.S. cloud provider, which will report earnings on Thursday after markets close, and underscores how surging demand for the new technology is shielding the tech giants from tariff-driven economic uncertainty hobbling other sectors.

""As companies like Alphabet and Meta race to deliver on the promise of AI, capital expenditures are shockingly high and will remain elevated for the foreseeable future,"" said Debra Aho Williamson, founder and chief analyst at Sonata Insights.

But if their core businesses remain strong, ""it will buy them more time with investors and provide confidence that the billions being spent on infrastructure, talent and other tech-related expenses will be worthwhile,"" she added.

Microsoft (MSFT.NaE) shares rose about 9% in premarket trading on Thursday, putting the Windows maker on track to cross $4 trillion in market value - a milestone only chip giant Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) has reached so far.

Meta was up even more, rising 11.5% and on course to add nearly $200 billion to its market value of $1.75 trillion. Amazon (AMZN.NaE) gained over 3%.

All the companies have faced intense scrutiny from investors over their ballooning capital expenditures, which were expected to total $330 billion this year before the latest earnings.

And until a few days ago, the Magnificent Seven stocks were also trailing the S&amp;P 500 in year-to-date performance.

SILENCING DOUBTS

Microsoft (MSFT.NaE) said on Wednesday it would spend a record $30 billion in the current quarter, after better-than-expected sales and an above-estimate forecast for its Azure cloud computing business showcased the growing returns on its massive AI bets.

The prediction puts Microsoft (MSFT.NaE) on track to potentially outspend its rivals over the next year. It came after Google-parent Alphabet beat revenue expectations and raised its spending forecast by $10 billion to $85 billion for the year.

Microsoft (MSFT.NaE) also disclosed for the first time the dollar figure for Azure sales and the number of users for its Copilot AI tools, whose adoption has long been a concern for investors.

It said Azure generated more than $75 billion in sales in its last fiscal year, while Copilot tools had over 100 million users. Overall, around 800 million customers use AI tools peppered across Microsoft's (MSFT.NaE) sprawling software empire.

""It's the kind of result that quickly silences any doubts about cloud or AI demand,"" said Josh Gilbert, market analyst at eToro. ""Microsoft (MSFT.NaE) is more than justifying its spending.""

Other AI companies have also attracted a clutch of users.

Alphabet said last week its Gemini AI assistant app has more than 450 million monthly active users. OpenAI's ChatGPT, the application credited with kicking off the generative AI frenzy, has around 500 million weekly active users.

Meta, meanwhile, raised the bottom end of its annual capital expenditure forecast by $2 billion, to a range of between $66 billion and $72 billion. It also said that costs driven by its efforts to catch up in Silicon Valley's intensifying AI race would push 2026 expense growth rate above 2025's pace.

Better-than-expected sales growth in the April-June period and an above-estimate revenue forecast for the current quarter, however, assured investors that strength in the social media giant's core advertising business can support the massive outlays.

2025-07-30 01:41:39,r/stocks,Is Oklo/SMR/TerraPower the next NVDA/AMD/Intel?,"
Ok so here’s how I’m seeing it.
Everyone’s focused on $NVDA, $AMD, $INTC, but they’re just one piece of the whole puzzle. Here’s how I see it: AI needs constant computational and electrical power. Not just for the data centers and the fabs that make the chips, but the chips themselves burn power 24/7. The more models scale, the more energy they eat. That power has to come from somewhere. Big tech ceos are already talking about potential future power shortages if we dont come up with something better than what we have rn
So here’s how I’m thinking about it:
We started with AI companies throwing money at chip companies →chip companies throwing money at fabs like TSMC →fabs and AI centers pulling insane amounts of power off the grid →and now we’re about to see power companies (especially nuclear) get flooded with cash →and that means the uranium miners feeding those reactors are next in line.
This is how i see the chain:
AI companies → NVDA / AMD / INTC → TSMC / Samsung → SMRs like Oklo / SMR / TerraPower → uranium miners like UUUU / NXE / CCJ.
Every stage up the chain got paid. The last ones left to run are nuclear and uranium.
I think we’re about to see a repeat of the same pattern within the next few years as we experience energy shortage. Just like how NVDA and AMD dominated chips, I think a couple players will dominate nuclear. Right now we’ve got:
* Oklo (backed by Sam Altman, just IPO’d $10.5B)
* NuScale / SMR (~$6.8B)
* TerraPower (still private but Gates-backed and getting a ton of attention)
That’s probably the big 3. Others will show up, but like everything else, a couple names are going to take 80% of the market and leave everyone else behind.
Same goes for uranium. CCJ is the king, but NXE and UUUU are getting attention. Supply is tight, and if nuclear demand explodes, miners get squeezed upward just like GPU demand squeezed NVDA.
So yeah, are Oklo / SMR / TerraPower are the next NVDA / AMD / INTC  just further up the chain? The ones getting paid by the ones getting paid.
I’m looking at LEAP calls and they are not that expensive while they’re still under the radar. It’s the last piece of the AI/infrastructure puzzle that hasn’t run yet.
What do you guys think? Am I early? I just dropped a few grand on $UUUU and OKLO july 2026 calls so Im seaking guidance from fellow degenerates. Also I know were still years ahead of nuclear, but I have a big FOMO…",3,Brilliant-Repeat-178,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mcranr/is_oklosmrterrapower_the_next_nvdaamdintel/,1mcranr

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says he’s created more billionaires than any CEO in the world: ‘Don’t feel sad for anybody at my layer’

The tech executive is worth $151 billion, and Nvidia’s unique employee stock option allows staffers to reap the gains of the $4 trillion semiconductor company.

picture alliance / Getty Images

	•	Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is worth $151 billion—and he’s bringing his team along to the billionaires club with him. The AI boss said that he’s minted more billionaires on his management team than “any CEO in the world.” The culture at Nvidia is intense, but by shelling out for staffers, Huang reasons: “You take care of people, everything else takes care of itself.”

Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang has amassed a $151 billion net worth thanks to the success of his $4 trillion semiconductor company. And the ninth-richest person in the world says he’s bringing his team into the exclusive billionaires club thanks to Nvidia’s envy-inducing compensation packages. 

“I’ve created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world,” Huang said recently during a panel hosted by venture capitalists running the All-In podcast. “They’re doing just fine.”

Tech leaders at Meta, OpenAI, and Google are now also shelling out to attract top AI experts—with Meta even attempting to poach OpenAI employees with $100 million signing bonuses, according to leader Sam Altman. With the AI race being so hot, chief executives are reaping billion-dollar net-worth gains from their company’s rising stock valuation, raising the question of whether their staffers are getting in on the pot of gold too. But Huang asserts that his employees are well-rewarded for Nvidia’s success.

“Don’t feel sad for anybody at my layer,” Huang said. “My layer is doing just fine.”

In fact, Huang noted that he personally reviews all employee compensation to ensure staffers’ wallets are stuffed. While he said the rumor that he has a stash of stock options on deck “is nuts,” he does confirm that he bumps wages every year to keep Nvidia workers happy. 

“I review everybody’s compensation up to this day,” Huang said. “I sort through all 42,000 employees, and 100% of the time I increase the company’s spend on \[operating expenses\]. And the reason for that is because you take care of people, everything else takes care of itself.”

Nvidia declined Fortune’s request for comment. 

Huang loves a small, well-paid team of AI geniuses—and ‘tortures’ them into greatness

Nvidia employs tens of thousands of people, but having a small, nimble, well-funded AI team may be the ticket to the top. Huang emphasized that DeepSeek and Moonshot AI both have relatively slim AI crews, yet have catapulted to great business success. 

“One hundred fifty or so AI researchers can probably, with enough funding behind them, create an OpenAI,” Huang said during the panel. “OpenAI was about 150 people, \[as well as\] Deepmind. They’re all about that size. There’s something about the elegance of small teams.”

Once talent manages to get onto the lean-and-mean AI team at Nvidia, they have to reckon with Huang’s cutthroat culture. Current and former staffers have described an “always-on” expectation, with one ex-employee saying she attended seven to 10 meetings every day, where fighting and shouting was common. The CEO’s grindset has clearly bled into the way staffers approach their work, and Huang’s leadership strategy entails pushing workers to the brink. But he isn’t willing to give up and fire people if they can’t do the job at hand, because he always thinks “they could improve.” 

“I’d rather torture you into greatness because I believe in you,” Huang said during a fireside chat with Stripe CEO Patrick Collison last year. While the CEO said he was being tongue-in-cheek, he doubled down: “I think coaches that really believe in their team torture them into greatness.”

And there’s an upside for working long hours and sitting through tense meetings: Nvidia employees get special compensation perks. The tech company allows employees to contribute up to 15% of their salaries to buy up company shares at a 15% discount. One mid-level employee even reportedly bought in for 18 years and retired with shares worth $62 million. It’s a deal that’s so lucrative that it’s become “golden handcuffs” for many staffers who can’t bear the thought of losing the perk. In 2023, Nvidia had a 2.7% turnover rate, compared to 17.7% in the semiconductor industry at large. 

As Huang said in an interview with 60 Minutes last year: “If you want to do extraordinary things, it shouldn’t be easy.”

2025-07-29 20:52:40,r/NVDA_Stock,"I came across this interesting read on X titled ""What is CoWoP? A True Leap in Packaging- WallstCN."" As usual, it seems Nvidia is steps ahead in evolving for the future of accelerated computing.","Suddenly, this new technology roadmap started getting hyped this morning... Members of our private group are all lamenting... there's just too much to learn every day.

I studied it with a few friends, and here are some simple summaries. None of us are technical experts; we're just a few amateurs analyzing a picture together. Please feel free to criticize any mistakes.

1. Is this CoWoP roadmap reliable?

It seems quite reliable. The gentleman in the top-right corner, Anand Mannargudi, is a technical staff member at NVIDIA and has been with the company for 12 years. Citing a contributor on an internal technical PowerPoint slide is a very credible detail.

2. How did this gain traction?- 

Some people had already seen this over the weekend and before the market opened on Monday. However, it gained intense traction today, with a slew of domestic sell-side analysts publishing their interpretations and many memes circulating, which we won't repeat here. But after searching extensively, I found no related ""study materials"" from overseas sources. There was nothing from overseas sell-side analysts, and we spent a long time Browse IEEE without finding any highly relevant papers. A leading PCB manufacturer also held small meetings last week and this afternoon, which was likely one of the triggers.

3. How to understand this roadmap in a ""non-professional"" way? Let's first look at what has changed.

Compared to the traditional CoWoS (though called traditional, it's already a very advanced packaging technology), three things are gone: the entire ""package substrate + BGA balls"" has been eliminated. The ""bare die module"" with the silicon interposer is now directly soldered onto the server motherboard.

4. In simple terms, you can think of the current AI chip as a ""Lego block"" assembly.

This structure is built up layer by layer with the following components:

* Chip (Die): The core computing unit, such as the GPU core and the adjacent HBM (High-Bandwidth Memory).
* Interposer: A high-precision silicon wafer that acts like an ""adapter board,"" allowing small chips like the GPU and HBM to be placed closely side-by-side for high-speed communication.
* Package Substrate: The assembly of the interposer and chips needs to be mounted on a larger ""base,"" which is the package substrate. It is responsible for translating the thousands of tiny signal points on the chip into larger solder balls for soldering onto the final circuit board.
* Platform PCB: This is the common server motherboard that ultimately carries everything.

The CoWoS structure (the left part of the diagram above) is already extremely advanced and is the standard for top-tier AI chips like the H100/H200. However, its drawback is having too many layers. Like constructing a building, the more floors there are, the longer the path for signals and power from the ground to the top floor, leading to greater losses and higher costs.

5. What's different about CoWoP this time?

The approach of CoWoP is very aggressive. Its core idea is to remove all unnecessary intermediate layers. It directly eliminates the expensive and thick intermediate ""Package Substrate"" and instead develops a technologically intensive ""Platform PCB"" that allows the ""chip + interposer"" assembly to be mounted directly onto this enhanced motherboard. 

Simply put, CoWoP = CoWoS - Package Substrate. 

This seemingly simple ""subtraction"" is a massive technological leap. It means the motherboard (PCB) itself must possess some of the high-precision routing capabilities previously provided by the package substrate.

6. Some technical pros and cons; this part is grayed out as it's quite dry, so feel free to read selectively. 

What are the advantages?

* Shorter interconnect paths: With one less organic substrate layer, signals go directly from the interposer to the motherboard's copper traces. This results in lower signal attenuation for NVLink / HBM, allowing for longer on-board interconnect distances.
* Improved Power Integrity (PI): On-board VRMs (Voltage Regulator Modules) can be placed closer to the GPU, reducing parasitic inductance and improving transient current response.
* Better thermal management: Eliminating the package lid allows for direct attachment of a cold plate or liquid cooling, which is crucial for GPUs exceeding 1000W.
* Reduced thermo-mechanical mismatch: Removing the organic substrate, which has the largest difference in CTE (Coefficient of Thermal Expansion), lowers the risk of warpage.
* Cost and Capacity: The organic substrate is a current bottleneck for AI servers. Removing it means eliminating an expensive and supply-constrained process step.

What are the disadvantages?

* Steeply increased motherboard manufacturing requirements: The line density, flatness, and tolerance must now meet the standards previously held by packaging foundries.
* High rework difficulty: Once a GPU die worth tens of thousands of dollars is soldered onto the motherboard, the yield/failure rate must be extremely low.
* Complex package-system co-design: Signal integrity, thermals, and stress must be simulated jointly by the chip, interposer, and PCB teams.

7/ What details should be noted?

First, the cost doesn't disappear; it shifts. While the expensive organic substrate (ABF Substrate) and traditional packaging steps are eliminated, the cost shifts to the higher technical requirements for the ""Platform PCB"" and the more complex ""Die-on-Board"" assembly process. This has significant implications for the value distribution in the supply chain. As standard PCBs become commoditized, ""more advanced"" PCBs could create a massive competitive moat; costs may shift from packaging to PCBs.

Second, this is a very aggressive roadmap. NVIDIA's previous generation technology already frequently faced issues with production capacity and yield. This new technological path could elevate these problems to another level. The ultimate goal is to reduce the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), including material costs, power consumption costs, and cooling costs. Although the direct costs of some环节 disappear, new costs and risks will emerge in other areas. NVIDIA is betting that, overall, the CoWoP solution will still win out in terms of performance and cost.

Third, it's likely that the two technologies will run in parallel. According to the diagram, for the mass production of the GR series, the two roadmaps may coexist. As the industry leader, NVIDIA would retain a mature solution as a ""safety net"" while the new technology is not yet 100% mature, ensuring its product iterations and market supply are not disrupted by technical risks.8/ For some industry players:

* For NVIDIA: It's about ""shifting the performance bottleneck from the chip process to the package/system-level interconnect."" Once they master this, other manufacturers will be left further behind. This elevates the competition from the ""chip dimension"" to the ""system dimension,"" using system engineering complexity to build a new competitive moat.
* For TSMC: ""The silicon interposer area will be larger, making TSMC's role even more indispensable."" In the CoWoP scheme, TSMC's role may even evolve from a ""partial participant"" in CoWoS to a ""more central system integration consultant"" because it holds the key silicon interposer technology.
* For ASIC &amp; Cloud Giants: While cloud giants may have the capital and scale to replicate this path, it is nearly impossible for AI chip startups to keep up with such a capital-intensive, ecosystem-heavy, system-level innovation. NVIDIA is expanding the battlefield from ""chip design"" to ""system integration.""
* For HBM: ""It's the inevitable choice for HBM4/5."" As the number of stacked layers and I/O counts in HBM continues to increase, the demands on power delivery and signal paths are becoming increasingly stringent, and traditional packaging methods will soon hit their physical limits. CoWoP is designed precisely to solve the challenges of next-generation memory interconnection.

9. From a broader narrative perspective: NVIDIA is attempting to transform the server motherboard into the ""final packaging layer"" for its GPU, thereby defining the entire AI computing hardware platform. NVIDIA is no longer just ""selling chips""; it is defining an entire system-level platform of ""chip + package + motherboard.""

If they succeed, it will trigger a value restructuring and technological reshuffle across the entire downstream semiconductor supply chain (packaging, substrates, PCBs, server ODMs).

This is a necessary step on the path to the ""Exascale"" computing era. Without such packaging and integration technology, advances in chip manufacturing processes alone can no longer meet the explosive growth demand for AI computing power.

2025-07-29 13:13:44,r/NVDA_Stock,"NVDA - Many are probably under appreciating just how big the h20 reopening is for them. Here's my analysis, referencing Jefferies research and Bernstein's research to corroborate my view.","AMD yesterday raised the price of their MI350 chips, from $10K to $25K as they look to challenge NVIDIA. HSBC claims yesterday that they believe AMD can genuinely compete with NVIDIA's Blackwell Chips, as they lifted AMD's 2025 AI revenue forecast from $9.6B to $15.1B. 

For that reason, coupled with the strength of AMD's price action, AMD does still look interesting but I think that many forget just how much of a beast Nvidia is. And actually, just how significant this H20 news that Trump announced last week is. 

Jeffries for instance, said in an analyst note that Nvidia's H20 chip supply will not be able to match China's soaring demand. 

They argued that Nvidia’s H20 AI chip stockpile (600K–900K units) falls short of China’s demand, which could hit 1.8M units, following a temporary easing of U.S. export restrictions.Despite supply limits, Chinese firms prefer Nvidia chips due to its CUDA ecosystem, superior performance, and limited local alternatives.

So whilst there are alternative chips, the Chinese generally favour Nvidia's chips. With China's AI capex forecasted to be $108B, there is absolutely no signs of AI demand cooling in China, and this is a MASSIVE tailwind for Nvidia that they once again have access to. 

And we have clear signs of just how big this ramp in H20 production will be now with the China market reopened. Just today, nvidia ordered 300,000 H20 chips from TSM, adding 600k-700k in inventory. 

Bernstein is expecting that Nvidia will hold 54% of the China market after their H20 approval.

The next biggest, Huawei will have just 28%. For comparison and context, they expect that AMD will hold just 4% of the Chinese market. 

So nvidia is absolutely the leader here. and I think many do forget just how big of a deal the H20 to China resumption is. 

Breakout to new highs.

2025-07-27 13:52:18,r/NVDA_Stock,What I found fascinating while r me eading Jensen Huang’s biography,"I read Jensen Huang's biograph lately and I found some interesting stories in it. I wanted to share with you. 


1.When Jensen Huang immigrated to the U.S. as a kid, he ended up in a small rural town and got bullied pretty badly. But instead of reacting with defiance or lashing out, he just smiled and brushed it off. Calm and quiet resilience.

He later said he got into physical training thanks to a roommate, and he started doing tons of push-ups. Eventually, his build changed and that might’ve naturally put an end to the bullying.
	
2.He was really good at table tennis. He seriously considered going pro during his school years. Even after founding NVIDIA, he kept a ping pong table in the office, tucked away in the corner.

3.He’s always been this upbeat, warm-hearted kind of guy. He didn’t like cutting people loose. That’s why NVIDIA’s hiring process was notoriously tough. His philosophy was that if you hire carefully, you won’t need to fire.

At a public meeting one day, he pressed a junior employee, asking, “What value are you delivering here at NVIDIA compared to what you’re paid?” The guy was crushed by it. But later, when that same employee was diagnosed with a rare illness, Jensen tried to cover his treatment personally from his own pocket.

4.He wasn’t like this back in his AMD days, but once he became a CEO, “Hwaung's rage” became a thing. Not in a toxic but more like explosive passion when he disagrees with something. People say that ""If you’ve experienced his rage, you’ve become part of the inner circle at NVIDIA""

5.Around 2014(I don't remember exactly) a junior engineer who was lazy but quite creative noticed a potential link between deep learning and NVIDIA chips. Despite having a relatively low performance record, the guy went straight to Jensen and pitched his idea with everything he had. Maybe he figured he had nothing to lose.

Jensen listened. Then he ripped the roadmap off the wall and declared, “This is our future.”
From that moment on, NVIDIA bet everything on AI. CUDA became the heart of their strategy, and they poured everything into developing GPUs optimized for machine learning.

2025-07-26 18:29:49,r/NVDA_Stock,China's demand for repairs to U.S. banned Nvidia AI chips surges,"China is seeing a surge in demand for a business that theoretically shouldn't exist: repairing Nvidia's advanced artificial intelligence chipsets that the U.S. has banned from being exported to its trade and technology rivals, Reuters reported on Friday.

About a dozen boutique firms now specialize in repairing Nvidia's H100 GPUs, chips that somehow made it into China despite the restrictions, according to two firms in Shenzhen, China's tech hub.

The co-owner of a company that has been working on fixing Nvidia's gaming GPUs for 15 years and started working on AI chips at the end of 2024 said, “The demand for repairs is really high.”

The report says that business has been so good that the owners have set up a new company to handle these orders, which can now repair up to 500 Nvidia AI chips per month.

2025-07-23 17:47:22,r/NVDA_Stock,"All the products the US makes are the president's to make deals with apparently, including Nvidia's chips and software.","The Trump administration released a new artificial intelligence blueprint on Wednesday that aims to deregulate the industry and makes it easier and less risky for U.S. companies to export their technologies to foreign countries. President Donald Trump will mark the plan's release with a speech outlining the importance of winning an AI race that is increasingly seen as a defining feature of 21st-century geopolitics, with both China and the United States investing heavily in the industry to secure economic and military superiority. The plan, which includes some 90 recommendations, calls for the export of U.S. AI technology abroad and a crackdown on state laws deemed too restrictive to let it flourish, a marked departure from predecessor Joe Biden's ""high fence"" approach that limited global access to coveted AI chips.

The administration said it plans to partner with the AI industry to create export packages of chips and software for America's friends and allies.

**""We're establishing a program led by the departments of Commerce and State to partner with industry to deliver secure full-stack AI export packages, including hardware models, software applications and standards to America's friends and allies around the world,"" said Michael Kratsios, head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.**

Trump will incorporate some of the plan's recommendations into executive orders that will be signed ahead of his speech, according to two sources familiar with the plans. Trump directed his administration in January to develop the plan.

Top administration officials such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House National Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett are also expected to join the event titled ""Winning the AI Race,"" organized by White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks and his co-hosts on the ""All-In"" podcast, according to an event schedule reviewed by Reuters.

The event will be hosted by the Hill and Valley Forum, an informal supper club whose deep-pocketed members helped propel Trump's campaign and sketched out a road map for his AI policy long before he was elected. Trump is expected to take additional actions in the upcoming weeks that will help Big Tech secure the vast amounts of electricity it needs to power the energy-guzzling data centers needed for the rapid expansion of AI, Reuters previously reported.

     Ok, forgot to add positions. And got nuked - apologies Admin!

      I personally hold Nvda, AMD, Broadcom, ASML, and SOXL (so most semis)



So after NXP’s somewhat negative earnings report; I was very interested in what TI would report.   Their report was great IMO; all areas, except automotive, have been recovering well; so I think that was NXPs weakness as well.

Their stock sold off after hours and got worse (down almost 12% as I type this) - CNBC reported some negativity (Deidre Bosa); which I DID NOT hear all of it but can’t find a replay; but did hear Guy Adami was talking about TI (on fast money) and said they had weakness in their “power control systems” - and alluded to this impacting the nVIDIA need for power chips (lower need) which puts negative spin on the AI trade and all semiconductors.  I think this falls into either industrial, enterprise or analog control and they (TXN) pointed out it grew high double digits (18%) - and at the end of the call even said their data center segment was growing about 50% !

I’ve listened to the conference call live and replay and I can’t find this - but noted the whole Semi group is now trading lower in after hours.

Did anyone else listen and hear anything related to power semiconductors being down?   Did I miss it?

Is CNBC just trying to drive down the sector or just erroneously reporting?   They sometimes can spew stuff that really can turn markets, especially some of the retail groups that trust everything they say….

2025-07-21 01:09:34,r/stocks,AI Action Day This Wednesday,"I posted a couple days ago expressing my view that money can be made by being on top of trump's agenda, policy-related news, etc. I'm not saying its easy, but I think in several instances so far this year, the ""puzzle pieces"" have been out there, and if you put them together, you could have positioned ahead of the news. MP was one i mentioned in my previous post but there have been others.

To get to the point... There is an ""AI Action Day"" event happening on Wednesday. Hosted by All-In podcast people (David Sachs) and with various tech leaders in attendance as well as Trump of course.  Supposedly this will be an announcement of a larger strategy to promote US AI dominance. I would bet that there are opportunities here. Not clear if there is a home run, but I think a smart person could figure out a smart way to play this.

Unfortunately, I'm not a smart person, but maybe collectively as a group of not-smart people, we can figure out some plays here.

I can't link sources for some reason, keeps deleting my post, but you guys can google more information regarding the event if you want. TLDR It's being hosted

Technology leaders participating in the event include **Chris Power, CEO of Hadrian**; **Shyam Sankar, CTO of Palantir**; **Paul Buchheit, Partner at YCombinator; James Litinsky, CEO of MP Materials; Lisa Su, CEO of AMD.**

Additional speakers are still being confirmed.

I don't think the obvious choices are going to move much here. NVDA is already up significantly and i don't expect any announcements big enough to move a 4 trillion market cap... The easing of chip restrictions is also already priced in now. I expected this will be touched on at the event, but it's no longer news.

Spitballing but a few ideas:

I think energy will be a major focus of any strategy announcement. This is an area that is critically important for AI, and an area where the US is SIGNIFICANTLY lagging China. I'm not too sure how this could be played, but I'm considering EQT. I was looking at them last week due to the PA AI event. The stock didn't move much unfortunately, but all of nat gas seems to have struggled to close the week for whatever reason. By no means an expert here, but EQT has a major grift angle in that their CEO is closely tied to the republican party/trump.

Datacenter buildout: PWR, ACM, FLR - not really sure here. Chatgpt helped me on this one. Maybe APLD? Could be some type of policy/tax incentive to stimulate datacenter construction. not that its really needed at this point...

I'm really just spitballing and hoping to start some conversation here.",9,Difficult-Quarter-48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1m52zbb/ai_action_day_this_wednesday/,1m52zbb
2025-07-20 18:29:44,r/stocks,Nvidia Will Continue Controlling The AI Board,"Nvidia is the 'queen' of the AI ecosystem, dominating hardware, software, and systems and controlling key segments from training to inference and networking.

Unmatched AI leadership, explosive revenue growth, and strategic partnerships with players like Astera Labs, Credo, and Super Micro Computer reinforce Nvidia's central role.

China market access and the Omniverse platform provide significant new growth drivers, supporting a strong 12-24 month growth outlook and a buy rating.

Despite high absolute valuation multiples, Nvidia's rapid growth and favorable PEG ratios make it attractive versus peers; the main risk is US-China geopolitical tension.

I believe these companies are well-positioned in the AI ecosystem, but I realise that one piece is missing: the queen. Just like in a game of chess, the queen is the most powerful and versatile piece on the board. It can move in any direction (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and quickly cover a wide area. That is why I believe it is a perfect fit for NVIDIA (NVDA). I say this because it dominates both offensively and defensively. Just as the queen controls most of the board, NVDA controls the most valuable parts of the AI infrastructure, from training to inference, simulation, and networking. Secondly, it is versatile and critical because it spans hardware, software, and systems. This is cool because few participants can match its breadth and influence. Finally, it leverages strategic partnerships. I mean, just as the queen commands pawns, rooks, and bishops, NVDA integrates system builders (such as Super Micro Computer (SMCI)), connectivity providers (such as Credo Technology Group (CRDO) and Astera Labs (ALAB)), and government AI programmes to expand its control over the AI battlefield.

So why is the queen so special?

Well, several factors set Nvidia apart. First and foremost, it holds an unparalleled leadership position in the AI field, thanks to the combination of hardware, software, and ecosystem advantages. Its Blackwell GPU architecture makes it uniquely special. Combined with the Omniverse simulation platform, we are driving self-reinforcing AI, which is driving explosive growth. For example, in the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year, NVDA achieved revenue of $44.1 billion, representing a year over year increase of 69%. Data centre revenue reached $39.1 billion, up 73%. Some of Nvidia's key customers such as Microsoft , Google  OpenAI, and Meta  deploy tens of thousands of Nvidia's latest GPUs each quarter. For example, according to SA Weebler Finance data, hyperscale data centre operators are running approximately 1,000 NVLink rack systems (about 72,000 GPUs) per week, with further increases expected. Ideally, this means Nvidia's data centre run rate in the AI computing sector has exceeded $170 billion annually.

Secondly, NVDA's stack is also expanding beyond GPUs. As I mentioned, its global industrial simulation platform is now being used to digitise entire factories and cities. In fact, the platform has evolved to support critical infrastructure. Original equipment manufacturers like BMW are running over 30 virtual factories on the platform to optimise production in advance. As each AI solution requires an increasing amount of synthetic training data, NVDA's end-to-end solutions form an unparalleled moat. Ideally, this platform means more users generating more simulation data, ultimately driving demand for more Nvidia computing resources. What I see is that NVDA is now at the centre of the AI value chain.

Finally, the U.S. has approved the resumption of exports of NVIDIA H20 AI GPUs to China. This means NVIDIA will be able to access China's potential market, which is significant. According to a Morgan Stanley report, China's AI market is expected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2030.

China has been systematically implementing a long-term strategy to build its domestic artificial intelligence capabilities. Its strong academic foundation, innovative methods, data, talent, and growing foreign investment are driving it toward becoming a leading artificial intelligence powerhouse...

‘...China is less concerned with building the most powerful AI capabilities and more focused on bringing AI to market. China embraces open-source AI, while the United States appears to be moving toward closed, tightly controlled AI systems...’

‘...The next 6 to 12 months will be a critical period for Chinese AI companies, as more and more deployments aimed at solving real-world problems begin to demonstrate productivity gains.’

Due to this milestone, NVDA's Jensen Huang estimates that NVDA's potential market size  in China will reach $50 billion. This means that China's spending on AI will increase, and Nvidia's growth prospects are expected to be stronger than ever before. I expect this growth outlook to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly earnings report to be released on 27 August 2025.

These factors combined will undoubtedly accelerate Nvidia's growth trajectory over the next 12 to 24 months. Therefore, I assign a ‘Buy’ rating to Nvidia Corporation.

Nvidia's AI Ecosystem

Having highlighted the case for NVDA, I would like to connect it to some AI components I have researched previously. Some of these AI companies have remarkable growth prospects and are expected to align their growth trajectories with NVDA. Additionally, the connections between NVDA and these AI companies will help us better understand NVDA's future direction.

First, Astera Labs  is a leading connectivity chip company that recently went public in 2024. ALAB's chips support scalable and low-latency GPU rack interconnects. For more information on Astera Labs and its chips, please refer to Article 1 and Article 2. Now, Nvidia has publicly announced its collaboration with Astera on NVLink Fusion. This collaboration expands NVDA's total addressable market (TAM).

There is also Credo Technology, which is known for its active cables  re-timers, and SerDes chips. According to SA Oakoff Investments, most hyperscale computing vendors now consider CRDO's AEC to be the de facto standard for in-rack links. This means that AEC cables are the infrastructure required for NVDA's 72-GPU Blackwell rack.

Third, Super Micro Computer  and Celestica  manufacture and sell GPU racks and systems using NVDA technology. Nvidia currently provides complete data centre racks containing tens of thousands of GPUs, which are delivered to system builders like SMCI and CLS. They then collaborate with NVDA to package and sell these racks to hyperscale customers such as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. For more information, please refer to this article from SMCI and this article from Celestica.

In summary, these partnerships demonstrate NVIDIA's connectivity within the AI ecosystem. This confirms that NVIDIA is indeed the queen of the AI chessboard.

For a company with a market capitalisation of 4.22 trillion dollars, it still has significant growth opportunities, particularly in the Chinese market, which means there is much to watch for with NVIDIA. Additionally, I note that NVIDIA has an A- growth rating, as shown in the figure below. The company's expected revenue growth rate is 60.71%, while the industry median is 7.28%. Furthermore, its 3-5 year compound annual growth rate  for expected long-term earnings per share  growth is 29.09%, compared to the industry median of 14.29%. This clearly indicates the expected growth levels for certain potential AI opportunities, such as the Omniverse platform and the Chinese AI market.

Now, when it comes to valuation, the growth outlook is becoming clearer. First, when I look at the chart below, I notice that most metrics are above the industry median, indicating that the valuation is higher than the industry median. Its non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio is 40.12 times, and its forward enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is 34.79 times, both significantly higher than the industry median. However, when I look at the non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio , it indicates that the valuation is undervalued by 27%. NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio is 1.38 times, while the industry median is 1.90 times. Based on the GAAP trailing 12-month PEG, the company's P/E ratio is 0.69 times, undervalued by 31% compared to the industry median. Ideally, I would say that most multiples look high in absolute terms, but compared to NVDA's 60.71% compound annual growth rate, the stock's valuation isn't as high as it appears.

In terms of peer comparison, I chose NVDA's closest competitors because Nvidia is already far ahead in terms of market capitalisation, so I chose Broadcom and AMD. I noticed that NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio and expected price-to-earnings ratio are still lower than its peers.

I believe that the biggest risk facing NVIDIA at present is geopolitical risk. Currently, there are many uncertainties between China and the United States, especially following the imposition of tariffs on Liberation Day and the U.S. government's decision to suspend exports of H20 GPUs to China. Such situations could recur and undermine NVIDIA's growth plans and market expansion efforts. Losing the Chinese market would have a significant impact on NVIDIA's business. Additionally, geopolitical events such as trade tariffs and sanctions could affect global supply or cloud computing spending in some of the key regions where NVIDIA operates. In conclusion, in this grand AI infrastructure game, NVIDIA is the queen. Currently, it is the most powerful and flexible piece on the board. Compared to peers that may occupy other key positions, NVIDIA controls every direction. For example, AMD is the rook, SMCI is the bishop, while Credo and Astera are agile knights. Ultimately, NVIDIA determines the pace and scope of this game. As AI demand continues to grow, NVIDIA's dominant position is further strengthened by the expansion of the Chinese market.",45,Aluseda,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1m4t8er/nvidia_will_continue_controlling_the_ai_board/,1m4t8er

&gt; Nvidia (NVDA) is set to recoup billions of dollars in revenue if the tech giant resumes sales of its AI chips to China as expected after a surprise export ban in April.

&gt; Wall Street analysts at Stifel, Bernstein, and William Blair said Nvidia could make up as much as $15 billion in revenue from China in the second half of the year to hit around $20 billion from the region for its 2026 fiscal year, which ends next January. That would be an uptick from its roughly $17 billion in sales from China in 2025.

&gt; Nvidia said Tuesday that it had received assurances from the Trump administration that it would be granted licenses to resume sales of its H20 chips to Chinese customers, sending the stock to a new record high.

&gt; Stifel analyst Ruben Roy raised his price target on Nvidia to $202 from $180 following the news, writing in a note to clients Tuesday that, given pent-up demand, there will ""likely be an accelerated cadence of H20 ingestion from China customers"" in the second half of the year.",454,joe4942,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1m29h0v/nvidia_could_recoup_as_much_as_15_billion_in/,1m29h0v

2025-07-17 14:53:00,r/stocks,Wall Street steady again after Trump downplays threat to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's job,"Wall Street appears calm after President Donald Trump walked back his earlier threats to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

Futures for the S&amp;P 500 were unchanged before the opening bell Thursday, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2%. Nasdaq futures rose less than 0.1%, essentially flat.

Trump has harshly criticized Powell and his Fed colleagues for the decision to stand pat on interest rates at a time when the economy is broadly healthy and unemployment is low. Trump's new complaint about Powell  which he says could be grounds for firing the central bank chief  is about cost overruns on the $2.5 billion renovation project at the Fed's Washington headquarters.

Wall Street loves lower rates because they goose prices higher for stocks and other investments, and Trump himself has been clamoring for the Fed to cut more quickly. But Powell has insisted he wants to wait for more data about how Trump’s stiff tariffs will affect the economy and inflation.

Markets, as well as the dollar, took a quick dive Wednesday on reports that Trump was talking about terminating Powell, but largely recovered after he appeared to walk back those sentiments.

A number of companies early in the earnings season have been reporting strong performances, even as they cite uncertainty about the near future due to the potential impacts of Trump's tariffs.

PepsiCo shares rose 2% before the bell Thursday after the beverage and snack giant's second-quarter sales and profit topped Wall Street projections. PepsiCo reaffirmed its April guidance, which projected lower full-year profit than previous forecasts due to increased costs from tariffs and a pullback in consumer spending.

The world’s largest chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), reported huge increases in sales and profit from a year ago, sending its stock up 3.4% in early trading. However, TSMC, a major supplier for Nvidia (NVDA), warned that “uncertainties and risks from the potential impact from tariff policies exist.”

Shares of United Airlines (UAL), which reported after the bell Wednesday, dipped 1.6% overnight after the carrier's second-quarter revenue came in a touch lower than expected. United also cut its full-year profit guidance.

Also falling early Thursday are shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) and Ingredion, makers of high fructose corn syrup. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that Coca-Cola has agreed to use real cane sugar in its flagship soft drink in the U.S. at his suggestion  though the company has yet to confirm that.

Ingredion tumbled almost 6% early Thursday, and Archer-Daniels-Midland fell 3%.

Analyst Full Comment: 

  
""We leave our est. unchanged but raise PO to reflect incremental sales/EPS in a scenario analysis. We assume a quarterly range of China shipments (H20, Blackwell equivalent) based on an annual run-rate that was likely 1H heavy, and in some cases reflects risk of license timing and/or Chinese customers finding alternatives. So in case of NVDA we assume 2H’CY25 quarterly (H20) run-rate of $4-$6bn/q, which we expect to remain flat YoY in CY26E given continued restrictions of more performant products (such as Blackwell/Rubin) and increased local competition. Our assumptions imply China accounts for 14% of global AI accelerator TAM in CY25, reducing to 12% by CY26E, and likely closer to 5-10% over time consistent with Jensen’s view of $50bn China TAM over the next 2-3 years, and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) CEO comments that over time China could contribute only modestly to the $500bn+ in CY28 global TAM. Based on incremental sales and 53% net margin we estimate a 5%/7% pf-EPS accretion for FY26/27E (CY25/26E). For 2H’CY25E, NVDA could also utilize some of its prior written-off material for H20, boosting GM incremental to our assumption. We raise our PO to $220 PO based on 37x current $5.87 FY27/CY26E EPS (was 30x), though still within 25x-56x historical range.""",107,stocksavvy_ai,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1m0m77q/nvidia_nvda_bofa_securities_reiterates_buy_raises/,1m0m77q

After months of silence and billions in lost revenue, Nvidia just said it's applying to resume sales of its H20 AI chips in China. The US government apparently ""assured"" them that licenses will be granted  which, if true, is a massive shift from the strict bans we saw earlier this year. Shares are ripping in premarket

What’s wild is that this comes just weeks after Jensen Huang met with Trump. Now he's in Beijing for a media briefing. Coincidence? Maybe. But the timing feels... calculated

Also worth noting: AMD is jumping too, riding Nvidia’s coattails and signaling that it might get the same green light. So maybe Washington's stance on AI chips to China is softening a bit?

Of course, even if deliveries resume, it’s unlikely to impact Nvidia’s current quarter much  too little time left. But if they can get chips flowing in Q3 and Q4, that’s a whole different story

Nvidia was already on a tear after breaking that $4T milestone, and now this could add more fuel.

News: [US CPI Report For June](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-07-15/us-cpi-report-for-june?srnd=homepage-americas)

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)/AMD- NVDA/AMD is now allowed to sell its previously restricted H20/MI308 chips to China after gaining U.S. government approval. This reopens a major demand pipeline and removes a significant geopolitical overhang, boosting investor sentiment around long-term growth prospects. NVDA has hit ATH from this, I'm more interested in AMD today as a trade though just because it's run down compared to NVDA, but I'm interested in seeing if NVDA can break $170. The export clearance marks a shift in U.S. posture toward China and semiconductors and the AI race, suggesting trade tensions are entering a more flexible phase and all that money Jensen ""donated"" to Trump is paying off. This benefits high-end chipmakers, namely AMD/NVDA the most.

[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&amp;p=d)/KC/FXI/all Chinese stocks- The chip export announcement has been interpreted as Trump easing his stance on China, sparking a rally across most Chinese equities.

2025-07-14 16:11:37,r/NVDA_Stock,How to Lock in Profits without Closing the Position,"**Pt. 1 of Titled Write Up, Focused on 100 shares of NVDA. TLDR at bottom.**

After a brief but violent downturn in the US equities markets, the main indexes like the S&amp;P500 and Nasdaq100 have swiftly returned to record highs. Investors were spooked by the current administration’s aggressive tariff policy and feared a possible global trade war. Tech stocks were hit particularly hard, with stocks like NVDA and META falling over 40 and 30 percent, respectively, from their February peaks. 

Investors who were willing to weather short-term volatility and possibly worsening global trade conditions were rewarded, as most tech stocks have significantly rebounded from April lows (some bouncing harder than others).

On Monday, April 7th, trade and tariff fears were at peak levels, and NVDA opened the day’s trading session around $88 per share. Investors largely saw this as too cheap, and the surge to around $97 at close marked the beginning of the next wave higher for the stock.

On Monday, July 7th, NVDA opened for trading just shy of $160 per share, and by the end of the week, the company achieved $4T in Market Cap and closed a few cents under $165 per share.

Even without nailing the bottom, any shares purchased during this leg up are well into the green. Data from Webull indicates that traders holding NVDA have an average cost of about $124, and 99.49% of free float shares were purchased below the current price.

Considering that the average investor is up 33% on their position, and that almost any sale of shares would be for the seller’s profit, many people could be mulling closing their positions just to “lock in profits.”

This should never be the sole reason to sell a position, and this write-up will explain how to achieve that goal without closing out the position using NVDA as an example. It does not matter if the unrealized gain is held in shares or options; each position type still has multiple ways to reduce the potential for loss while maintaining a position in the company.

# Example 1 (Owning 100+ Shares @ $125):

Many investors who have been holding NVDA for a significant period have accumulated at least 100 shares of stock. In this example, an investor owns 100 shares of NVDA at an average price of $125 per share. They spent $12,500 for the shares, and at the time of writing, the shares are worth about $16,500. The shares are over 30% in the green, and with each additional 100 shares owned, the investor is holding another \~$4000 in unrealized gain.

Owning 100 shares of stock gives an investor access to derivatives such as options contracts, where contracts are allocated by lots of 100 shares. The terms “Derivative Securities” and “Options Contracts” can sound complex and difficult to understand, but are simpler than most realize, and their main purpose is to reduce risk for shareholders.

Passive investors might hear “call options” and immediately think of the GME phenomenon that was largely driven by retail traders buying these contracts and generating almost too good to be true returns when the stock experienced a short squeeze.

However, a derivative is just something whose value depends on the value of something else. In this case, the option contract’s value is derived from, or depends on, the underlying stock’s value. Instead of outright selling the shares for $16,500, realizing the gain and exiting the position, the investor can utilize options contracts to sell the obligation of giving up the shares, rather than selling the shares outright.

What this means in practice is that an investor who is willing to sell their shares at $165 can instead sell the $165 strike call option with an expiration date of nearly any Friday in the future. The $165 strike call that expires this upcoming Friday can be sold for about $280, while if the investor believes $165 might be a medium-term top for the stock, yet does not want to sell, they can collect $2900 for selling the $165 strike call expiring in about a year.

(Note: Options Premium, or money used trading an option, is denoted on a per share basis on a lot of 100 shares. “$2.8 premium” = $2.8 dollars per share times 100 shares = $280)

Consider a scenario in which the NVDA investor sells the $165 call option for this Friday and collects $280. The investor’s cost basis has dropped from $12,500 to $12,220, and they are now obligated to sell their shares at $165 on or before Friday.

If the stock continues its rally next week, the investor is forced to sell the shares at $165, which they were willing to do anyway. They collected $280 and received $16,500 for the sale of the shares, which nets a profit of $4280 after subtracting the $12,500 spent on the shares. In this situation, the investor simply received an extra $280 to sell their shares at a price they wanted

If the stock starts to pull back next week and is below $165 on Friday, the obligation to sell at $165 will not be worth anything since the option buyer could get their shares cheaper on the open market. In this situation, the investor collected $280 and was released from the obligation to sell their shares.

So where’s the downside? In the situation in which the stock rallies, the downside is that it is impossible to gain more than $4280 on the position. Even if NVDA went to $200 this week, the investor is obligated to sell their shares at $165, and will net the profit from the sale and the collected premium.

In the event the stock falls, selling the $165 call does not fully remove downside risk. If the stock closes the week at $160, the investor lost $5 per share yet only collected $2.8 per share in premium, meaning they saw a decrease in unrealized gain despite collecting $280 and being released of their obligation.

While the investor can sell the $165 call again, it is going to be worth less premium than the $2.8 collected before. This is because the stock is no longer trading around that price, and to collect that amount, the investor would need to consider selling the $160 strike call (similar to how they sold the $165 strike when the stock was worth $165).

Even with the price decrease, the investor could collect about another 100 dollars by selling the $165 call again. If the stock rallies back above $165, the investor will be forced to sell the shares, but will collect $280 and $100 using options contracts in addition to selling for their desired price. However, if the stock continues declining and drops by more than $1 during the week, the $100 in premium will not cover the loss from the shares. This is still beneficial to the investor as collecting that premium drops their cost basis from $12,500 to $12,120 ($125 to $121.2), helping offset the decline in share value and preserving gains from a recovery.

While it is generally not advised to choose a strike price below cost basis, the investor can choose any strike price and expiration date available on the options chain. There is currently someone willing to pay $50 for the right (and the seller’s obligation) to acquire the option seller’s shares at $175 by this Friday. The option buyer expects the share price to increase by over 6% by next week, and an investor with 100 shares can take that money in exchange for the obligation to give up the shares at $175 by Friday. If the stock moves above $175 this week, they will sell their shares and receive $17,500 along with the money from the option buyer. If the stock closes the week at $175.00 or lower, the obligation is worthless. Given that the share price is currently below $165, many people may find this an enticing offer.

However, investors might not want to manage the hassle of opening and closing these obligations each week, and frankly $280 is not “locking in profits” when spending $12,500. How does the investor really “lock” the profit in without selling the position? Near term, the only way to collect enough premium to secure the full $4000 profit is to sell deep ITM calls. This will likely result in the shares getting called away, so it does not accomplish part two of the goal. The two most important factors for an option’s price are time to expiry and the underlying stock price, so to keep the price constant ($165 call), the investor needs to utilize the value of time.

Consider the second scenario in which the investor collects $2900 by selling the aforementioned $165 call expiring in about one year.

The investor still owns 100 shares at an average cost of $125 per share. The investor has an unrealized gain of $4000 and is weary of a correction over the coming months, but they do not want to sell their shares as they believe the stock will rally again sometime in the future.

Instead of selling now and trying to time a pullback in share price that may never come, the investor decides to reduce their risk by collecting a large amount of premium in exchange for the obligation to sell their shares at their desired price. In this example, the investor collects $29.00 premium or $2900 and is now obligated to sell their shares at $165 any time within the next year.

Before going into the situation outcomes, it is important to note the full effect this option sale has on the stock position. Initially, the shares were acquired for $12,500 but the investor just received $2900 from the option contract sale. The Investor has now reduced their exposure from $12,500 to $9,600 which equates to an average cost of $96 per share. However, this also means the position will move differently than holding 100 shares.

When an investor owns 100 shares, a $1 move in the stock price will net a gain or loss of $100 on the position, which is intuitive. Adding an option contract into the mix complicates the movement for several reasons. The main reason is that the option contract has a delta between 0.00 and 1.00.

An option’s delta can tell an investor many things about that derivative, such as the probability that the option expires in the money and the amount of shares controlled. There are plenty of online resources to learn more about delta and option greeks, but for this article, the purpose of delta will be to illustrate effective control of shares.

While this might sound confusing, consider the 100 shares of stock. A share of stock is 0.01 delta, meaning 100 shares is 1.00 delta. Options that are deep in the money have a delta near 1.00 and signal that the option moves similarly to owning 100 shares (both equaling 1.00 delta).

So now, considering the $165 call expiring in one year, the delta is about 0.63. This means it moves similarly to owning 63 shares of stock. If an investor sells this option, that is the equivalent of shorting 63 shares. While the delta of a share is always equal to 0.01, and 100 shares will always be 1.00 delta, the delta of an options contract changes as the stock price changes. Since options delta describes how likely it is that the option expires in the money, a sharp decline in share price would reduce the likelihood of expiring above $165 and therefore decrease the delta and the options premium.

The investor’s position can now be summarized like this: The Investor has $9,600 of exposure and sees similar movement to owning 37 shares of stock. The investor is obligated to sell their shares for $16,500 at any point in the next year. If the option expires worthless, the investor keeps the premium and the shares, while if the option expires in the money, the shares will be sold for $16,500 and the investor keeps the $2900 from the option sale.

The same downsides mentioned earlier apply to this position. If NVDA continues its rocket-fueled rally over the next year, the investor has capped their gain to $6900 ($4000 from share sale and $2900 from option sale). It is worth noting that generating $6900 profit on $12,500 is over 50% gain, and it is also worth noting $6900 profit using this strategy is similar to selling 100 shares at $194.

If the stock starts to fall, the investor still has multiple choices available to them. Options can be bought and sold at any time until expiration, so if the value of the option drops significantly, the investor may want to use the $2900 originally collected to close out the obligation early, while still netting a gain on the option sale and reurchase. The investor is then back to only owning 100 shares, and can repeat the process. The investor can also choose to hold the option to expiry, where the only two outcomes are either a $6900 gain or a reduction in cost basis to $96/share.

Even though selling call options limits the amount of gain for the investor, it significantly reduces exposure to near-term corrections or sudden crashes like the markets saw earlier this year. Cautious investors sitting on sizable unrealized gains may want to consider using the sale of options to reduce exposure while markets are volatile and less certain. “Locking in profits” using options is a spectrum, and investors should consider their personal goals before participating in this strategy. Option holders have not been forgotten, as part 2 will explain how to achieve this same goal in a slightly different way. Thank you for reading this far.

Disclaimer: Options are not suitable for all investors, may not be available in all accounts, and should not be used as anything other than a tool to reduce risk. I am not a Financial Advisor, and this is not financial advice.

**TLDR: Locking in profit is a spectrum, use covered calls to reduce exposure and collect premium based on personal objectives**

2025-07-12 07:35:55,r/stocks,Lump sump vs swing trading over years for growth stock,"I thought it would be smart to learn swing trading by analyzing technical chart (MACross, MACD lines), it looks good in short trend but in long trend, it seems it cannot beat just put all money (lump sump) in the beginning and forget about it.

  
For example: assume I invested  $10 000 to NVDA stock in beginning of 2020, after 5 years, it gained 1,473.66% which means I would have $147 366 now.

This allin method has advantages:

\- Much bigger gain than swing trading? I have this conception but it is good if some swing traders can confirm that.

\- No tax paid over years (big gains!) compared to swing tradings which I would need to pay tax (in EU) from capital gain

I’ve been diving into the em","Humanoid robots robots that can walk, manipulate objects, interact with humans have been stuck in sci-fi and R&amp;D labs for decades. That’s rapidly changing:**Tesla Optimus** is already performing warehouse tasks**China’s UBTech** delivered &gt;1,000 units to factories**Xpeng** and **Agility Robotics** are testing models for last-mile delivery**Nvidia**, **Intel**, and **AMD** are providing the “brains” with robotics-grade AI chips**Fanuc**, **ABB**, and others are improving small-scale actuators and motors

# Market ProjectionsGoldman Sachs: humanoid robots could become a $154B market by 2035Morgan Stanley: the market could scale to $5 trillion by 2050 (if penetration reaches 10% of global workforce tasks)

These are obviously fa  off projections, but here’s what’s compelling: the **entire robotics supply chain** chips, motors, sensors, material input (e.g. rare earths), and software is already public and investable.

# One ETF That Caught My Eye: KOID (KraneShares Humanoid &amp; Embodied AI ETF)

I don’t own it (yet), but I’ve been tracking KOID closely. It's the first ETF I’ve seen that is **dedicated entirely to the humanoid and embodied AI ecosystem**. What's unique

2025-07-11 15:23:58,r/stocks,Trump posted: ‘The stock market is at an all-time high and interest rates should be cut immediately’!,"Former U.S. President Donald Trump just posted heavy rhetoric on social media, praising tech, industrial stocks and cryptocurrencies for their big gains and strongly calling on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Let's break down what he said and analyze the current state of the market with the latest data. Tech stocks, industrial stocks, Nasdaq hit record highs, cryptocurrencies “break through the sky” Nvidia (NVDA) is up 47% since the tariffs, the U.S. made hundreds of billions of dollars from the tariffs the country came back and called on the Fed to immediately cut interest rates declaring that “there is no inflation” .

How does the market interpret this?

Expectations for rate cuts are heating up: inflation is falling back + political heat is rising in a campaign year, Trump's statement may create some public pressure on the Fed (although its independence remains).

Tariffs negative turned positive? : Despite initial concerns that the market was under pressure, from the perspective of capital rotation, industrial, AI and defense stocks have risen, and it seems that the “Made in the USA” narrative is stronger.

Nvidia became a symbol: as the AI concept leader, NVDA after the tariffs rose against the trend, became the representative of the “no fear of policy uncertainty”, ARM, SMCI, AVGO, etc. also strengthened, the whole AI plate into the “revaluation period”.

Follow-up possible trend?

If the next Fed officials do not rush to suppress the rate cut expectations, the market may be the following scenarios

 Long beneficiary direction: tech giants (NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL), interest rate sensitive growth stocks (ARKK, SMH), industrial/infrastructure stocks (CAT, DE, GE)

Risks to watch out for: QQQ/SPY technicals are close to overheating, Powell or other officials release hawkish letters, earnings season is approaching, and there could be a “positive cash-out-on-decline” 

What do our Reddit friends think?

Do you think Trump is just “rubbing it in” or is the impact of his policies really being priced into the market?

Will the Fed turn dovish under this political pressure?

2025-07-10 16:34:10,r/stocks,NVDA In-Depth Discussion Post: why do AI giants continue to strengthen? Up or down? My view at the end.,"Latest data and market performance 

As of today, Nvidia shares are trading at $162.44, with an intraday high of $164.71 (hitting the $4T market cap threshold), a slight intraday pullback, but generally stable, and up over 40% over the past three months, with a cumulative gain of \~20% since 2025 - a wave largely driven by the AI boom!

AI Demand Rampage: Blackwell Sovereign AI 

Blackwell architecture chips (including GB200 datacenter products and RTX 50 series) continue to drive datacenter and high-end gaming markets, with high demand through 2024-25 

Sovereign AI ""Wave: Citi raises target price to 190, focusing on strong growth in demand for government-grade AI deployments, AI data center market expected to grow to $563B by 2028

NVDA financial performance: far exceeded expectations 

Q1 2025 revenue reached $44.06B, up 69% y/y; of which data center revenue was $39.1B, up 73% y/y. ytd stock price rose 21%, more than triple in 3 years, the market is optimistic about continued expansion in the next 2 years.

Pullback pressure and potential risks: export restrictions impact: up to $8B of China sales are restricted, short-term profits and revenue there is a non-negligible disturbance 

valuation height: although a number of institutions still maintain a Strong Buy, the target price is mainly concentrated in the $174-$190 range, the potential upside space is limited.

Competition and macro uncertainty: AMD, Broadcom and other rivals continue to force, and the global economy, interest rates and policy may become uncertain launch factors.

My short-term technical outlook and market observation 

If the US market pulls back due to macro risks, NVDA will also be under short-term retracement pressure.

Resistance: $164.7-165 range highs are key, breakout could trigger a rally to $175-190. 

Support: $155-160. If broken, be wary of technical corrective pressure.

My view 

Long term holders: 

NVDA has AI “No. 1” status, architecture + chip + software ecosystem is mature, government and enterprise AI continues to expand, valuation is high but the next 3 years there is still a lot of room for growth.

Short-term traders: 

current position between resistance and support, high valuation stage, if touch export restrictions or macro negative, or 5-10% retracement opportunities. If it breaks $165, short-term follow-through long can be considered.

Conclusion Summary: 

Supporting factors: Blackwell chip architecture, AI demand continues to explode, government programs pushing Sovereign AI levels up, strong earnings.

Risk factors: export ban, valuation near record highs, increased competition, macroeconomic uncertainty.

What do you think?

Is the global government embrace of AI a bubble or a trend?

Will NVDA correct again in the short term? At what price would you take a position?

# 🔮 Scenario Forecasts

# ✅ Bullish Scenario

* Reclaim above 165 and hold → strong possibility of magneting to 167.5–170 zone.
* If bulls break 167.5 with volume, **172.5** becomes next resistance checkpoint.

# ⚠️ Bearish Scenario

* Break below 162.5 triggers exposure to 160 and possibly down to 157.5 or 155 (LP).
* Watch for failure at 165 – it could signal fading support and intraday reversal.

# 🧠 Final Interpretation

This chain reflects a **battle zone near 165**. Bulls are heavily loaded at that strike, while puts cluster directly below it. If NVDA maintains above 165 for the next hour, bulls are likely to press to 167.5+.  
However, if the 162.5 zone breaks under pressure, **155–160** becomes a likely destination.

**Forecast:** Slight **bullish edge** if 165 holds in the next **20–40 minutes**.  
If price slips below 162.5, bearish momentum could quickly escalate.",12,Icy-Mode-4741,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1lw1wc7/heres_the_full_option_chain_analysis_based_on/,1lw1wc7

(Reuters) -Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) hit a market value of $3.92 trillion on Thursday, on track to become the most valuable company in history, as Wall Street doubled down on optimism about AI.

 Shares of the leading designer of high-end AI chips rose as much as 2.4% to $160.98 in morning trading, giving the company a higher market capitalization than Apple's (AAPL.NaE) record closing value of $3.915 trillion on December 26, 2024.

Nvidia's (NVDA.NaE) newest chips have made gains in training the largest artificial-intelligence models, fueling demand for products by the Santa Clara, California, company.

2025-07-02 11:45:38,r/stocks,You Don't Need to Buy More,"The ‘elephant in the room’ for Palantir Technologies is its expected P/E of over 200x and market cap of over 100x sales, reflecting expectations of accelerated growth. Is the market forecast correct?

Palantir's unique position at the AI application layer, proven scalability, and fit with Western values justify its high valuation by making it a potential $1 trillion company.

Using Microsoft as a benchmark, Palantir would need $90bn in revenue, $68bn in gross profit, $23bn in free cash flow and a 40.3% compound annual growth rate in revenue to become a $1 trillion company.

Palantir's first quarter 2025 revenue growth rate of 39% is in line with the required 40.3% CAGR, and the US commercial revenue growth rate (71% year-over-year) suggests a potential acceleration to 70% by 2026.

Volatility is to be expected, and those who are sceptical about AI should avoid PLTR stocks. I have been following Palantir Technologies Inc since May 2024 and recommend it as a strong buy given its unique positioning in AI (personal view)

Palantir has a unique competitive advantage in the ‘application layer’ of AI, i.e. in the systems That is, in the user-facing part of the system, AI functionality can be accessed and used through specific applications.

Palantir has proven that its solutions can deliver real value to business customers and governments. More importantly, it has demonstrated the scalability of its business - as evidenced by its impressive Rule of 40 numbers.

Being a founder-led company with a nearly two-decade history in the U.S. military and government sectors is another competitive advantage for Palantir. The company has positioned itself politically as a strong supporter of Western values and an important military supplier in the age of AI.

Given these factors, Palantir is uniquely positioned to benefit from the acceleration of the AI race as AI applications (and their growth) shift from GPU vendors to agent-based AI and robotics. In short, Palantir is one of the few, if not the only, company that can play a central role in global workforce automation.

Recently, with Palantir's recent record highs, I wanted to focus on something else that is like an ‘elephant in the room’ for anyone considering taking a stake in Palantir: its high valuation.

What does the market see that you don't?

When I started covering Palantir, critics pointed to the company's inability to scale its business (Palantir was glorified as a ‘consulting firm’) and its questionable addressable market in AI (which some still see as a passing fad or bubble).

Today, those who are bearish on Palantir tend to acknowledge that the company is truly unique, but the criticism focuses on its valuation. To be clear, I fully understand those who are concerned when they see its expected P/E ratio exceeding 200x and its market cap exceeding 100x sales.Palantir's valuation is indeed high.

However, when I evaluate a stock, I always ask myself the same question: what does the market think about a company to give it such a high valuation?

I think the market is accelerating, fuelled by the AI race. A fundamental question investors should ask themselves is: Does Palantir have what it takes to be a $1 trillion company?

If the answer is yes, then the upside is about 3x relative to today's valuation.

To me, it's clear that the market believes this is a new Mag 7 company on the rise, and that's why it's giving PLTR such a high valuation, regardless of its accelerating growth.

In the next section, I will analyse what it will take for Palantir to grow into a $1 trillion market cap company. Feel free to judge for yourself whether this is realistic. If it is realistic, then I think long-term investors should be able to accept Palantir's current high valuation, which still represents a significant discount relative to the company's long-term trajectory.

What would a $1 trillion Palantir look like?

Not all companies with a $1 trillion market cap trade at the same valuation. In order to figure out what a $1 trillion market cap Palantir would actually look like, I would first find a reference company to compare it to. That's not easy because there are only about a dozen companies with a market cap of more than $1 trillion globally, and some of them are in completely different sectors, such as energy.

My company of choice is Microsoft. I think it is the closest to Palantir in terms of business, as most of its business is geared towards B2B customers and selling software solutions to them. Its business model is also partially similar to Palantir's in that it ‘locks in’ enterprise customers with hard-to-migrate software such as Microsoft Windows or Microsoft Office. Finally, Microsoft itself is a strong AI company with a high (albeit more reasonable) valuation. Is this likely to happen? My take on the AI race

Palantir's 39% year-over-year growth rate through the first quarter of 2025 is roughly in line with my assumptions for the above scenario, which could value the company at $1 trillion. Of course, I don't expect Palantir to really maintain a perfect 40%-ish growth rate for 10 years and then suddenly drop to 5%. I expect Palantir to accelerate its growth over the next few quarters and then eventually slow down.

In this context, it's worth noting that Palantir's overall revenue growth has historically lagged U.S. commercial revenue. For example, in the first quarter of 2024, U.S. commercial revenues grew 40% year-over-year, while total revenues grew 21%. One year later (Q1 2025), total revenues are roughly at the same level as commercial revenues a year ago (39% vs. 40%), while U.S. commercial revenues are now growing at 71% year-over-year.

I think the market has taken note of this trend and now expects Palantir's total revenue growth rate to accelerate from 40% to roughly 70% (on par with U.S. commercial revenues) by the beginning of 2026.Palantir may achieve this by the first quarter of 2026, later in 2026, or not at all. Market volatility is to be expected. Obviously, I expect the market to react differently in each case - in my view, adjustments will only be made if the growth rate does not match the expected acceleration.

Palantir's success in becoming a trillion-dollar company will ultimately depend on whether the AI race provides Palantir with enough potential markets to accelerate its growth.

A detailed discussion of the entire AI race is beyond the scope of this article. In short, I am personally very bullish on AI and I think we are at the beginning of a new industrial revolution. I believe that over the next few quarters we will see continued demand for GPUs and microchips translate into accelerated demand for cloud solutions and AI application layer solutions, which will benefit Palantir greatly.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), a leading manufacturer of ‘key components’ (GPUs) in the AI race, was one of the early beneficiaries of AI. The company has managed to grow its total revenue from just over $5bn in 2016 to $148bn. This equates to a staggering 46% compound annual growth rate over nine years, which is roughly in line with my model of how Palantir will grow to a $1 trillion valuation.

Personally, I think Palantir can replicate Nvidia's success over the next 10 years as the AI race rapidly shifts from hardware to new software applications.

That's why I don't think Palantir is currently overvalued. The market is simply more forward-looking than it has been in the past. Instead, I see \~3x upside from its current valuation, and I maintain my medium-term price target of $250 per share (consistent with my past research), which is based on its five-year CAGR of \~30% and an investment horizon of 2030. To be clear, I do believe that Palantir will eventually be valued at $1 trillion, and I expect to reassess my price target in the future. Needless to say, those readers who remain sceptical about AI and believe it is a bubble destined to burst would do well to steer clear of Palantir and, as I stated in the previous section, the bullish case for Palantir at its current price is only valid if the AI race accelerates. That is the fundamental risk of entering Palantir at this time.

Another key risk is volatility. With the market's current growth expectations for the company so high, its shares are likely to pull back sharply on even the slightest sign of weakness. In my view, Palantir is not only on track to meet its earnings guidance in the coming quarters, but it is also expected to consistently beat guidance and begin to show accelerated growth - possibly in line with its U.S. commercial sector's growth rate (70%) in the first quarter.

Even if the company eventually evolves into a new ‘Mag 7’ giant, adjustments and volatility are likely. No company is immune to poor results, and investors should be wary of Palantir's potential exposure to rapid changes in market sentiment in the future. In my opinion, anyone not comfortable with high volatility should avoid this stock.

Conclusion

At first glance, Palantir's valuation seems unsustainable. However, the market is always forward looking and if all it took to be a good investor was to read the P/E ratio, then we could all be Warren Buffett. The key question investors should be thinking about when analysing Palantir is: what is the market seeing beyond the numbers of the last few quarters?

Personally, I think the market is witnessing a company with a $1 trillion valuation. Overall revenue growth in the first quarter of 2025 (39%) is comparable to the growth in U.S. commercial sales a year ago (40% in the first quarter of 2024). I believe the market now expects this trend to continue, with Palantir growing at 70% of the level of U.S. commercial revenues in the first quarter of 2025.

Moving towards $1 trillion is achievable in my view. palantir needs to grow at a CAGR of about 40% over the next 10 years, slightly less than NVIDIA's 2016 year-to-date growth rate. In my view, Palantir is uniquely positioned in the AI ‘application layer’ and I believe it can achieve this goal.

A $1 trillion valuation implies about 3x upside from current price levels. Therefore, net of short-term volatility, I believe Palantir remains undervalued. While I maintain my five-year price target of $250 per share, if the company continues to perform as well as it has in the past, I expect to buy on the downside

A spokesperson for OpenAI told the news agency that OpenAI is in early testing with some of Google's TPUs, but it has no plans to deploy them at scale right now, the report added.

OpenAI is actively using Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs, and AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) AI chips to power its growing demand, the report noted.

A potential deal for Google's TPUs could have marked a supplier diversification for OpenAI, which has relied on Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips in the past to train its AI models and for inference computing. On Monday, analysts from Morgan Stanley said in a research note that potential usage of Google's chips for inferencing OpenAI's AI workloads would have been a significant endorsement of Google's hardware.

Over the weekend, it was reported that OpenAI has started using Google-made AI chips to build its products. However, it was noted that Google was not providing the most powerful TPUs to OpenAI, signaling its plans to use its most advanced versions to power the company's internal projects, including its own large language model Gemini.

2025-07-01 05:48:19,r/stocks,"As a long term investor, how to strategize my exit plan (when to sell)?","I know when a company is at a bargain to buy. Problem is, I know when to buy, but I don’t know when to sell. Do I sell when I need the money or when doctor tells me I only got a month to live? 

Let me give you several examples:

I was able to buy lots of Celsius stocks at $8 basis in 2020 when I began trying their drinks, enjoyed it and began seeing Celsius drinks sold everywhere at grocery markets and convenience stores. I felt confident. Celsius rose all the way to $95, the stock split and dropped all the way back to $25. Obviously, I did not sell any.

Same thing applies to FSLY, SQ, SE when I did not sell at the peak and watched them drop all the way back to my entry price then I panic sold and only secured a very little gain.

SMCI - I also panic sold at $23.81 for small gain and obviously, watching the price going back up is lots of pain. 

I was able to buy lots of crowdstrike last year in July when the outage caused chaos within airport and various companies. I also scooped some UNH as well due to recent (to me, it’s overreaction) free fall. 

I bought lots of ASTS at $11 and sold at $30 to get my entry money back. Then it went all the way to $46. 

Lots of people say, if a stock gives you 25% to 50%, it makes sense for you to sell all, take the profit and run. It’s not true at all. If you sold NVDA, TSLA, AMD and PLTR at 30% gain, you probably cried yourself to sleep every night. Some of the companies do have ten-fold potential if you decide to hold long. And selling them also subject yourself to short term capital gain tax. 

Also, PLTR PE ratio skyrockets. I understand military contract and AI reliance are legit, but there’s no guarantee for price to hold. When is a good time to sell? Which companies have bright future to hold strong despite free fall? Nobody has a crystal ball I understand but does reading business financial statement and learning their fundamental/ business model/ ecological system gives you a clue? 

Market is at ATH carried by major techs due to AI replacing humans leading to boost in company’s profit margin and future earning potential. But correction will eventually come.

I remain a committed long-term buyer of NVDA and I believe that Nvidia's leadership in AI and data centre technology makes it a must-have stock, despite the short-term risks.

How about now? NVIDIA's stock price and valuation just hit an all-time high, and many investors are wondering if NVIDIA is overvalued. Maybe they should take profits? Surely we'll see some short sellers active. For me, the journey has just begun. Since my recent article NVIDIA has announced some significant partnerships and at the recent GTC Paris conference its CEO made it clear to me that the growth story behind AI is continuing to accelerate. Let me bring you up to speed while we review whether NVIDIA remains a worthwhile buying opportunity.

It's worth noting that the US or Asia aren't the only ones committed to AI development - Europe is also active and not far behind. While Europe isn't often mentioned in these discussions (there's even a joke that the US owns AI while Europe has an ‘AI Act’ to regulate it), NVIDIA has highlighted its involvement in industrial/physical AI From the heart of Germany's automotive industry to the manufacturing hubs of France and Italy, Europe is adopting industrial AI and advanced AI robotics to address labour shortages, increase productivity and drive sustainable economic growth.

Robotics companies are developing humanoid robots and collaborative systems to integrate AI into real-world manufacturing applications. Backed by a $200bn investment programme and a coordinated effort by the European Commission, Europe is at the forefront of the next wave of AI-driven industrial automation.

It's easy to get caught up in concerns about potential overvaluation once the stock hits another record high. Take a look at NVDA's P/E ratio trend (I usually focus on EV/EBITDA, but it's showing the same trend). Since April 2025, the P/E has risen significantly as valuations have experienced a dynamic recovery (over 50%).

What's the key to deciding whether it's worth paying nearly $50 per share for $1 in earnings? It's the growth story behind NVIDIA and its continued path. NVIDIA's performance over the past few years suggests that it has a very good growth habit to reach its valuation levels. Just look at its P/E ratio in July 2023 - over 240x! Now, what surprises me is that buyers of NVIDIA actually made a lot of money during that time :)

How is that possible? NVIDIA's earnings are growing faster than its valuation. That's why you observe that valuation multiples have been declining since early 2024. Yes, the valuation multiple is now up nearly 50x, but ...... if NVIDIA continues on this path, delivers on its intended product roadmap, and the world continues to move towards an AI-driven economy, NVIDIA's current valuation will look cheap in a few years.

Risk factors? There are many, and there are no risk-free investments in the stock market. If the Trump administration escalates the trade war, which is currently on hold, NVIDIA could face some short-term issues that would impact NVIDIA's supply and customer operations. Yes, NVIDIA is well prepared for these changes, with some production being shifted to the U.S. and adjusted supply for Chinese customers (due to export restrictions). Any economic or geopolitical fluctuations could also hurt market sentiment, but in the long run I don't see this as a factor.

So, as an investor with a long-term focus and a bright future for NVIDIA, not only am I not selling any shares, I'm adding to my holdings. For me, NVIDIA remains a ‘Strong Buy’ stock. Cheers!",0,Aluseda,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lngvg0/the_nvda_journey_has_just_begun/,1lngvg0
2025-06-29 16:50:23,r/NVDA_Stock,Four reasons why NVDA is going higher . . .,"We all know that for most of the past year, NVDA shares have traded within a flat range without any kind of solid move higher. However, on Wednesday, investors sent the stock up 4% to a new all-time closing record. Friday’s session saw a gain of nearly 2% - marking the stock’s fifth consecutive positive session. Here's four reasons why the stock will continue to gain value going forward:

1. Nvidia’s chart pattern recently formed what’s known as a golden cross - when its 50-day moving average crosses above its 200-day moving average - implying that a long-term bull market may be emerging.

2. Nvidia releases its next earnings report the end of August. Increasing demand trends and the rollout of Nvidia’s new Blackwell chip both point to higher revisions from the company. Per Jordan Klein, an analyst at Mizuho, “In late August they’ll guide their October revenue, which I think could be notably higher than expected. It’s driven by Blackwell volumes ramping and those really start to scale up in July, and then more in August, probably into September.” 

3. Related to the aforementioned, CFRA analyst Angelo Zino says, “You’re at a point in time for Nvidia where now they’re going to scale up Blackwell, and now they’re going to get some of that margin expansion and some of those benefits here over the next couple of quarters,” he said. “And I think that’s a big reason why the stock is working as well."" 

4. Gene Munster, co-founder of Deepwater Asset Management, is also bullish on Nvidia’s forward trajectory. He said Nvidia’s valuation still looks compelling, even at these new all-time highs. “It’s probably the most attractive large-cap tech company on a price-to-growth basis,” he said. While some investors have pointed to hyperscalers building their own custom chips as a potential headwind for Nvidia, Munster said this is an unlikely theme due to the cost of building chips in house. Munster said he remains confident about Nvidia’s outlook since he believes the industry is still early in its buildout of AI. As evidence, he pointed to the multimillion dollar bonuses Meta has offered to poach OpenAI employees as the Facebook owner tries to supercharge its development efforts.

Me? I have ""skin in the game"" (2500 shares @ $94 cost basis) and I'm unequivocal in holding onto my shares going forward. How about you? What do you think?",172,Blade3colorado,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1lngiof/four_reasons_why_nvda_is_going_higher/,1lngiof

2025-06-27 19:04:50,r/stocks,Trump Announces Mineral Rights Deal With Congo What does this mean for the stock market?,"Just saw the big news: Trump brokered a mineral deal between the U.S. and the DRC that will give U.S. firms access to key minerals such as cobalt, tantalum, lithium, and copper in exchange for U.S. support for the Congo-Rwanda peace deal 

This looks like more than just geopolitical maneuvering, it could have long-term implications for the stock market and certain stocks.

Brief summary

The U.S., pushed by Trump, brokered a peace deal between Congo and Rwanda and signed a multi-billion dollar “minerals for security” agreement.

Trump's allies and private companies (including Massad Boulos) plan to invest over $500 million to build a smelter there, with the goal of moving away from dependence on the Chinese mineral chain.

Why this deserves investor attention

KEY MINERALS, STRATEGIC MATERIALS 

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) controls roughly 70 percent of the world's cobalt and 60 percent of its tantalum reserves-metals widely used in electric car batteries, chips, electronics, and military technology.

If the U.S. can establish its own supply chain, the global industrial landscape could be rewritten.

Capital Flows Could Change 

If U.S. miners and tech companies get in first, companies like Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), Albemarle (ALB), or lithium material companies like Livent (LTHM) could be the winners.

 Geo Risks vs Market Opportunities 

The Congo situation remains complex - if a peace deal stands, commodity prices could stabilize and U.S. firms may be able to gain control of resources in the long term; conversely, a short-term landmine.

Impact on Tech &amp; EV Sectors 

OEMs such as Tesla and the battery chain (e.g., NVDA, TSLA, BATT-type ETFs) could benefit if cobalt and lithium supplies become more stable and EV production costs fall.

CURRENT MARKET REACTION: 

Global mining stocks rallied in the early stages of the peace deal rumors, but then retreated as details of the deal remain unclear

Market Sentiment: cautiously optimistic and bullish in the long term, but short-term uncertainties remain (situation, implementation, opposition factions, etc.)

My recommendations from an investment perspective

Long-term Layout Focus on resource stocks (e.g. ALB, FCX) - once the agreement is implemented, it is a probable event for US companies to acquire substantial mineral resources.

Medium-term ideas Tracking battery, electric vehicle sector - if the cost of raw materials downward, vehicle margins and growth logic benefit.

Short-term operation Pay attention to the progress of events - the peace agreement is unstable and may be repeated; if you intervene, you can add a stop loss or hedge.

Macro observation If the United States to “resource diplomacy” as a means of follow-up in Greenland, Ukraine and other places may also have similar operations.

Some of my questions

Has anyone been following cobalt or lithium resource stocks? Any early layouts for this wave?

Do you think this peace deal is sustainable, or is it just a “paper peace”?

Bigger question: does this mean that China is loosening its grip on key minerals?",54,mattishannon,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1llz7l5/trump_announces_mineral_rights_deal_with_congo/,1llz7l5
2025-06-27 15:43:58,r/stocks,"Trump: US-China Trade Framework ""Signed""  Rare Earths Deal, Tariffs Rollback in Motion","Trump just said that the U.S. and China “signed” a framework deal on tariffs and trade. This follows the informal understanding they reached in Geneva back in May

Key points:

China confirmed both sides have finalized details of the framework

China will resume rare earth exports to the U.S

In return, the U.S. will remove countermeasures (probably the steep retaliatory tariffs).

Commerce Secretary Lutnick says 10 more trade deals are close mentions Canada, Japan, etc

Treasury Sec. Bessent says they want to wrap up trade talks by Labor Day (Sept 1)

The July 9 tariff deadline might get pushed back if talks show “good faith.”

Trump already sealed a deal with the UK; the EU is next, but tensions are high (threats of 50% tariffs on EU goods )

Stephen Miran (White House economic adviser) also said we may not see tariffs go below 10% long-term, but some countries could get better rates depending on how talks go

My take: This could be bullish for sectors exposed to China or dependent on rare earths (think EVs, semis, clean energy). If tariffs ease, expect to see some relief rallies across the board

[**NKE (Nike)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&amp;p=d)\-Reported EPS of $0.14 vs. $0.13 expected; revenue of $11.1B vs. $10.72B expected. Despite the miss on earnings, the NKE CEO expressed cautious optimism, stating that while improvements are expected, a full recovery remains distant (mainly due to tariffs which he said would have a $1B impact). Also forecasted \~5% Q1 sales decline, a better outlook than the 7% drop forecasted. Interested in seeing if this breaks $70 today. Sportswear and LULU have been inconsistent in recovery from tariffs, interested to see if LULU moves (and has potentially recovery) from this.

[**OKLO (Oklo Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OKLO&amp;p=d)\- Reportedly, the Trump administration is preparing executive actions to enhance energy infra and AI.

I'm seeing OKLO move off this but I'm interested other nuclear energy stocks as well. OKLO failed to break $60 in premarket but interested in watching further.

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)\-NVDA hit an all-time high along with the market, as the U.S. and China agreed on a trade framework and Iran/Israel tensions de-escalated. Momentum has continued as macro fears (mainly from Israel/Iran) die down and AI infrastructure investment remains elevated (CRWV acquiring CORZ). Interested in seeing if NVDA can hold above prior day's low ($153.49), momentum is pretty sustained and the move can continue far longer than anyone can expect. Since the trade framework with China was agreed upon, the next catalyst I'm potentially interested in is lifting of chip restrictions in China.

Also, ASML itself is very cutting edge on the innovation with hyper-NA etc.

Since June, NVDA's share price has been oscillating in the $140-150 range. On the latest trading day (June 24), NVDA climbed from its opening price of $144.17 to close at $147.90, a one-day gain of 2.59%, and further rose to $151.83 in pre-market trading. However, the share price is still slightly lower than the all-time closing high of $149.43 in January this year.

Fundamentals

AI Demand Explosion Loop Capital has just raised its one-year price target on NVDA to $250. NVDA's one-year price target has just been raised to $250, as it believes that the investment in mega cloud computing and “AI factories” will drive market capitalization to the $6 trillion level in the next few years. The recent concerns over the U.S. government's restriction on China's export of chip technology and China's regulator's investigation into the use of Nvidia chips in servers in China are putting pressure on the stock price in the short term, but the industry is still slightly below the $149.43 high set in January this year. Short-term stock price pressure, but industry insiders generally believe that this is only a phase of fluctuations

Technical Analysis

Since June last year, NVDA shares along the upward channel running, although there has been a slight retracement of the recent, but still standing firm above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating that the long momentum has not changed in the past five trading days, the turnover of the volume of the beginning of the year slightly enlarged compared to the average level, showing that institutions in the range of the lower end of the willingness of the layout. Lower near-support is at $145. Upper resistance is centered around the $150-155 line, with a breakout expected towards $175.



In the short term, the stock price is expected to be in the range of $145-155, and in the medium to long term, NVDA is expected to return to and exceed the target price of $175 in the next 6-12 months, and even head towards $250.",44,Aluseda,https://i.redd.it/whtnh1od339f1.jpeg,1lk7g5m

At the same time look at stuff like FSLR  record earnings massive backlog Biden literally throwing tax credits at solar yet the stock gets faded like it stole someone lunch Is this just rotation or is something fundamentally broken?

ENVX is another name I’ve been watching Battery tech seems legit management finally got their act together and yet it trades like a penny stock that survived off meme hype I averaged down under $10 feels like suicide or genius depending on the week.

Also SMCI can’t catch a bid even though everyone and their grandma thinks they printing money off AI servers It either the most obvious long of the year or a setup for a fullon rug pull.

Curious what you all are doing right now Rotating into safety? Still riding momentum? Or just staying in cash and doomscrolling?

While I remain bearish on the market as a whole right now, wise investors have said value can always be found in the market. A lot of the market feels very richly valued right now, especially large tech. AAPL, MSFT, NVDA and Meta all carry PE valuations close to 30 at the low end and closer to 50. Google however sits under 20.



Google is a major player in data centers, which I believe will be a huge space in the future. Google also has a strong AI program as well as a very healthy ad program. They continue to grow top and bottom lines and in March had a 38% profit margin on 90 Billion of revenue. 



Yet it seems the market isn’t interested in Google. It is by far the worst performing Mag 7 this year, down about 13%.

2025-06-23 15:47:17,r/stocks,Opportunities in the short-term market volatility? I'm sharing a low-risk offensive strategy that I've been tracking recently,"Over the past few weeks, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq have been fluctuating repeatedly at high levels. Many friends have said, ""The direction is unclear and we dare not act."" But in fact, the oscillation range is precisely when the low-risk strategy comes into play.

Recently, I have been tracking a simplified version of a strategy that combines range-bound oscillation and breakout following. The core logic is:

After determining the key support/resistance areas in major indices (such as $SPY / $QQQ) or large-cap stocks (such as $AAPL / $NVDA), observe the changes in trading volume and K-line structure.

Place an observation order near the upper edge of the range. Once the volume increases and breaks through, follow to open small positions. If there is a false breakout, the stop-loss is extremely small (usually less than 1%).

Auxiliary indicators use simple moving averages (such as EMA20, EMA50) + RSI divergence to determine whether the breakout is healthy.

Last week, I followed up with a small position using this framework when $NVDA broke through 1100, with a profit target in the 1150 range. The stop-loss is set below 1085, and the risk is very controllable.

I wouldn't say this is a ""sure-win strategy"", but its advantage lies in:

The risk is low, the cost of making mistakes is low, and it does not rely on prediction but only on market signals. It is suitable for volatile markets and the initial trend formation stage

2025-06-22 21:50:29,r/NVDA_Stock,NVDL: Massive Potential or Financial Ruin?,"(The following is for educational purposes only. This is not financial advice.)

The QQQ has now rallied just over 33.39% from its April 7th capitulation lows to its recent high on June 11th. While waiting for another correction, I’ve decided to take a deeper dive into NVDL as there’s been a buzz around it for a while now, especially among newer investors.

NVDL is a leveraged ETF (LETF) that states in no uncertain terms that it “seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 2 times (200%) the daily percentage change of the common stock of NVIDIA.” Now, since this seeks daily results of 200%, it makes sense that its actual return will inevitably begin to vary away from its 2x target. This is because leveraged ETFs will invariably begin to track farther away from their leverage target as more time passes from the initial purchase date. This phenomenon of LETFs trading at a different multiple than their stated target is commonly referred to as “volatility drag” and is exactly why LETFs can be so dangerous. LETFs leverage is reset at the end of each trading day.

This means that gains and losses are significantly magnified. As NVDA already trades at a higher beta than the market, by combining this with holding an LETF (to effectively leverage that common stock), you now have a recipe for home runs or utter disaster. Holding during a market rally can net massive returns. Conversely, holding through a correction or downtrend can absolutely destroy your portfolio.

Enough talk, let’s see an example. Had an investor waited until capitulation conditions emerged and bought the absolute low on April 7th, they would have bought NVDL for $23.12 per share. If they waited to sell until June 16th’s recent high of $60.80, they would have net a ludicrous 162% return. Of course, that's the absolute best case scenario. A much more reasonable estimate would be about half that as nearly all investors struggle to find and buy during the absolute lows. Regardless, an 81% return in just over one month’s time is insane.

Another risk factor to be aware of regarding these is that LETFs are also frequently subject to both a huge expense ratio (1.5%+) and a sort of premium decay effect. Premium decay refers to the decrease in an option's price (or premium) over time. This means that if the market has a correction, NVDL can permanently lose some of its value. Some of that value will be restored (and often is as reflected by NVDL’s share price over these past years). With that being said, NVDL will typically outperform during rallies, but over time it’s possible to incur these permanent hits or (a sort of) damage to its share price due to the LETFs magnified losses. The effects of this may be minimal in the short term, but it can compound over time and lead to unexpected deviations from the underlying asset that it tracks. This is especially true during a volatile market environment.

For example, during the beginning of February, when NVDA was trading at a low of $112.99, NVDL was trading at $43.32. NVDA subsequently revisited that $112.99 level on May 1st. However, due to the magnifying effect of NVDL’s gains and losses, instead of being back at $43.32 where it was initially when NVDA was trading at $112.99, NVDL only made it back up to $38.71. That’s a 10.64% overall loss. NVDL hasn’t kept up in this volatile market. Fortunately, you won’t have to worry about this effect if you only trade NVDL the way it is intended; trading intraday.

[Nvidia Price Difference: February 1st - May 1st](https://preview.redd.it/0yc0s4evap8f1.png?width=1240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbfa8e3cb4d629e11b41a9df1fc12be5f16df0c2)

TL;DR: NVDL can lose some of its value over time due to volatility decay and the compounding effects that are notorious to LETFs. Even though NVDL may outperform during rallies, gains and losses don’t compound the same as a normal non-leveraged ticker would. The effects of time exacerbate this issue, allowing for the possibility of NVDL not recovering to former price levels despite NVDA returning to its former highs.

For reasons outlined above, you absolutely must know what you’re doing if you decide to hold an LETF longer than the intended period (typically one intraday session). LETFs are not intended to be a long-term buy-and-hold strategy. When Nvidia is rallying, NVDL is a great tool for leverage. However, if you get caught holding an LETF (like NVDL) during a correction, it can swiftly become a massive liability.",20,[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1lhwvlv/nvdl_massive_potential_or_financial_ruin/,1lhwvlv

2025-06-15 17:41:16,r/stocks,All time highs on the horizon,"Nvidia Corporation is attractively valued and its strong EPS growth and profitability outpacing peers make it a compelling entry point. AI-driven demand from hyperscalers and new sovereign deals (UAE, Saudi Arabia) provides long-term headroom for continued growth. Despite the loss of China revenues and recent price stagnation, NVIDIA's fundamentals remain strong and its market leadership unquestioned. I am upgrading my rating on NVDA stock to Strong Buy, believing it is capable of delivering superior returns and has the potential to reach a $10 trillion valuation.



When I looked at NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) late last year, I thought the stock had a pretty good shot at 2025. While the stock has soared, the valuation has fallen because of strong earnings growth, thanks in large part to the seemingly never-ending demand for GPUs in exascale computing platforms. 2025 was destined to be the “Year of Blackwell,” and I expected the stock to continue to rise, albeit at a slower pace than in previous years.

Instead, we saw the stock briefly try to break out to a new all-time high, or ATH, before reversing sharply and selling off. We know the various reasons for this reversal. On the one hand, the broader market sold off amid tariff uncertainty, and few companies were immune. the release of DeepSeek (DEEPSEEK) in early 2025 triggered a sort of flash panic, with some claiming that the boom time for high-end chips was over. The logic was that DeepSeek would be able to save costs and increase efficiency so dramatically that companies running AI reasoning could rely on much less powerful chips. I think the evidence so far is that this reasoning is completely wrong, and instead we're seeing the Jevons Paradox come true.

It was probably inevitable that NVIDIA would now lose essentially all of its China-related revenue. At a recent conference, CFO Colette Kress pretty much poured cold water on the company's prospects for generating further revenue in China.

In my opinion, NVIDIA is attractively valued. The two best performers this year among the Big 7 tech giants have been Microsoft and Meta. looking at how NVIDIA compares to these peers, I see a big gap between them at the moment. In terms of price-to-earnings ratio, NVIDIA's valuation sits right in the middle of the three, but in terms of return on invested capital and medium-term EPS projections, it's way ahead.",0,Aluseda,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lc3azy/all_time_highs_on_the_horizon/,1lc3azy

2025-06-10 23:15:17,r/stocks,Taiwan Semiconductor’s May sales jump 39.6% as AI demand stays strong,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), the primary chip supplier to Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), reported a 39.6% year-over-year rise in May revenue as clients rushed to stockpile chips amid growing trade tensions.

The company generated NT$320.5 billion ($10.7 billion) in revenue last month. While this marks a strong annual increase, it's an 8.3% decline from April, when TSMC saw a sharper 48.1% year-over-year gain.

Revenue for January through May 2025 totaled NT$1,509.34 billion, an increase of 42.6% compared to the same period in 2024.

Looking ahead, analysts project a 50.3% Y/Y increase in TSMC's second-quarter sales, signaling continued robust demand despite month-over-month volatility.

TSMC chief executive and Chairman C.C. Wei said last week that the demand for the company's AI chips continues to outweigh supply.

The chipmaker reported strong Q1 results in April and issued a positive outlook for the coming years. ""We continue to observe robust AI related demand from our customers throughout 2025.

Rubin GPU and Vera CPU to Begin Sampling as Early as September

Nvidia’s next-generation AI chip development has made another breakthrough! According to the supply chain, the Rubin GPU and Vera CPU completed tape-out in June and could begin sampling to customers as early as September.

The Rubin GPU is built using TSMC’s third-generation 3nm process (N3P) and features CoWoS-L packaging with a package size 4 times the reticle limit. Mass production is scheduled for early 2026, bringing significant momentum to both TSMC's advanced process and packaging businesses ...

The development timeline of Nvidia's new chips has been smoother than expected, and early mass production is now slated for early 2026. These chips adopt a chiplet design, benefiting not just the N3P process but also the I/O die which uses N5B. Compared to Blackwell’s 3.3x reticle size, Rubin’s package is even larger, consuming more advanced packaging capacity.

TL:TR-Was just going to post the link, but then I got a bit verbose and into a stream of conciousness and ... it got longer. If you care about my thoughts...I've been invested since my FIRST shares in 2019(just a \~100) and then early 2020 \~1400) and I've added along the way.

If NOT, just click on the link. 

  
\------------------------

Not sure if this has been covered yet. Demand for NVDA GPUs is...really wanning. People are right! It's a cyclical business...(or so I've been told) and we've just come out of the slow end of the last cycle. 

  
I saw a couple analysts argue that Nvidia IS still cyclical. With their new products, there are ebbs and flows to the demand, the money the prices they can demand, the quantity they can manufacture. Just how supply constrained they are. 

Take the last quarter for example. If you take away the Chinese export control, you'd be looking at...\~10-12B more in guidance. Now...I'm of the opinion that they'll never regain the same market share they previously had. It's too important to China to not be reliant on the US and ...at the moment, they have no choice. 

BUT, hypothetically, lets say as part of a deal with China, they are allowed to sell more than just this B40 GPU, but something closer to the H20(which would progress as their own GPU's progress). 

  
On top of that, you've got robotics and FSD. Jensen already said he believed FSD was going to be worth a Trillion dollars.   
\*IF someone understood the context of that, I'd appreciate it. A Trillion dollars over the next 20 years, Eventually a Trillion a year for the licensing(which I would imagine would be decades away). I didn't catch that, just FSD=Lots of revenue. 

But Robotics...they going to dominate the future. I don't know exactly how they'll monetize that. If they'll be able to license it similar to FSD, if they'll derive income in a similar fashion to how they do with Data Centers. They'll sell the GPUs and as they can improve and make if cost advantageous to upgrade based on energy costs and performance and simply continue to sell. 

  
Either way, all this talk about Nvidia being overly reliant on 4 companies, the hyperscalers... well, that's beginning to look a bit silly now, isn't it?

I really struggling to see a Bear Case Scenario short of Trump going back to 'liberation day' tariffs, OR a the bond market crashing(and in this hypothetical, the prior could cause the latter and the latter could happen as a result of the ""Big beautiful bill.""

The 'Bull Case' is also difficult to really see other than you're going to have market beating growth the next 3-5 years at least. I don't think we hit 200 a share this year and I certainly don't think we're back at 1000 by 2030 or 1600 by 2033(these were both analysts projections, the 1000 a share from Forbes). 

  
I think 185 end of this fiscal year is entirely possible and 220 the following year just as likely IF we continue to innovate and demand moving forward in 2027, 2027 keeps increasing(and how does it now with autonomous vehicles on the horizon and humanoid robotics not long after that).

  
NVDA, TSM, AVGO, AMZN, wait to see a ruling from the Judge in the Google case in July about Chrome and see how that impacts GOOGL and then I'd say OKLO or UUUU or energy investments. 

But #1 is NVDA, #2 is AVGO or TSM. 

&gt;Together with private investments, the total investment sum for the ""AI Gigafactories"" is expected to reach 200 billion euros. The facilities are likely to be equipped primarily with Nvidia GPUs, for which there are currently hardly any technical alternatives.

&gt;  
It is questionable how many of the accelerators Nvidia can and wants to provide for the new data centers. For years, the demand for GPU computing power has constantly exceeded the amount of chips that Nvidia can produce at TSMC. Numerous CEOs of US tech companies are said to have already asked Jensen Huang in private conversations for more allocations of the rare GPUs. In contrast, the current negotiations with the EU may well be more transparent, as Huang's public appearances suggest.",19,Scourge165,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1l70cor/jensen_huang_eu_ai_imitative/,1l70cor

Scale AI is a company renowned for providing data annotation services, which are crucial for training large-scale artificial intelligence models, including those used by OpenAI.

This potential investment has raised many questions:

Is Meta attempting to establish an internal foundational model system in order to reduce its reliance on external suppliers such as OpenAI and Anthropic?

Does this mean that the focus has shifted from the attention to the metaverse to the emphasis on artificial intelligence infrastructure and vertical integration?

What kind of impact will this have on other stocks related to artificial intelligence? For instance, stocks like $NVDA, $PLTR, or $SNOW?

2025-06-07 23:40:08,r/stocks,"Earnings up, yields up   is Trump’s $3T bill a bull trap in disguise?","Everyone’s watching the Musk vs. Trump drama like it’s the main event, but markets should probably be paying more attention to what’s actually in Trump’s $3T “big beautiful bill”  because it’s very much alive and moving forward

Despite Musk calling out GOP lawmakers, threatening primaries, and warning about the deficit (which, by the way, multiple analyses say will balloon by $2.4T+), the bill’s still on track. Thune and Senate leadership basically shrugged him off. They’re pushing this thing through  and fast

Here’s where it gets interesting from a market angle:

They're talking about cutting back the $40K SALT deduction to save money. But whatever they save might immediately get canceled out because there's also strong pressure to make temporary business tax breaks permanent  stuff like R&amp;D deductions, bonus depreciation, and interest expensing

That’s a huge deal if you're long big-cap tech, industrials, or healthcare. These tax breaks boost reported earnings pretty directly. If they go permanent, EPS estimates probably move higher without companies having to do anything operationally. Think MSFT, LMT, UNH  names like that

But here’s the tradeoff: the bill’s already inflationary. If they don’t pay for it, bond yields are going to feel it. So while stocks might get an earnings tailwind, valuations could stay capped or even compress further if the 10Y starts creeping above 5% again

And the AI provision buried in the bill? Wild. Originally it said states couldn’t regulate AI for 10 years — a total federal preemption. Now they’re walking that back to a softer “you lose broadband funding if you pass certain laws” version. Doesn’t matter much fiscally, but for megacaps like NVDA and GOOG, this is one less regulatory headache. The moat just got a little deeper

One curveball that could raise the cost: Section 899. It lets the president slap taxes on foreign countries seen as ""discriminatory."" Some senators want to remove it, which could limit future revenue and geopolitical leverage. Not a today problem, but if you're watching defense and energy stocks tied to foreign trade, it matters

And now there's infighting about Medicaid cuts. Josh Hawley’s out here writing NYT op-eds saying this bill punishes working-class voters while handing corporate tax cuts. He’s not totally wrong. If the GOP starts shifting back toward economic populism, how long do these business-friendly tax policies actually last?

So here’s the real market question buried in all this: Are we about to get an earnings boost that the bond market completely wipes out?Because if you’re buying the earnings upgrade but ignoring the debt story  you might be trading the right trend with the wrong multiple",906,KenKneeHee,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1l5vyh4/earnings_up_yields_up_is_trumps_3t_bill_a_bull/,1l5vyh4

I’ve built a strong intuition over the years. In the early 2020s, I trusted it and went all in on NVDA with $40k—and it turned into hundreds of thousands. But then I got cocky. I listened to my brother-in-law (never again), invested in a stock without doing research, and lost $70k. Since then, my confidence has been tainted.

I dedicate myself to rigorous research, spending hours each day on relevant reading. While some may claim I’ve made poor investment choices, that’s simply not the case. I’ve studied The Intelligent Investor along with several other books recommended by Warren Buffett, treating them like a college curriculum—complete with notecards and in-depth analysis. My investment strategy blends both value and growth principles.

My family have come to know I make good recommendations, so they ask me would I would buy:

* my brother asked so I recommended Palantir at $20. He’s up 500%.
* my friend asked so I recommended Vista &amp; Constellation Energy, and NuScale. All up huge.
* my uncle asked so I recommended MicroStrategy at $150. Up 147%.
* my brother-in-law asked so I recommended CoreWeave—he’s up 139%.
* my sister asked so I recommended the Circle IPO via Robinhood—up 167%.

Meanwhile, I’ve just been sitting on the sidelines, scared of losing more, stuck in analysis paralysis. That $70k loss deeply affected my self-image.

Has anyone else been through this? Lost big and then lost your confidence? How did you get it back?

I’m disabled and have severe chronic pain throughout my body. It’s not just investing that I have a hard time regulating…. It’s life itself. I constantly have fight or flight emotions coursing though my veins. I think EMDR is probably the answer im looking for.

Companies like AAPL NVDA and INTC could see movement due to trade implications. A favorable deal might give these companies the green light for continued business operations in China, potentially boosting their stock prices

Chinese consumer demand could get a significant boost especially for companies with exposure in the region like NKE or SBUX However if the deal falls short of expectations those stocks could take a hit 

 Even though we’re all hoping for a positive agreement the market could react negatively if the deal is underwhelming or doesn’t address key issues like intellectual property or market access.

2025-06-05 16:09:42,r/stocks,CRWV: AI Rocket or Debt Bomb? Thoughts?,"Alright, looked into **CoreWeave (CRWV)**. It's an ""AI Hyperscaler"".. gives GPU (Nvidia) for AI stuff. Stock went nuts since IPO (like 300% up)  

**Quick Take:** CRWV: Big AI growth, Nvidia likes them. BUT huge debt, only 2 big clients (MSFT, OpenAI), and weird deals with Nvidia &amp; Applied Digital where they invest in each other.

**The Good:**

* **AI Demand:** Selling GPU power for AI. Revenue shot up: $229M (2023) to maybe $8B (2025 est).Q1 2025 rev $981.6M, +420% YoY. 
* **Nvidia Favored?** Gets Nvidia's new GPUs (GB200s) early. Nvidia invested, owns \~7%. 
* **Huge Contracts:** $10B Microsoft deal (MSFT is 72% of Q1 rev!).\~$16B from OpenAI. 
* **Stock Surge:** Stock jumped big after IPO from AI hype &amp; news. 

**The Bad:**

* **Massive Debt:** Over $12.7B raised (equity/debt) by end 2024, liabilities &gt;$18.8B Q1 2025. Interest could be $2B+/year.S-1 said ""material weaknesses in internal control"". Not great.  
* **No Profit:** Big revenue, still big losses. Net loss $863M (2024), $314.6M (Q1 2025). 
* **Few Customers:** MSFT is 72% of revenue. OpenAI other main one. Risky.  
* **Nvidia Reliance:** All GPUs from Nvidia. If Nvidia has issues, CRWV does too.  

**The Weird Loops:**

* **Nvidia:**
   * Nvidia investor (\~7% stake). 
   * CRWV buys all GPUs from Nvidia. So NVDA invests, CRWV buys NVDA chips.  
   * NVDA *did* pay CRWV for services ($320M deal 2023).Now NVDA says not a customer, and Q1 rev from them &lt;10%. So NVDA invests -&gt; CRWV buys NVDA GPUs -&gt; NVDA *used to* pay CRWV. Circular.  
* **Applied Digital (APLD):**
   * CRWV has \~$7B, 15yr lease deal with APLD for data centers. 
   * CRWV also has warrants for \~5.5% of APLD. So CRWV is big APLD customer AND investor.  

**So?**

Is CRWV a smart play with AI giants, or a debt bomb waiting to go off if partners, debt, or AI hype fails? They're racing to make cash from contracts to pay debt &amp; upgrade GPUs before tech gets old. 

What u think? Big win or big fail?

2025-06-05 15:30:57,r/stocks,Is NVIDIA Getting Too Hot? My Short-Term Concerns with NVDA ($141.92),"I wrote my thesis on Palantir 30 mins before posting this one and looks like folks are not liking it. Long term NVDA could go up. This is purely a short term play. 

This is going to be a similar take to that one. 

NVIDIA’s been on an insane run lately. It was up over 20% since mid May and pushing back to all time highs around $142. The AI hype is obviously still alive and well. I genuinely believe AI is the future but still we need to be a bit more realistic.

Here’s what’s making me cautious:

* Options activity is nuts right now — the $140–$150 calls are getting snapped up like crazy
* Lots of short-dated call buying, mostly retail
* The whole “it can’t go down” vibe is creeping back in
* The stock’s up 10–12% straight with barely any pause

To be clear, I’m not saying NVDA is a bad company. It’s a beast, and the AI story is real. But even the strongest stocks usually pull back a bit after a move like this.

I’m looking at a possible short if it pushes into the $143–$145 range. Nothing aggressive, just a trade idea. Thinking we could see a pullback to $135ish (which lines up with the last breakout zone).

If it breaks above $147 though, I’m out. Could easily rip to $150+ from there.

Not trying to fade the long-term trend here. I am just synthesizing unusual market activity, insider moves, options flow, sentiment, technical and news analysis.

For context, I used to be a server which is how I made my money, but now I do not work and only earn a bit of money though babysitting/selling my old clothes/etc. This money has just been sitting in my checking and savings account for the last 3 years, earning less than a dollar of interest per year ...

I did a lot of research and made a plan for what to do with this money. Keep in mind I am going to college in the fall, but I don't have to do any loans/payment because I got a lot of scholarships and parents got the rest. So I just wanted to ask how my plan is and if anyone has any advice:

Checking account: $750 (I'm pretty frugal/don't spend much money, though I know I will have to spend more in college)

High Yield Savings Account: $3000

Stocks (About $4500) These are the ones I currently have picked out and how much I would put in. Should I get rid of any and just put it all in SPLG or SCHD or is this ok?

SPLG (50%) SCHD (35%) VUG (10%) NVDA (5%)

then i was thinking about putting $500 in a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. But should I just wait until I get a part time job (probably a few months) to make a Roth IRA? Because you need income to contribute to one right?

To summarize I just want to know if those stocks I picked are good or if I should get rid of some or choose others, and if I should make a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund or wait until I have a job to make a Roth IRA.",0,coolguyisepic,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1l3glu5/investing_5000_as_a_17_year_old/,1l3glu5

2025-06-03 12:39:33,r/NVDA_Stock,Nvidia Partners with Illumio,"NVIDIA Partners With Illumio To Enhance Zero Trust Security For Critical Infrastructure


NVIDIA's partnership with Illumio is a significant step in enhancing cybersecurity, particularly for critical infrastructure. The collaboration brings together NVIDIA's
powerful hardware, like GPUs and networking technologies, with Illumio's software platform focused on Zero Trust security and micro-segmentation. The main goal of this partnership is to protect high-value assets from cyberattacks by implementing a ""never trust, always verify"" approach to security.

Why it Matters…

The idea behind Zero Trust is that traditional perimeter defenses, like firewalls, are no longer enough in today's hyper-connected world. The perimeter is essentially dissolving as businesses adopt cloud computing,
remote work, and lot devices. This is where the partnership between NVIDIA and Illumio is so crucial. By combining Illumio's innovative Zero Trust framework with
NVIDIA's high-performance computing infrastructure, they're aiming to create a more robust defense against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.

2025-06-03 08:55:09,r/stocks,"VOO etf vs ""safe"" + growth big cap stocks?","Hi guys, so I know this question was asked before. But I hope to hear your opinions on this. I know buying VOO etf and contribute every month is the key. However, I can't ignore the fact that there are some relatively safe mega cap companies with growth potential like NVDA, Amazon, Google. etc. As of now, my portfolio includes NVDA, amazon, google, Apple &amp; baba.

I did a quick calculation on compounding interest for VOO. In 5 years, with an average of 9% return (I am being conservative here), a $50k initial investment with no monthly contribution in VOO could be $76,931. So basically around 50% return after 5 years. If I put $1000 monthly contribution, the amount would be $148,747 after 5 years. This is almost triple.

Now mega caps like amazon, google, NVDA, a 50% increase in their market cap in 5 years is possible. But these companies are 2-3 trillions now. They will certain get bigger but 50% bigger is a lot and pretty sure they won't get triple in 5 years. Looking back 5 most recent years, SP500 has been up 94.58% while Amazon lags behind only 68.57%. Google did better at 139.82%. Apple is 153.9%. Microsoft is 152%. NVDA is a different monster at 1455%.

So now I start to regret my buying strategy. I should just buy VOO and make monthly contribution, and only keep smaller positions for these stock picks. Am I missing something here? is VOO's compound interest that powerful? is there any downside for investing in SP500 ?",1,coopermug,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1l259sh/voo_etf_vs_safe_growth_big_cap_stocks/,1l259sh

Recap Investopedia's coverage of last Friday's trading here. The week also brought the latest set of trade ructions, with President Donald Trump on Friday raising fresh questions about the state of affairs with China.

In addition to a jobs report due Friday, investors also will be watching for reports on job openings and private-sector payrolls. Updated data on the U.S. trade deficit and consumer credit levels will be in focus, as will manufacturing and services industry data, including the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), construction spending, and factory orders.

In addition to Powell’s comments on Monday, Fed representatives speaking this week include Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, and Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee.

**Jobs Report Comes As Fed Faces Pressure on Interest Rates**  
The scheduled Friday release of the May U.S. jobs report will show whether the labor market continues to exhibit strength after employers added more jobs than analysts expected in April, as the unemployment rate remained at 4.2%.

Trump has been applying pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates from their current levels of 4.25% to 4.5%. Fed officials have said that they are in “wait-and-see” mode as the labor market remains strong and inflation comes under pressure from U.S. tariffs.

Earlier in the week, market watchers will get updates on job openings, private-sector payrolls, and weekly jobless claims.

Several Fed officials are scheduled to speak, including Federal Reserve Chair Powell, Dallas Fed President Logan, Chicago Fed President Goolsbee, and Philadelphia Fed President Harker. On Wednesday, the Fed’s Beige Book will provide more details on economic conditions throughout the country.

The Thursday scheduled report on the U.S. trade deficit comes as tariff threats have pushed shippers to increase imports ahead of the expected import taxes.

Investors will also be watching manufacturing and services industry surveys scheduled for release this week, as well as updated data on consumer credit levels, factory orders, and construction spending.

**Tech, Retail Earnings Reports in Focus**  
Chipmaker Broadcom’s scheduled financial report, due Thursday, comes on the heels of industry leader Nvidia’s (NVDA) report last week that showed continued demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products. Broadcom reported a 77% jump in its AI-related revenue in its most recent financial release as company executives forecast continued growth in that sector.

Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Holdings is expected to release its earnings on Tuesday. The firm said in early May that it planned to cut 5% of its workforce. Guidewire Software, which provides services to insurance providers, is also expected to deliver an update on its AI products Tuesday.

Logistics software provider Descartes Systems Group is expected to release its earnings on Wednesday. Shippers continue to grapple with the impact of Trump's tariffs on the supply chain.

With consumer sentiment surveys showing increasing concerns over economic conditions, investors will be watching reports from retailers for signals on spending. Scheduled reports from Dollar General on Tuesday and Dollar Tree and Five Below on Wednesday will provide a look at consumer traffic at those stores. Campbell’s scheduled report on Monday will shine a light on food spending, while fashion brands Lululemon and Calvin Klein parent PVH also will be reporting.

Other noteworthy reports this week include Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO, a competitor to Tesla in that country, and information technology provider Hewlett Packard Enterprise.",56,callsonreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1l0ouqw/what_to_expect_in_the_markets_this_week_june_26/,1l0ouqw

2025-06-01 02:39:19,r/NVDA_Stock,Nvidia needs to make an ultra-low latency inference product,"Cerebras and groq and co are DOA so far because their chips are fundamentally flawed despite having the right idea. They saw that inference needed low latency real time capabilities, this is actually incredibly, very important, and the lack of it is holding back robotics among many other things. However, their networking story is completely unworkable, and what they actually deliver is garbage.

IMO Nvidia needs to take the plunge and do it better than them. Any chip design experts feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but sram is just very difficult to scale up. With such a low quantity of sram, even on a wafer scale product (44GB on WSE-3), you are not going to be able to run leading models.

With nvidia's money though, I think we can get a wafer-scale product with around 100GB-200GB of sram, which can work with clever MoE routing. If we don't want to go down that route, IMO the most promising path that's open to a company of nvidia's scale that's not open to a startup, is inventing a whole new memory product that's better than sram, better than HBM4.

IMO this hypothetical memory product would sit between sram and HBM and would be slower than sram, but be fast enough to fix the problem of real time inference. Guard it closely and don't let anyone else use it, and it'll be devastating to the market IMO.",17,Charuru,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1l0c3qt/nvidia_needs_to_make_an_ultralow_latency/,1l0c3qt

2025-05-30 00:15:01,r/NVDA_Stock,I Was Right Again (Kinda): Q1 Earnings Actuals Update and Analysis!,"NVDA’s Q1 earnings are out, and before fully diving into the numbers, let’s quickly look at what both analysts and I expected to see from the print:

Analysts - $0.93 on $43.3 Billion  
My Estimate - $0.97 on $44.3 Billion  
Actuals - $0.96 on $44.1 Billion

Focusing solely on the headline print, I was technically closer to the actual numbers than the analyst consensus. The issue is, it turns out my variances just ended up canceling out better, and some of my estimates were much farther off than the consensus, such as Data Center Revenue and Q2 Revenue Guidance.  

The table below shows the revenue estimate breakdown for analysts, me, and the actuals. Interestingly, it shows a large gaming variance, more than offsetting lower-than-expected numbers for the remaining segments. Analysts were pretty accurate in forecasting data center revenue, yet were way off (with me) on Gaming, and were pretty bullish the emerging robotics segment which disappointed. 

https://preview.redd.it/jtuew8y3ps3f1.png?width=725&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9bbfc305f794be916d22ca9ce3127c1207763b4

The current narrative seems to be “China impact worse than thought, everything else stronger than thought,” but I am not sure I buy that idea given the data. Based on this table, NVDA missed against analyst expectations on every revenue segment except Gaming, yet beat the total with how large the Gaming Segment surprised. Things get even messier when looking at Earnings Per Share.

NVDA usually reports two EPS figures, GAAP and Non-GAAP. However, this earnings report saw three EPS prints due to the weird accounting with the H20 charge. My calculation focused on the third type of EPS, which NVDA called “Non-GAAP excluding H20 Charge,” while analysts were mixed on how to account for the charge in their EPS estimate. CNBC reported that the analyst consensus for Excluding H20 EPS was $0.93, which was lower than my estimated $0.97 and the $0.96 reported.

“Regular” Non-GAAP earnings were $0.81, and analysts reporting on this figure were anticipating between $0.75-$0.85, depending on the source. GAAP Earnings were $0.76, which illustrates how impactful the charge was to Non-GAAP earnings, and why NVDA reported a figure that excluded it. 

Guidance for Q2 total revenue was $45 Billion, below analyst consensus and far below my estimation. NVDA noted guidance would have been $8 Billion higher ($53 Billion) without any China disruption. The Company guided for higher margins in Q2 than expected, and much higher than the 70% consensus. The report noted NVDA’s commitment to returning to mid 70s for gross margin. The table below visualizes NVDA’s guidance against estimates and further demonstrates how murky this report is.

https://preview.redd.it/igksfmz5ps3f1.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c829de620928d9a0e24131eb4c0008e14382d74

While the below graph shows my estimates overall outperformed analysts, it hides the fact that some of my estimates were pretty far off, and canceling variances benefited my calculation.

https://preview.redd.it/tvk3i3d8ps3f1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8222dc33ed37f87b64feb69f740702497c3b9efd

The last graph shows the cumulative variance since I began tracking my estimates formally. I have done pretty well anticipating EPS, while being overly bullish on Revenue. This is meant for context and credibility.

https://preview.redd.it/db8t3rcaps3f1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e196ffcd3d5ca073a7e6289357cad7ae06f7a90e

Overall, the focus remains on how NVDA will navigate the disruption in China. This report shows they are not the same company without full access to China, and if they remain locked out of that market, price targets and earnings estimates might start to come down. The other possibility is TACO (Trump Always Chickens Out), and NVDA will continue to access the large Chinese demand again. However, without that clarity, volatility should remain high. 

**TL;DR**  
2 Non-GAAP EPS Numbers  
My EPS estimates have been solid  
My Total Revenue estimates were closer than the analysts’  
Segment estimates were trash  
Gaming saved the day  
China problems significant

The court stated they lacked a valid national emergency justification and infringed upon congressional powers. We saw a huge move in the market afterhours yesterday, mainly interested to see if we can continue the move. Is the tariff madness over? Absolutely not, but I'm interested in seeing if we keep momentum upwards. 

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)\-NVDA reported Q1 revenue of $44.1B, with data center revenue at $39.1B vs $39.3B exp.

2025-05-29 15:14:51,r/stocks,"We Should Never Have Doubted You, Jensen!","I had [mentioned yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kx5azw/nvidias_longterm_prospects_remain_terrific_im/) that I wasn’t going to hedge Nvidia’s Q1 earnings, ignore the noise, and stay invested for the long term. Now I’m kicking myself for not buying more when it was $130-$132. **Nonetheless, I plan to add more, paying $10 extra for a stock I expect to reach over $250 in the next three years, is OK. And I can always add more on declines.**

The small $ 1 Bn beat for Q1 results was impressive considering the $ 2.5 Bn in lost H-20 sales to China, but even more astounding was the reaffirmed guidance of $ 45 Bn for Q2, **in spite of $8 Bn in H-20 lost sales in Q2.** One can imagine where the stock would have skyrocketed if guidance had come in at $ 53 Bn instead of $ 45 Bn!

**Trying to thread the needle and trade Nvidia is missing the woods for the trees.** 

**Inferencing demand is a major revenue catalyst for Nvidia over the next several years, as evidenced by the significant increase in tokenization. Similarly, seen is Agentic AI demand, which is a revenue-bearing product of reasoning and inference, and will continue to grow.**

This was Jensen Huang on the conference call today on inference demand.

&gt;“Well, we would like to serve all of it, and I think we're on track to serve most of it. Grace Blackwell NVLink72 is the ideal engine today, the ideal computer thinking machine, if you will, for reasoning AI. There's a couple of reasons for that. The first reason is that the token generation amount, the number of tokens reasoning goes through, is 100 times, 1,000 times more than a one-shot chatbot. It's essentially thinking to itself, breaking down a problem step-by-step. It might be planning multiple paths to an answer. It could be using tools, reading PDFs, reading web pages, watching videos, and then producing a result, an answer. The longer it thinks, the better the answer, the smarter the answer is. And so, what we would like to do, and the reason why Grace Blackwell was designed to give such a giant step-up in inference performance, is so that you could do all this and still get a response as quickly as possible. Compared to Hopper, Grace Blackwell is some 40 times higher speed and throughput compared. And so, this is going to be a huge, huge benefit in driving down the cost while improving the quality of response with excellent quality of service at the same time.”

**One-year product cadence:** Nvidia has been very proactive when it comes to its product line-up, and showed off an ambitious slate of coming products at its [annual GTC conference](https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/nvidias-big-show-hits-its-marks-but-plays-to-tough-crowd-35462acb?mod=article_inline) in March, including updated versions of its Blackwell chips that are in particularly high demand by companies trying to build up state-of-the-art AI networks. 

[According to the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/nvidia-nvda-q1-earnings-report-2025-62ff6a10?mod=hp_lead_pos4), analysts expect the Blackwell lineup alone to generate nearly $98 billion in sales in the current fiscal year ending in January and a further $119 billion next year.

And Blackwell contributed about 70% of datacenter sales in Q1-26, successfully transitioning from the Hopper series

**I suspect that the $200 Bn revenue number for FY 2026 will be short, and with all the sovereign and other AI demand, it might even be exceeded, even without Chinese sales, with GPU cluster investment announcements from sovereign AI and Oracle and xAi, easily making up for the lost sales.**

Accelerated computing is the new paradigm, and I can see Nvidia dominating in every sphere of accelerated computing. 

From Jensen Huang on the Nvidia earnings call. 

&gt;“So, that's the fundamental reason. That was the core driving reason for Grace Blackwell NVLink72. Of course, in order to do that, we had to reinvent, literally redesign the entire way that these supercomputers are built, and -- but now we're in full production. It's going to be exciting. It's going to be incredibly exciting. And so, computing is one stack, one part of it. But remember, enterprise IT is really three pillars; it's compute, storage, and networking. And we've now put all three of them together finally, and we're going to market with that.""



Cloud computing was just the start; these will follow. 

**On-Premise Computing and PCS** – Nvidia has already announced new products –  RTX Pro Enterprise AI server that runs everything On-Prem. DGX Spark and DGX Station, which are going to replace “traditional” CPU-run PCs, are designed for developers who want to work on-prem.

**Enterprise AI** is still a very nascent market and could be huge for Nvidia. A computing system that can integrate and run enterprise AI stacks, run enterprise IT stacks, but add AI to them. The Networking platform business using NVLink is available for competitors to make advanced GPU clusters.

**Physical and Industrial AI** – through the Omniverse and robotics: 

Jensen Huang on the earnings call:

&gt; “And then lastly, industrial AI. Remember, one of the implications of the world reordering, if you will, is a region's onshoring manufacturing and building plants everywhere. In addition to AI factories, of course, there are new electronics manufacturing, chip manufacturing being built around the world. And all of these new plants and these new factories are creating exactly the right time when Omniverse and AI and all the work that we're doing with robotics is emerging. And so, this fourth pillar is quite important.""



Every factory will have an AI factory associated with it. And in order to create these physical AI systems, you really have to train a vast amount of data. So, back to more data, more training, more AIs to be created, more computers. And so, these four drivers are really kicking into turbocharge.”

**NeoClouds** – Small business AI rentals through NeoClouds, like Coreweave and Nebius, should be a huge business. 

Lost in all this was Gaming revenue, which grew 42% to $3.76 billion, 33% above analysts’ forecasts! $ 1 Bn beat on $2.78 estimate – that is extremely impressive and attributed to Blackwell’s product strengths. Auto was another gainer, jumping to $567Mn up 72% YoY.

**I believe we’re in just the 2nd innings of a 9 innings AI revolution, and my 3-year target for Nvidia is $250, and I’ll continue to add on declines.**",0,Fountainheadusa,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kyai1a/we_should_never_have_doubted_you_jensen/,1kyai1a

But a last-minute reprieve from Washington's planned AI diffusion rule, which was put in place by the Biden administration to limit GPU sales to certain countries, and major investment announcements during Trump's visit to the Middle East have increased Nvidia's share price to more than $136 — slightly less than 2% up from the stock's value at the start of the year, and up roughly 20% over the past 12 months as of Wednesday.",70,yahoofinance,https://i.redd.it/8yjm0v67dl3f1.png,1kxta37

2025-05-28 04:00:19,r/stocks,Nvidia's Long-Term Prospects Remain Terrific - I'm going to ignore Q1-earnings noise.,"Nvidia (NVDA) $135 Pre earnings

Nvidia’s Q1-FY2026 results may be noisy, but I’m not hedging it; I own shares, remain long-term bullish and will ignore earnings volatility, and may even add more.

Institutional or other investors who emphasize Blackwell absorbing H20 losses (About $13 Bn in lost annual sales and $5.5Bn in chargebacks for unsold inventory-due to the government ban on H20 exports to China) may be trying to thread the needle, **either believing that the markets will not be happy with the Blackwell ramp or the speed of the ramp to mitigate these lost sales. But for a company that is firing on so many cylinders, I’m sanguine about the Q1-FY2026 results, and am absolutely positive about the long-term prospects – it’s business as usual for the best of the best. This is a once-in-a-lifetime** opportunity, and for once it’s not a cliche.

The momentum around inferencing, and the computing power needs for inferencing and reasoning models suggest that Nvidia’s is a supply problem – and even if the $ 200 Bn revenue estimate for FY Jan 2026 is off by a small percent, FY 2027 to FY 2030, will more than make up for it. 

Morgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore, who has an Overweight rating and $160 price target on Nvidia, said the Jensen Huang-led company is likely to be fine if it can show investors that rack supply has accelerated.

**“Our data points would suggest that in recent weeks, the full year rack forecasts have started to be revised upwards by 50 %+,” Moore added, citing recent channel checks that suggest the issues have been resolved and are now starting to show up in numbers.**

**Additionally, investors appear to be underestimating the “unprecedented explosive token growth” commentary coming from Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), Moore posited.**

**“Every hyperscaler has reported unanticipated strong token growth,” Moore explained. “But our conviction is not driven by that, it’s driven by the fact that literally everyone we talk to in the space is telling us that they have been surprised by inference demand, and there is a scramble to add GPUs.”**

Moore continued: “This is not driven by the limitless aspirations for training megaclusters fueled by highly speculative venture capitalists; **this is proof that the models are being used, and driving revenue,** which mitigates the biggest overhang on NVIDIA stock that this is all driven by venture funding that will dry up. **The strength we highlight here is driven by usage, by the revenue-generating part of the business, and provides proof points that the scaling of inference as we move to reasoning-oriented models is a real thing.** We are seeing this spanning geographies, as well, so published concerns about China having stockpiled H20s seem inaccurate.”

**I think Nvidia will have a similar overwhelming market share and growth in inference GPUs and their 1 year product roadmap ensures that they remain ahead of the competition– this is just the beginning.**",26,Fountainheadusa,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kx5azw/nvidias_longterm_prospects_remain_terrific_im/,1kx5azw

2025-05-25 16:56:51,r/stocks,"Nvidia earnings Trump tariff updates, and the Fed's preferred inflation gauge: What to know this week","Stocks' feverish rebound over the past month is now on pause as growing concerns about the fiscal deficit have sent Treasury yields roaring higher and President Trump is once again threatening to escalate tariffs.



On Friday, Trump threatened to place a direct 25% tariff on Apple products not made in the US while also warning he'd ramp up duties on the European Union to 50% at the start of June. This solidified a week of decline for stocks as the Nasdaq Composite (\^IXIC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (\^DJI) dropped about 2.4%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 (\^GSPC) slid roughly 2.6% on the week.



In the week ahead, updates on the trade war and Trump's pending tax bill will remain in focus, while quarterly results from Nvidia (NVDA) are expected to take center stage on Wednesday after the market close. Reports from Okta (OKTA), Salesforce (CRM), and Costco (COST) will also receive investor attention.



The release of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge on Friday will headline the economic data schedule. Markets will be closed on Monday for Memorial Day.



Tariff escalation

President Trump's policies have continued to drive markets. Concerns over Trump's tax bill boosting the government deficit have pushed Treasury yields higher. At over 5.1%, the 30-year Treasury yield (\^TYX) had been hovering near its highest level since 2007, while the 10-year Treasury yield (\^TNX) had pressed above 4.6%, its highest level since February.



But the sell-off in bonds eased on Friday as Trump once again threatened to escalate tariffs, sending a reminder to investors that even with a 90-day tariff pause on a wide swath of countries, the trade policy whipsaw in markets is far from over.



""Safe to say for the time being we’ve hit 'trough' trade uncertainty,"" Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz wrote in a note to clients on Friday. ""At this point markets need to see these tariffs retracted AND bond yields to not spike again for any material move higher.""



Friday's decline in treasuries sent the 10-year below the key 4.5% level Kantrowitz has been watching. As Kantrowitz highlights in the chart below, once the 10-year Treasury yield has risen above 4.5%, interest rate-sensitive stocks have seen increased underperformance in recent years.



This played out in last week's market action with the Russell 2000 Index (\^RUT), which has many companies with more interest rate exposure than the S&amp;P 500, falling nearly 4% compared to the S&amp;P 500's 2.6% decline.



The AI leader reports

Nvidia is set to report quarterly results on Wednesday after the market close. Investors will be closely watching for any updates on demand from the leading supplier of AI chips. For the quarter, Nvidia is expected to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.88 on revenue of $43.3 billion, according to Bloomberg analyst consensus data. The company reported adjusted EPS of $0.61 on revenue of $26 billion in the same period last year.



Given Nvidia's position as one of the top holdings in the S&amp;P 500, investors will also be watching how the report affects other tech stocks and the broader market. Shares of Nvidia are roughly flat this year after whipsawing amid growing fears of AI competition and tariff concerns.



Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, Nvidia alone has accounted for about 17% of the S&amp;P 500's gains.



Price check

Tariffs have increased fears that inflation could spike again. But there's been little evidence of a resurgence thus far in economic data, and economists expect a similar story to play out in the coming week.



A fresh look at a key inflation measure will come on Friday with the April PCE release. Economists project annual ""core"" PCE — which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.5% in April, down from the 2.6% seen in March. Over the prior month, economists project ""core"" PCE at 0.1%, above the 0% seen the month prior.",94,Aluseda,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kv4ikx/nvidia_earnings_trump_tariff_updates_and_the_feds/,1kv4ikx

**Nvidia Earnings Highlight Slate of Tech, Retail, Financial Reports This Week**

Nvidia is scheduled to report its quarterly earnings on Wednesday. The chipmaking giant recently returned to the $3 trillion market-capitalization level after its share price rallied by around 50% from its April low. The earnings report follows the company’s announcement that it will supply semiconductors to Saudi Arabian AI startup Humain. Nvidia reported 78% year-over-year revenue growth in its prior earnings release. Semiconductor firm Marvell Technology is also scheduled to report this week.

Salesforce’s expected report on Wednesday comes after the cloud software provider reported 8% revenue growth in its prior quarter on the growth of its Agentforce custom AI platform. While the firm delivered a worse-than-expected outlook, analysts said the company had strong potential for growth.

Thursday’s scheduled report from Dell Technologies will show whether the computer maker continues to benefit from increased demand for AI infrastructure after it grew server and networking sales by 37% in the prior quarter. Morgan Stanley recently raised its price target for the company, citing growing server sales momentum on AI demand. Market watchers will also be following computer equipment maker HP’s scheduled report on Wednesday.

Costco Wholesale is on Thursday’s corporate calendar, coming as the membership-based retailer reported that its April sales rose by 7%, which analysts attributed partly to customers rushing purchases ahead of U.S. tariffs. Costco reported a 9% revenue growth in its prior quarter on increased revenue from higher membership fees.

AutoZone’s scheduled report on Tuesday follows an upgrade from Bank of America Securities as analysts argued that higher auto costs from U.S. tariffs could lead to more vehicle repairs by cost-conscious drivers. Dick’s Sporting Goods’ expected report on Wednesday follows its recent deal to acquire sporting goods retailer Foot Locker (FL).

Investors will be watching the scheduled Thursday report from Chinese EV Li Auto, which competes with Tesla (TSLA) sales in that nation. The Tuesday report from PDD Holdings comes as the parent of Chinese-based online retailer Temu faces pressure from U.S. tariffs.

Inflation, GDP, Fed Speakers in Focus

Friday’s scheduled release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index will show how the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation fared in April. A similar inflation reading showed that price increases cooled somewhat in April, and the Fed has said it is closely watching prices in the wake of Trump’s tariffs.

Wednesday’s expected release of the minutes of the May meeting of the FOMC will provide more insight into Fed officials’ deliberations over interest rates and the economy. Likewise, several Fed officials are scheduled to speak during the week, including Fed Gov. Waller, New York Fed President Williams, and San Francisco Fed President Daly.

Revisions to first-quarter GDP are expected on Thursday after the initial report last month showed that the economy shrank in the first three months of 2025.

The state of the consumer will also be in focus for investors, with reports on consumer confidence and consumer sentiment scheduled to be released this week. The reports come as recent surveys show that consumers’ moods have soured over concerns that tariffs will drive prices higher. Friday’s expected reports on the U.S. trade deficit, retail inventories, and wholesale inventories will provide more detail on how U.S. tariffs are affecting the economy. ",67,callsonreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kv2as8/what_to_expect_in_the_markets_this_week_may_2730/,1kv2as8

2025-05-24 23:06:07,r/NVDA_Stock,Analysts Expect First EPS Drop Since 2022!?,"At the beginning of April, the analyst consensus for NVDA’s Q1 EPS was an average of $0.93 per share, up from $0.89 in Q4. NVDA’s EPS has increased QoQ since 2022, when both Q2 and Q3 EPS were $0.03, down from $0.06 in Q1. The image below shows the trend and revisions for analysts’ EPS estimates this quarter. 

https://preview.redd.it/vpd6dgb1ns2f1.png?width=1046&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c36a9bd78437329ddcd30f90f23480551abdfe8

The current average estimate is around $0.73 within a week of the release. **That is a decrease of over 20% from the previous consensus, and calls for NVDA’s first decline in EPS QoQ since 2022.** So what’s causing this massive shift in expectations?

People will quickly cite the $5.5 billion charge “for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves” as the reason for such a drop, **which is completely wrong.** 

The charge will almost certainly be listed as a GAAP Non-Operating Expense, meaning that the Non-GAAP expense segments should be minimally impacted. Headlines report the non-GAAP EPS number, meaning the downward revisions have more to do with the indirect impacts of the China export ban and other trade controls, rather than the direct $5.5 billion charge.

A deeper look into the estimates will show that data center revenue and data center margin have seen the most significant negative revisions. The revisions come in response to the H20 ban, which resulted in a loss of 2 weeks of sales in China, and changed the product mix as a % of sales in the quarter. 

These are two negative impacts on profitability, with sales and margin on those sales both seeing steep declines. However, it appears analysts may be overestimating how much revenue was lost from those two weeks in China, and may have completely misunderstood how margins will be impacted entirely.

According to Business Daily, China sales represented 13% of NVDA’s revenue last year, and the share of sales in China has been trending down. Since 2 weeks of a 13 week quarter is about 15% of the total time, and about 13% of revenue from that two weeks is gone, basic math tells us Data Center Revenue should decrease by roughly 2%. 

My initial estimate was $41.0 billion, and decreasing it by 2% would amount to about $40.2 billion. Analyst consensus is sitting around $38.5 billion according to Nasdaq(dot)com, an increase of only 8.1% QoQ. Below is a graph of Data Center Revenue for the past 11 quarters, shown in blue, with the red point being analyst estimates for the current quarter. 

https://preview.redd.it/afpugci8ns2f1.png?width=1967&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffc146f467cf7ff7a8eaf660ca6c777f97e196af

As for the impact on gross margin, analysts have revised their estimates down due to the shift in product mix without the H20 chips and other China products. 

According to Yahoo Finance, H20 chips were estimated in the 50% range for margins, and their recent strength actually put downward pressure on margins. This means it is unlikely that the new product mix has a significantly lower margin than pre-H20 ban.

The company-issued guidance for gross margin in the current quarter is 71%, with the average analyst now expecting 68.4% according to CMC Markets. 

Since the total revenue average estimate is $43.1 billion, and $38.5 billion is data center revenue, we know the other three segments are estimated to contribute $4.6 billion to total revenue. 

I estimate $4.2 billion from the remaining segments, but a higher gross margin using 71% from company-issued guidance.

So, how much distance is between my estimates and the analysts’ estimates? Well, analysts are currently expecting $43.1 billion in revenue and 68.4% gross margin, while I anticipate at least $44.3 billion and 71% margins. The product of those numbers is the profit before subtracting Operating and Non-Operating Expenses, and dividing by shares outstanding. 

**I have $31.453 billion, while the analyst consensus is $29.48 billion, which is almost $2 billion lower.**

Even if expenses come in higher than the company-issued guidance, analysts have sandbagged expectations going into the print. I expect a massive “surprise” beat on earnings day. 

**Most importantly, a large beat still may not be priced in, even after the pre-earnings rally. The stock is still around the same price it was going into last quarter’s print. If we see QoQ earnings growth beating estimates, I believe investors will take the stock higher, while if this is all a pipe dream and earnings do decline, we could stay rangebound or worse.**

Q2 product revenue guidance of $1.035B–$1.045B implies \~25% growth (from a random SA article I read). Moved close to 20 points from yesterday, watching $200 level. The cloud computing space has essentially exploded due to the rise of AI, I should've seen SNOW would report good earnings mainly because of CRWV's earnings reporting 400% revenue growth. Random risks I'm thinking of in the long term are the stalling of semis production (and even the demand for it), regulatory actions like what happened to NVDA, competition in the data cloud market, etc.

This positions OpenAI to develop a new generation of AI-powered devices and could challenge Apple in the AI space. Stock fell intraday yesterday 2-3%, interested to see if we continue that selloff. Watching the 200 level as well. Apple has essentially fallen flat with AI (Apple Intelligence) and hasn't struck gold recently with any good hardware, we can safely consider the Apple Vision a bust.

Already long from $1700 yesterday, we're down close to 30% on a remark that thinks a $1.50 increase in its wholesale royalty for mortgage originations is too high. The price change is $3.50 to $4.95 per score (which may lead to other companies raising their prices). This is my personal opinion- FICO's probably not going to be phased out for mortgages lol. Too many financial/credit institutions use it.

(Bloomberg) — The Trump administration will maintain efforts to keep advanced artificial intelligence technology out of China’s hands, a top White House official said, brushing off calls from Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to ease restrictions on chip exports to the world’s second largest economy.

“We obviously have huge respect for Jensen,” Sriram Krishnan, White House senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. “When it comes to inside China, I do think there is still bipartisan and broad concern about what can happen to these GPUs once they’re physically inside” the country, he added.

While the Trump administration still sees a security risk from widening AI chip exports to China, Krishnan said it agrees with Huang’s view that restrictions on a wide range of other US trading partners need to be revisited. The Trump administration is rescinding and moving to replace the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that Krishnan said created “GPU haves and GPU have nots.”

“When it comes to the rest of the world, we want American AI stack starting from the GPUs to the models to everything on top,” Krishnan said. “On that, Jensen and I and us are in agreement.”

Krishnan spoke hours after Huang made his most forceful public comments to date against escalating US export restrictions aimed at China. Speaking at the Computex industry conference in Taipei, Huang blasted the measures as a “failure” and urged the US to lower barriers to chip sales in China before American firms cede the market to rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co.

Huang told reporters that China will account for a $50 billion opportunity in 2026. “China has 50% of the world’s AI developers, and it’s important that when they develop on an architecture, they develop on Nvidia, or at least American technology,” he said. Nvidia recently wrote off $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips that had been designed to comply with previous export curbs, but were targeted by a new round of restrictions from the Trump administration this year.

Krishnan pointed to the flurry of projects in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced by American companies during President Donald Trump’s trip to the Middle East last week as evidence of a new effort to ease US allies’ access to AI. He stressed that the agreements would still contain security restrictions to prevent the illegal transfer of advanced technology to China and other adversaries.

“These deals and these GPUs are predominantly going to be run by American hyperscalers, American cloud service providers and American companies,” said Krishnan, who was a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz prior to joining the White House. “Most of these GPUs are going to be run, hosted, controlled by American companies.”",166,callsonreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ks6bjo/us_to_keep_china_chip_curbs_spurning_nvidias_call/,1ks6bjo

2025-05-21 18:04:29,r/NVDA_Stock,The Problem with Expectations,"For an investing forum I am often distressed by the apparent lack of common sense as regards basic maths and how that impacts how folks think about different equities.  For instance, I think a lot of this sub-reddit, and a lot of retail investors in general, expect that NVDA will keep growing at YoY rates well in exceedance of other companies in the sector.

The problem here is that NVDA is already a 3+ TRILLION dollar market cap, so continued growth is going to quickly result in ludicrously large market caps.  But if the growth rate slows, I think the market will punish NVDA for 'underperforming'.  

Here's the numbers.  

I assume a declining CAGR starting with 65% as that's about what it's been over the last five years, and where it is expected to be for 2025 as well.  If I linearly deprecate the CAGR on a quarterly basis to get to 20% CAGR in five years, which would be a HUGE decrease in growth from the last five years, the share price is still going to go to the moon (assuming shares outstanding and P/E ratio is constant).

Linearly deprecating the CAGR has the effect of flattening what is actually an exponential growth curve into what looks like a straight line, but if you look closely you can see that there is a steeper slope early in the chart (higher CAGR) and a shallower slope later in the chart.

I suppose this is a good problem to have.  But the interaction between the animal spirits expecting gonzo numbers each quarter and hard realities of maths are going to come into conflict over the next few years. 

Trying to anticipate the flames...I don't think we're going to see $400/share in 11 quarters...my point is that even a declining CAGR is going to result in really high share prices and that expecting NVDA to continue to grow in almost any way is unrealistic.

Nvidia’s AI Chip Revenue to More Than Double to $262 Billion by 2030, Analyst Says

By Tae Kim, May 20, 2025, 12:55 pm EDT

TD Cowen is growing more optimistic about Nvidia’s ability to dominate the surging AI chip market through the end of the decade.

“We come away from our analysis more constructive on merchant \[GPU\] vendors over custom, and incrementally more confident in the depth and breadth of Nvidia’s competitive positioning,” the Cowen technology team wrote in a report Tuesday.

TD Cowen forecasts the overall market for artificial-intelligence processors—chips such as graphics processing units—will grow from $117 billion in 2024 to $334 billion in 2030. The analysts estimate Nvidia will maintain 90% of the market for GPUs, with revenue from AI chips rising from $100 billion in 2024 to $262 billion in 2030.

Skeptics have said Nvidia would eventually face tougher competition as large technology companies get help from Broadcom and Marvell 

Technology to make better custom AI chips. But over the time through the end of the decade, custom chips’ share of the AI market will rise from 10% to just 15%, Cowen said.

TD Cowen believes Nvidia will maintain its top position, saying custom AI chips will continue to offer less performance than Nvidia’s chips by a “healthy margin.” The chip maker also has the most mature offering of technology across hardware, software, and networking, it says.

“We believe Nvidia’s fully-integrated hardware system approach and robust software suite allow it to demonstrate superior performance in GenAI inference versus competitors,” the analysts wrote.

Competition from custom AI chips produced by Big Tech companies isn’t a new story. Amazon Web Services launched its own custom AI chip in 2019, and Alphabet’s

Google introduced its AI accelerator back in 2015. Both companies have launched several successor versions, but Nvidia has thus far won most of the AI chip business.

“We see Nvidia’s leading technology portfolio, long pedigree of innovation, and extensive growth-oriented investments driving strong accelerator growth in the coming years,” the analysts said.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Haung has quantified the revenue impact of the U.S. government’s latest move to limit chip exports to China: $15 billion.



Last month, the administration effectively banned Nvidia’s H20 chips to China by tightening chip export licensing requirements to the Asian country. At the time, Nvidia said it expected to take a $5.5 billion charge related to inventory and purchase commitments from the new restrictions for its fiscal first quarter.

“This additional ban on Nvidia’s H20 is deeply painful,” Huang said in a Stratechery interview published on Monday. “We walked away from $15 billion of sales and probably—what is it? — $3 billion worth of taxes” for the U.S.

Critics have said offering Nvidia’s artificial-intelligence chips to China—even one or two generations old—can help companies in China catch up to the U.S. in AI technology. Huang disagrees. He believes the restrictions are shortsighted and will, in reality, help China in the long run.

A morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including exclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers.

The restrictions opens the market in China for increased usage of Huawei’s AI chips, he said. If more companies use Huawei’s chips and the Chinese company can refine its software, Nvidia’s current CUDA software advantage could erode.

“Anybody who thought that one chess move to somehow ban China from H20s would somehow cut off their ability to do AI is deeply uninformed,” Huang said. “If we don’t compete in China, and we allow the Chinese ecosystem to build a rich ecosystem because we’re not there to compete for it, and new platforms are developed and they’re not American at a time when the world is diffusing AI technology, their leadership and their technology will diffuse all around the world.”

The executive also argues by limiting access to Nvidia’s products it forces companies to provide financial resources to Huawei, which the company will then use for R&amp;D to compete with Nvidia.",583,thelastsubject123,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kqloim/nvda_expects_15b_loss_in_revenue_due_to_deeply/,1kqloim

MediaTek, Marvell, Alchip Technologies, Astera Labs, Synopsys and Cadence are among the first to adopt NVLink Fusion, enabling custom silicon scale-up to meet the requirements of demanding workloads for model training and agentic AI inference. Using NVLink Fusion, Fujitsu and Qualcomm Technologies CPUs can also be integrated with NVIDIA GPUs to build high-performance NVIDIA AI factories.

“A tectonic shift is underway: for the first time in decades, data centers must be fundamentally rearchitected — AI is being fused into every computing platform,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA.   NVLink Fusion opens NVIDIA’s AI platform and rich ecosystem for partners to build specialized AI infrastructures.”

===

One of the more interesting announcements coming out of Computex is Nvidia is opening up their Nvlink architecture to other chip manufacturers including Mediatek, Marvell and Qualcomm.   The industry stalwarts (AMD, Intel et al) have been trying to push PCI, CXL and other chip to chip communication protocols as de-facto standards.  

Nvidia has had and is having none of it.   Cadence and Synopsis will incorporate NVLink design libraries into their work flows so theoretically it's open to any one who wants it (?).    

The take away here is Nvidia is working to help non-x86 CPU suppliers while ensuring their GPU compute engines remain the center of the AI universe.  They are expanding the Nvidia ecosystem to help second tier guys with open interfaces that work with their chips and software while excluding computation competitors, most notably AMD and Intel GPUs.   It's a strong move to expand beyond ""nvidia exlusive"" type solutions.",59,norcalnatv,https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-nvlink-fusion-semi-custom-ai-infrastructure-partner-ecosystem,1kqeixr
2025-05-19 12:25:45,r/NVDA_Stock,"Will this quarter's earnings be $5.5 billion less due to the ""export control charge""?","I can't find news that make the situation clear. I am getting results like ""Nvidia said it is set to take a $5.5 billion first quarter charge after the u.s. limited exports of its artificial intelligence (ai) chips to China."" or ""up to 5.5B"". I would like to sell some cash secured puts after the Moody's downgrade and dip but don't know how aggressive I could be for a 30 May put, after earnings on 28 May. 23 May is already too close and premiums not good. If it wasn't for the $5.5B charge, I am sure Nvidia would crush earnings estimates by at least $3B(there was an analysis connecting this result to TSMC's sales) and I would sell $125 puts but now I am trying to decide between $120 and $125, I am okay with this prices. If the $5.5B is still on, I could also sell half my puts now and half after earnings. By the way, even though the stock went up, the volume seems lower than average so I am nt sure if instituional investors are all in again or are waiting for another sell off.

2025-05-17 23:37:42,r/stocks,What upcoming data/reports/events to watch out for that could impact the market?,"Could be good or bad. I’m thinking the market will continue trending slightly upwards until negative economic news/data really starts hitting. What I’m watching out for:

Negative:
1. “Liberation day 2” - if 50+ tariff announcements are made in 2-3 weeks
2. Pharmaceutical tariffs (maybe this week)
3. Semiconductor tariffs (maybe in June)
4. If empty store shelves occurs (if it happens probably in June)
5. If countries retaliate against tariffs: retaliatory tariffs (likely at some point), selling US debt like Japan (unlikely near term), halting US goods purchases (like China did with Boeing)
6. Enforcing sanctions against countries (China) getting oil from Iran
7. Effects of decreased tourism/consumers in foreign countries purchasing less American goods like Canadians/federal and private layoffs/loss of consumer spending and labor from deportations/tariff impacts 

Could swing either way
1. Pce report for April
2. June jobs/inflation/manufacturing reports
3. Q2 gdp report (which could indicate recession)
4. 90 day pause on reciprocal tariffs ending - does Trump extend or enact
5. NVDA earnings
6. Fed June meeting (unlikely to cut rates)
7. Fluctuation of value of the dollar

Positive:
1. Trade agreements/foreign countries agreeing to purchase additional US goods

2025-05-14 20:34:42,r/NVDA_Stock,Closed Everything Today including NVDA,"Just like the title says, I hit an all time high today in my portfolio, and historically whenever that's happened, there's been a pullback for me. Earlier this year I saw it go from over 1M down to $600K because of all the things that have been happening, DeepSeek, Tariffs, Chip policies, and a plethora of other things. I stuck through it all, even trading options some weeks like a whirling dervish trying to hold on to my hard earned money that I have invested.   
In the end, all that trading paid off, and while I had several strangles setup from now until November, I woke up today to an all time high account balance significantly higher than the previous ATH, and just thought to myself ""I need some time for a reset, and to get some better positioned shares, options, the whole thing.

It took over 34 trades, covering 349 options contracts, and 9000 shares. Since June of last year I had originally entered with buy prices of $129, $135, and I took some short put assignments as high as $150 in some cases. I heavily traded covered calls, naked calls, short puts, but never really sold the stock much over the year. My average buy price registered in the brokerage as an average of $141 per share.  
After all was said and done, the PnL breakdown was as follows:  
  
Overall PnL +$177,651  
Stock buys and sells -$16,921 loss  
Cash/Margin Secured Puts +$117,377 gain  
Short Call Contracts +$77,195 gain  
  
Just to have a completely clean break, and a new reset, I even closed all my positions in SMCI (+33%) GOOG (+6.5%) SPYD (+1%) and QQQI (+7.4%)

I will keep trading NVDA, but I think I will ease back in. I was a bit over my head for a while, and when the pressure to the downside was on I refused to give up, and had to shift some money from my ""Safe"" account over to bail out the margin calls.

Now, the ""Safe Account"" will stay as is. I mostly have a steady income fund that provides about 10% per year, and a couple of smaller investments in tech funds which incidentally I had bought on April 4th on the big dip. 

It actually feels good to be liberated a bit from trying to keep spinning all those contracts. And even though I had to spend a lot of money today to close those short contracts, it is worth it to feel like I can start again fresh sitting at my own all time high.   
Will I be back in NVDA? You bet! I love trading this beast. First order of business will be to watch for Cash Secured short puts in the next few weeks.

Good luck to all, thanks for reading my post.",283,SB_Kercules,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1kmmsiq/closed_everything_today_including_nvda/,1kmmsiq

This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Deepseek Races After Chatgpt As China's AI Industry Soars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-13/deepseek-races-after-chatgpt-as-china-s-ai-industry-soars)

[**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)\- NVDA is set to ship 18,000 of its advanced GB300 Grace Blackwell AI chips to Saudi Arabia's Humain for a 500 MW data center project. Additionally, the Trump administration is considering a deal that would allow the UAE to purchase over a million NVDA AI chips, easing previous export restrictions. This caused NVDA to skyrocket 10 points yesterday, watching for additional momentum today. Interested if we can make an equivalent move today and if the trend is strong, might buy a little if so- note that NVDA has earnings on 5/28. Overall interesting that NVDA is finding sales outside of China, but not sure if the ME can make up the shortfall.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d)\- TSLA has been on a tear ever since Musk has stepped away from DOGE, going from $275 -&gt; $340 in 5 days. Was watching this since $300, the next major level I'm watching is $350- considering how we exploded upwards after the election, not very enthusiastic to short this unless we go to stupidly high levels like $400+. So for now, biased long. Musk has been controversially politically but the stock performance did hinge on his presence at the company, so interested to see if this is going to blow everyone out of the water shorting it (eg me) like last time lol. 

[**UNH (UnitedHealth Group)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&amp;p=d)\- UnitedHealth Group's CEO Andrew Witty has stepped down, and the company has suspended its 2025 forecast due to higher-than-expected medical costs, leading to a massive selloff yesterday. We dropped close to 70 points yesterday, I was personally hoping for the selloff to reach $300 but ultimately didn't get that far. Bought a little around $310 but will kick this out by selling calls against it because volatility is high. UNH has been through... a lot this year with Luigi and the CEO shooting, the proposed AI to analyze healthcare claims, and now this. We've fallen close to 40% after the *new* CEO stepped down as well. Expecting a small dead-cat bounce and a small slow recovery today, other than that not sure how they're going to navigate out of this.

[**SMCI (Supermicro)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&amp;p=d)\- Supermicro has announced a multi-year $20B partnership with Saudi data center firm DataVolt to deliver GPU platforms and cooling systems for AI campuses in Saudi Arabia and the United States. Made a pretty large 10 point move yesterday, and I want to see if we can make an equivalent move today to see if the trend is strong- interested in the $50 level.

Reuters5 mins ago

(Reuters) -U.S. chip giant Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) and Saudi Arabia announced partnerships on Tuesday as part of the kingdom's plans to develop artificial intelligence and strengthen cloud computing infrastructure with the help of foreign investment.

The deals coincide with U.S. President Donald Trump's Gulf tour, which is focused on economic diplomacy and billion-dollar business tie-ups rather than security concerns.

Saudi Arabia, which is seeking to make its economy less dependent on oil revenue, aims to position itself as a hub for AI and leading centre for AI activity outside the United States.

A joint statement from Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) and Saudi Arabia listed initiatives, including building AI factories and infrastructure and training developers, but did not give financial details.

""It marks a significant step toward positioning the Kingdom as a leader among data- and AI-driven economies,"" said Abdullah bin Sharaf Alghamdi, president of the Saudi Data &amp; AI Authority, the kingdom's Public Investment Fund that focuses on AI.

2025-05-13 16:21:40,r/stocks,"NVIDIA (NVDA) May 13, 2025","

Intraday Trend and Technical Patterns: May 12, 2025 (Monday) NVIDIA shares jumped 5.44% to close at $123.00

Driven by the positive news of the U.S.-China tariff truce, the stock fluctuated in the range of $120.28 to $123.00 on the day's trading session, and the closing price was the highest point of the day, approaching the immediate resistance level of $124.92

Technically, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has risen to 87, indicating that the short-term is in overbought area and may face profit-taking pressure

The volume of the day is about 222 million shares, higher than the weekdays but slightly lower than the recent month's average of 283 million shares, indicating that the participation in this rally is moderate

The 50-day SMA is near $111.50, far below the current share price, verifying the recent strong upward momentum; while the 200-day SMA is about $125.04, slightly higher than yesterday's closing price, which is the highest point of the day. slightly above yesterday's close, implying that the stock is challenging long-term trend resistance

Key Support &amp; Resistance: Technical support is currently around $114 The uptrend remains healthy if pullbacks don't break below this range

In the short term, the $125 neighborhood has become an important resistance level, corresponding to the 200-day SMA and the upper edge of the previous trading range

After opening on May 13, Nvidia shares continued to Nvidia's stock price continued to be strong, up about 2-3%, and at one point during the session broke through the $125 key resistance level (market capitalization). (market capitalization also close to $3 trillion)

The market expects that with the previous day's surge and high RSI, the stock may see a small increase after hitting the resistance level. Resistance may be followed by a small pullback or consolidation to absorb short-term profit-taking

If it manages to hold above $125, it is expected to turn that level into new support and set the stage for further upside; potential targets above include 52-week highs of 153.13

I'm now running the family trust and so know all of my parent's holdings. Anyways I was going through copious amounts of files and yesterday finally took a closer look at a letter my dad wrote to us on 1/15/2007 before a trip they took up the Amazon, in case something bad happened I could start getting at the money. He provided a printout of all his stock and fund holdings and accounts and two positions really stood out. 

3100 shares of NFLX (~$70k)
1600 shares of NVDA. (~$56k)

We don't own either of those in the trust. Sold at some point perhaps years ago definitely before the extreme run-ups of the 2020's. Probably sold after making several hundred thousand or when they didn't move the right direction.

Today these holdings would be 

21,700 shares of NFLX at $1140 = $24.738 million
96,000 shares of NVDA at $116.65 = $11.198 million


Lesson is don't sell unless you absolutely have to and consider selling smaller chunks versus all or nothing.

2025-05-07 19:53:17,r/NVDA_Stock,NVIDIA Real Estate Deals update,"# Nvidia South Bay shopping spree tops $700 million with new property buys [Bay Area News Group]

Tribune Content Agency14 mins ago

SANTA CLARA — Nvidia (NVDA.NaE), buoyed by sky-high profits and sales, has bought more South Bay buildings, a $700 million-plus real estate shopping spree that has given the tech titan a huge local footprint.

In the latest deal, Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) paid $254.3 million to buy three big office and research buildings, all located on San Tomas Expressway in Santa Clara, documents filed on May 6 with the Santa Clara County Recorder’s Office show.

Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) has been expanding its footprint in the South Bay, primarily through property purchases but also through leases.

Santa Clara-based Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) has now plunked down a stunning $747 million in almost precisely a year to buy properties in Santa Clara, where the company has its headquarters, a review of several completed transactions shows.

In every instance, the buildings that Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) has bought over the most recent 53 weeks are across the street or about a block away from the tech titan’s headquarters, a two-building complex with a futuristic look located at 2788 and 2888 San Tomas Expressway.

Here are some of the details of the Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) property purchases over an approximately one-year period. All the buildings are in Santa Clara.

Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) paid:

— $374.3 million in May 2024 for six buildings with addresses of 2770, 2806, 2880 and 2886 Scott Boulevard; 2001 Walsh Avenue; and 2220 Central Expressway.

— $123 million for a May 1, 2025 deal for 10 buildings whose addresses include 2348 and 2350 Walsh.

— $254.3 million to buy three buildings with addresses of 2711, 2721 and 2731 San Tomas in the just-completed May 6 transaction. Real estate legend The Sobrato Organization sold the buildings to Nvidia (NVDA.NaE).

Nvidia’s string of purchases might stretch even further.

In January 2025, Sobrato Organization signed a contract whereby Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) would purchase four buildings on San Tomas.

Although Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) has bought three buildings, according to the property documents, the tech company has yet to purchase a building at 2701 San Tomas. This fourth building was part of the January 2025 agreement between Sobrato and Nvidia (NVDA.NaE).

The four buildings that Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) had agreed to purchase in the January 2025 contract resemble each other and are all the same size.

This means it’s possible that a purchase by Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) of a fourth building owned by Sobrato at this location might be completed at an amount that’s in line the price Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) paid for the three buildings.

Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) also has been leasing some properties of late. The company’s rental deals include Nvidia’s lease of an office and research building at 300 Holger way in San Jose.

The short- and long-term plans that Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) might have for the properties it has bought weren’t immediately certain.

What is certain is that Nvidia’s profits and revenue have skyrocketed.

Over the 12 months that ended in January, Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) earned $72.89 billion on revenue of $130.5 billion, according to the Yahoo Finance site.

The company’s profits and revenue during the most recent one-year period both more than doubled compared to the 12 months that ended in January 2024. Profits zoomed higher by 146%, while revenue soared by 114%.

With this sort of rosy financial picture in view, Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) has hired workers at a brisk pace, according to regulatory documents on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission show.

In January, Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) employed 36,000 people in 38 countries. That was 21.6% more employees than in January 2024, when Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) employed 29,600 people in 36 countries, Nvidia SEC filings show.Nvidia South Bay shopping spree tops $700 million with new property buys \[Bay Area News Group\]",25,norcalnatv,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1kh3tkx/nvidia_real_estate_deals_update/,1kh3tkx

2025-05-07 15:14:53,r/stocks,(05/7) Interesting Stocks Today- China Market Stimulus!,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Xi Fortifies China's Economy Before First Talks On Trade With Us](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-07/xi-fortifies-china-s-economy-before-first-talks-on-trade-with-us)

[**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&amp;p=d)\- Reported Q1 earnings with EPS of $0.62 vs. $0.61 expected and revenue of $5.47B vs. $5.46B expected. AMD mentioned a $1.5B revenue hit due to U.S. chip export restrictions to China, with $800M in costs linked to AI chip curbs. Overall pretty mixed results, stock spiked AH but gave back most of the gains, currently only up 1%. No particular level I'm watching. Overall I see less risk in this (and the other semis) now that most of the major chip companies (ARM reports today) have defined their losses due to the chip restriction- and we have clear defined numbers as to how much a stock will move if they're lifted. Obviously another bad catalyst would be completely stopping all exports, but that seems unlikely at this point.

[**DIS (Disney)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DIS&amp;p=d)\- Reported Q2 EPS of $1.45 vs. $1.21 expected and revenue of $23.6B vs. $23.34B exp. Raised full-year EPS outlook to $5.75, +16% vs. prior guidance. Parks revenue grew 6% to $8.9B. Disney+ added 1.4M subs, hitting $336M in operating profit. I looked into the earnings and interestingly, I think profitability over raw subscriber growth was the spotlight in Disney+. Overall great earnings, which they capped off with softening international parks revenue, then followed it up with a park in Abu Dhabi (lol). Disneyworld generates roughly $10M a day in revenue, so it'll be interesting to see how much a park in Abu Dhabi will cost (10 times more?? /s)

[**SMCI (Super Micro Computer)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&amp;p=d)\- Issued weak guidance post-earnings, citing “economic uncertainty and tariff impacts.” EPS of 0.31 vs .50 exp, revenue of $4.60B vs. $5.42B expected. Ever since the spike back in February, this stock has essentially been (relatively) non-volatile, still watching $30 level. SMCI's server business is essentially linked to AI/data center build-outs- but this stock hasn't been moving that much with tech companies announcing greater AI spend. Accounting issues could return (highly unlikely), tariffs get worse, etc.

[**PLTR (Palantir Technologies)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&amp;p=d)\- Currently holding a short position due to the stock's massive run up to 125. Stop set at 115 (near yesterday’s high), earnings were released on Monday. I kind of see a similar pattern that came when NVDA was trading near $140 in this stock: (NVDA obviously has better fundamentals than PLTR) but we had a massive run up, earnings that were excellent but still couldn't live up to the hype, and a subsequent selloff. For now, nothing has really changed my mind about covering my short unless we have a massive turn. Government spending cuts are the main risk for the company.",6,WinningWatchlist,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kgx2ai/057_interesting_stocks_today_china_market_stimulus/,1kgx2ai

They’re slapping 10-15% tariffs on stuff like chips, iPhones, and even some cloud services, hitting names like Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft hard. EU’s calling it “supporting local innovation,” but it smells like a cash grab to me.Here’s what I’m chewing on:

* AAPL’s already got thin margins on hardware. Tariffs could force price hikes or eat profits—either way, stock takes a hit, right?
* NVDA’s GPU dominance might not care about EU rules, but if China retaliates with their own tariffs (they’re already rumbling), supply chains could get messy.
* Smaller players like AMD or QCOM might feel the pain faster than the big dogs. Anyone holding these?

I’m not seeing much buzz about this on X or here, but markets don’t always price in risks like this right away. Are we all too busy chasing AI pumps or TSLA’s next tweet to care? Or is this just noise that’ll blow over?Curious what you all think. I’m holding some AAPL and NVDA but wondering if I should trim or grab puts for a hedge.

&gt; Now, the semiconductor industry faces a reckoning with President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. While smartphones, computers, memory chips and several other categories of products are currently spared from tariffs, some exemptions could be reversed in coming weeks as part of an investigation into semiconductors.
&gt; 
&gt; “Imposing tariffs and blocking things, I think it’s moving backward,” Suss MicroTec Chief Executive Burkhardt Frick said in an interview.
&gt; 
&gt; President Trump in April slapped tariffs on dozens of nations, then relented with a 90-day suspension for most countries following market turmoil, allowing leaders to reach out for trade deals. However, Washington excluded Beijing from the 90-day pause and imposed tariffs amounting to 145%, prompting China to retaliate with duties on U.S. imports of 125%.
&gt; 
&gt; “Even this 90-day pause is just buying time, while the two big elephants in the room are still provoking each other,” Frick said. “I think nobody will benefit. It’s a zero-sum game.”
&gt; 
&gt; An industry veteran with more than 30 years’ experience, Frick spent around two decades working in Philips’ mobile display and semiconductor business before joining Dutch semiconductor-equipment maker ASML Holding in 2014 as vice president of strategic sourcing and supply chain. He took the reins of Suss MicroTec in 2023.

---

&gt; Now, the company is getting a broader mix in what Frick called a helpful development because if one area loses some momentum, the company still has other product groups to sustain growth.
&gt; 
&gt; “Of course, a global recession would help nobody, and that’s what everybody is concerned about,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; While appetite for semiconductors to power the data centers and servers behind the AI boom continues to thrive, the industry has been agonizing for more than a year over weak demand for legacy chips found in cars and industrial machinery.
&gt; 
&gt; Some chip makers, like Tesla supplier STMicroelectronics, are signaling that a recovery might be on the way, but tariffs or export controls could jeopardize the complex supply chains that the industry has relied upon for decades and potentially raising prices for consumers, Frick said.
&gt; 
&gt; “Would you pay $3,000 or more for an iPhone? Because that will be the result and that’s just one gadget and this will go across the industry,” Frick said. “That will really trigger a global recession and I think nobody wants that.”

---

It seems like the market has collective amnesia about the upcoming semiconductor tariffs. How should we play this? I imagine the currently excluded product categories will be swept up under this new separate tariff regime, such as smartphones. 

Do we expect this to stack on top of other tariffs for categories that didn't receive exclusions from the retaliatory tariffs?

2025-05-04 15:22:13,r/stocks,Why I am extremely bullish,"I know this may contradict prevailing sentiment but I hope you can at least hear me out. I’ve been buying the tariff dip on margin, with $1.4 million invested in blue chip stocks. I’m up 46% in the past month. My largest buys have been in TSM, NVDA, ORCL, CAVA, AMZN, MSFT, META &amp; SMH.

1. Largest tax cut in history is coming. Republicans own the house and senate, and Trump is deadset on cutting taxes by $5 trillion. Obviously not good for the national debt but that will juice the economy big time. 

2. Midterms are coming in 2026, and Trump will not want to have a recession on his hands which would risk him loosing the house and senate. I am fully convinced he launched this tariff war so early on, so he could get it over with before midterms. Trump has pivoted extremely quickly on all reciprocal tariffs aside from china. And he is desperate to start negotiations with china. China and the U.S have both entered a de escalatatory tone, with both sides  making exemptions to tariffs, china expressing willingness to deal with fentanyl, and acknowledging the desire to negotiate- along side acknowledging that the U.S has reached out to them. They are BOTH eager to water down these tariffs and deep down, when both parties want the same thing (reduced tariffs) they will find a way to get it despite all the public bluster. Even if a deal could take months, they will likely have a pause either during or before negotiations. 


3. Rate cuts are coming later this year. It’s likely there will be at least 2 rate cuts before year’s end assuming tariff inflation does not cause extreme inflation. Rate cuts will boost the ability to borrow capital, increase liquidity and stimulating the economy. 

4. We are at the dawn of the largest productivity revolution in history. Everyone has seemed to forget about AI despite big tech earnings and guidance blowing it out of the park. MSFT, GOOG, and META are printing money, and AI is showing incredible returns in the semiconductor and data center space. We are still in the early stages of AI, the smarter it gets the more productivity will increase. 

5. The economy is currently strong. Jobs numbers in April (not a lagging indicator) were impressive. At the end of the day, so long as people are not losing their jobs the U.S consumer will stay resilient. Tariff effects could disrupt that if they stay in effect long term. However I think it’s pretty obvious the worst of the tariffs are temporary. 

6. U.S exceptionalism is nowhere close to ending. We are miles ahead of every other economy in terms of innovation and technology. We lead in services, and nobody is boycotting GOOG, META, MSFT etc in a significant way. These innovative tech companies exist nowhere else in scale and success. Our consumer is 30% of the global economy and nowhere do they have such a wealthy large pool of consumers. We are still the world reserve currency with 59% of currency held abroad is dollars. And nobody, even Trump will let us lose that reserve currency status.",0,Jshbone12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kejoo0/why_i_am_extremely_bullish/,1kejoo0

My theory is that China isn’t behind us in the AI at all. As a matter of fact, they could more likely be ahead of us. 

Check these out: https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/china-worlds-fastest-flash-memory-device

Jensen Huang came forward and warned us about the significant strides China is making in AI. He looked shaken up when addressing it on television. 

About a month ago or so around the time the conflict between the US and China began with chip restrictions I noticed somebody on an option flow had placed a trade for NVDA to drop significantly and I wondered why. Since then over $1B has been paid in Put premiums. For a while I thought it would be stricter tariffs on Semiconductors or losing market share in China (which are both still significant factors) but if what I’ve read is true then what the Chinese have the ability to do is restructure how AI data centers operate completely. 

Ultimately if we’ve cut ourselves off from them with the intention of making access to our tech more restricted, but they can do what we can do more efficiently overall and capitalize on Nvidias lost market share in China it will send the market into a frenzy the same way DeepSeek did. And that’s what everybody is betting on. Otherwise there is $1Billion in donation money just waiting to the expiry dates to hit. 

At least I think so.

2025-05-02 17:25:55,r/NVDA_Stock,Nvidia is working on new products for China,"# Nvidia is working on China-tailored chips again after US export ban, The Information reports

Reuters9:14 AM ET May-02-2025

(Reuters) - Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) has told some of its biggest Chinese customers that it is tweaking the design of its artificial intelligence chips so they can be sold to Chinese businesses without clashing with U.S. export rules, The Information reported on Friday.

The chip giant has spoken with customers, including Alibaba Group (BABA.NaE), TikTok-parent ByteDance and Tencent Holdings (TCTZF.NaE), the report said, citing three people involved in the conversations.

Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) CEO Jensen Huang alerted customers about his plans while on his trip to Beijing, according to the report. Huang's Beijing trip in mid-April came days after the U.S. government limited exports of its H20 AI chips to China.

The export curbs on the primary chip Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) was legally permitted to sell in China would result in charges of $5.5 billion for the company, it had then said.

Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) has told customers that a sample of the new chip will be available as soon as June, The Information reported. The company also said it was still working on a China-specific version of its latest-generation AI chip, Blackwell, according to the report.

Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) declined to comment on the report. ByteDance, Alibaba (BABA.NaE), Tencent (TCTZF.NaE) and the U.S. Commerce Department did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

The sale of Nvidia's (NVDA.NaE) advanced AI chips to China - a key market for the company - has been a contentious topic, with U.S. officials moving to restrict the flow of the most powerful chips to China to keep ahead in the AI race.

Following those restrictions, the company began designing chips tailored for China that would come as close as possible to U.S. limits.Nvidia is working on China-tailored chips again after US export ban, The Information reports",73,norcalnatv,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1kd3qql/nvidia_is_working_on_new_products_for_china/,1kd3qql
2025-05-02 15:35:15,r/NVDA_Stock,NVDA eyes a breakout,"Nvidia ($NVDA) is trading in a tight zone, but options positioning hints at a possible pop. Today’s key level is $113. If the stock holds above that mark into the close, it could clear the path for further upside.

Just take a look at the notional value stacked around $113 in puts—over $35 million in premium sitting there, according to the chart. That’s one of the largest put walls on the board. If NVDA stays above $113, those bearish bets start to fizzle. Market makers and hedgers might unwind protective positions, potentially releasing more buying pressure into next week.

Meanwhile, there’s a big spike in call value sitting at the $115 strike. That could act like a magnet if momentum picks up. The $115 level has over $60 million in call notional value—easily the largest on the chart.

Institutions seem to be leaning bullish here, or at least expecting a move higher. If the $113 wall collapses, $NVDA could chase that call-heavy zone above $115 in the coming days.

Feels like one of those inflection points—either NVDA holds and rips, or it wobbles and the short-term upside fades. But right now, the setup favors the bulls.",135,reseamatsih,http://blog.oqliv.com/post/nvda-eyes-a-breakout-2025-5-2,1kd140u

2025-05-02 04:21:01,r/NVDA_Stock,Here’s why Huawei’s competition to Nvidia is NOT surprising.,"As someone who works in hardware, huawei has been a major player in tech and has been producing cutting edge products for a while now. It comes to me as no surprise that they are making half decent GPUs as well now. 

First off let me start with some technicals and make things clear. Huawei is a generation behind in chips, but its scale-up solution is arguably a generation ahead of Nvidia and AMD’s current products on the market. So what would be the specifications for Huawei’s CloudMatrix 384 (CM384)? The CloudMatrix 384 consists of 384 Ascend 910C chips connected through an all-to-all topology. The tradeoff is simple: having five times as many Ascends more than offsets each GPU being only one-third the performance of an Nvidia Blackwell.

Here’s how it compares ago NVDIA’s offering:

The CM384 is that it takes 4.1x the power of a GB200 NVL72(NVDIA’s flagship) with 2.5x worse power per FLOP, 1.9x worse power per TB/s memory bandwidth, and 1.2x worse power per TB HBM memory capacity.

Simply put Nvidia chips are more powerful and more efficient but if push comes to shove and the Chinese simply don’t have access to Nvidia chips they can make do with Huawei chips as well. 


A couple of factors to consider:

1. Huawei is basically banned in much of western world so people don’t get to try their tech but fact is it’s pretty good. I tried the huawei mate pro and on the hardware level alone it’s probably the best out there. Remember the whole Huawei 5G fiasco? They were one of the first companies to introduce 5G in mass. We never got to see it cause it was banned over security concerns. 

2. China is a country of a billion people that produces more engineers than US. So from a numbers game alone they are bound to have some great engineers. Since, 2016 a lot highly educated Chinese started going back to China and adding to the talent pool there. This has been reflected in the progress the have made in last 8 years.

3.  The Chinese government is very serious about technology spend and has been funding research and development of high tech projects since last 8 years. Think of it as the CHIPS act on steroids.

4. Also, remember Huawei is a much bigger company than NVDA despite basically only operating in China there revenue is 110bn USD in comparison to 61bn of NVDA for 2024. So they have a lot of cash to invest in research and development more than AMD or Intel. 
&gt;As of 2024, more than half of Huawei’s employees are involved in research.  In the same year, Huawei spent $22.1 billion on R&amp;D, around 22.4% of its net sales, being one of the six companies in the world to spend more than $20 billion on R&amp;D spending.In recent years, Huawei has prioritized technological innovation as a means of vertically integrating its supply chain, particularly in to areas vulnerable to sanctions

I personally had the bias that it would actually be bullish for the company, so I'll likely trade a second move rather than the first if I'm at the computer for the trade.

When the 2020 pandemic crash happened, I was 21 and had some money, so I started looking into investing. I was a complete rookie and an idiot, thinking that I was good at choosing companies when it was just a ridiculous bull market, and after coming out on a small plus side, I let go of the market for a very long time.

In February of this year, my father suddenly passed away. As we were going through his accounts and our family assets, we realized he was quite good with money, and alongside his monthly pension that will be given to my mother, we learned that we were going to be well off. After careful calculation, my mother decided to keep the pension, and one third of my father's assets. I was given around two thirds of the assets, which came out to roughly 280,000$.

I'm from Korea, and for my entire life, always dreamed of moving to the States for a high paying job, but never had the money to get the education in order to do so. Now I do.

After crunching the numbers, I've decided to put aside 80,000$ to pay for my living costs, tuition costs to prepare for my education in the States, and for some traveling. This will keep me fairly comfortable until the end of 2028. Which leaves 200,000$ for me to invest in, in order to build up my net worth for my time studying in America, before finally getting a job.

Then Trump announced the tariffs, and I started to reconsider everything.

Thankfully, I was mostly cash when the market went down, and afterwards I had invested  up to 50,000$ back into the market. Mostly focusing on either dividend heavy companies or ETF's like VOO, SCHD, KO, PEPCO, and powerhouse tech companies like NVDA, AMZN, MSFT, and other sectors, as well as companies in other countries.

My issue now is whether to wait for the doom mindset that so many people seem to have about the current US administration and the market to take full effect and tank everything, or do I just DCA into the company roster that I made for the next few months, and just let the market do its thing for the next 3 to 4 years. I know that timing the market is stupid, and even if you time it perfectly, it's so stressful anyways. I kinda just want to invest and not think about it constantly.

SMCI attributed the shortfall to delayed customer platform decisions and higher inventory reserves from older generation products. We're close to 20% down and with all the negative news on semi competition from China and server costs, I'm looking to play a bounce in this if the selloff gets worse. No real level I'm watching, likely will move with the market today. SMCI cited that inventory is increasing and as a result affected NVDA/DELL afterhours as well. DELL is down 6%! Potential supply chain disruptions like tariffs continue to be the biggest risk.

Jamie Dimon said that a recession is a ""best case scenario"", ultimately looking at how bad the selloff will be today. The broader market is grappling with uncertainties stemming from trade tensions and tariff implementations, and the contraction news. Might take a minor VXX long as well 

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)\- DeepSeek released its Prover-V2-671B model on Hugging Face, a 671B parameter AI model trained on Huawei’s Ascend 910B chips. Obviously bad if Deepseek can release a competitive model that wasn't built on NVDA's chips like last time. This was also affected by SMCI news, so I'm interested in this today if we near $100 near the open.

[**SNAP (Snap Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNAP&amp;p=d)\- Snap reported Q1 2025 revenue of $1.36B vs. $1.35B expected, with a net loss of $140M, narrowing from the previous year. Daily active users reached 460 million, slightly above expectations. However, the company declined to provide Q2 guidance, citing macroeconomic uncertainties. Interested in this below $7, otherwise not interested mainly due to all the other things going on today. The digital advertising sector faces challenges due to changing trade policies and economic uncertainties, impacting revenue streams for advertising. Ultimately can be a huge loser if tariffs/recession goes through.

2025-04-30 14:44:30,r/stocks,US Economy Contracts for First Time Since 2022 on Imports Surge,"&gt;The US economy contracted at the start of the year for the first time since 2022 on a monumental pre-tariffs import surge and softer consumer spending, a first snapshot of the ripple effects from President Donald Trump’s trade policy.

&gt;Inflation-adjusted gross domestic product decreased an annualized 0.3% in the first quarter, well below average growth of about 3% in the prior two years, according to the government’s initial estimate published Wednesday. Net exports subtracted nearly 5 percentage points from GDP, the most on record, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed.

&gt;Consumer spending — which accounts for two-thirds of GDP — advanced at a 1.8% pace, the weakest since mid-2023. Business outlays for equipment, the lone bright spot in the report, increased an annualized 22.5%.

|Indicator|Actual|Estimate|
|:-|:-|:-|
|GDP|\-0.3%|\-0.2%|
|Personal consumption|\+1.8%|\+1.2%|
|PCE price index, excl. food, energy|\+3.5%|\+3.1%|

&gt;The GDP data highlight the scramble by companies to secure merchandise ahead of expansive tariffs. Looking ahead, many economists anticipate the higher duties will cause a supply shock, challenging businesses and leading to a pullback in demand as higher prices push cash-strapped Americans closer to the brink.

&gt;Forecasters currently see nearly even odds of the US falling into a recession in the next year. Consumers are also growing increasingly anxious that tariffs will take a toll on the labor market and drive up the cost of living.

&gt;The latest GDP figures showed imports surged an annualized about 41% — the biggest advance in nearly five years. Because these goods and services aren’t produced in the US, they are subtracted from GDP. Economists see the sharp widening of the trade deficit reversing in the second quarter.

&gt;Typically, imported merchandise moves into warehouses or directly to storefronts. However, the report showed business inventories contributed 2.25 percentage points to GDP during the quarter, the most since the end of 2021. The recent flood imports may instead show up in higher inventories in coming months and, along with a narrowing trade gap, provide a lift to second-quarter GDP.

&gt;Because swings in trade and inventories can sometimes distort overall GDP, economists prefer looking at final sales to private domestic purchasers for a better snapshot of demand. This measure increased at a 3% pace in the first quarter after rising an annualized 2.9% at the end of 2024.

&gt;Growth in consumer spending was driven by services and nondurable goods.

**My take:** As is commonly said, we haven't even begun to feel the effects of Trump's trade policy yet- shortages of products haven't begun hitting American consumers, but we're going to start feeling the effects this summer. We're likely in for a painful day in the markets today.

I'm mainly interested in consumer discretionary companies to day trade (SBUX mainly) and also watching tech names like SMCI (earnings), NVDA/DELL/AMD (off of the new Deepseek news).

Reuters3:17 PM ET Apr-29-2025

By Karen Freifeld

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The Trump administration is working on changes to a Biden-era rule that would limit global access to AI chips, including possibly doing away with its splitting the world into tiers that help determine how many advanced semiconductors a country can obtain, three sources familiar with the matter said.

The sources said the plans were still under discussion and warned they could change. But **if enacted, removing the tiers could open the door to using U.S. chips as an even more powerful negotiating tool in trade talks.** 

   The regulation, which was issued in January, is aimed at dividing up access to the most advanced AI chips and controlling certain model weights in order to keep the most sophisticated computing power in the United States and among its allies, and away from China and other countries of concern. 

The Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, as the rule is called, was issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce in January, a week before the end of the administration of former President Joe Biden. Companies must comply with its restrictions starting on May 15.

Currently, the rule has the world divided into three tiers. Seventeen countries and Taiwan in the first tier can receive unlimited chips. Some 120 other countries are in the second tier, which leaves them subject to caps on how many AI chips they can get. And countries of concern like China, Russia, Iran and North Korea in the third tier are blocked from the chips.

But Trump administration officials are weighing discarding the tiered approach to access in the rule and replacing it with a global licensing regime with government-to-government agreements, the sources said.

""There are some voices pushing for elimination of the tiers,"" Wilbur Ross, who served as Commerce secretary during the first Trump administration, said in an interview on Tuesday. ""I think it's still a work in progress."" He said government-to-government agreements were one alternative.

Such a structure would likely tie in to President Donald Trump's broader trade strategy of making deals with individual countries, one of the sources said. That would make it easier for the U.S. to use access to American-designed chips as leverage in other negotiations.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at a conference in March that he wants to include export controls in trade talks.

Other possible changes include a lower threshold for an exception to licensing. Under the current rule, orders under the equivalent of about 1,700 of Nvidia's (NVDA.NaE) powerful H100 chips do not count toward country caps and only require the government be notified about the order. No license is necessary.

The Trump administration is considering making the cutoff orders under the equivalent of 500 H100 chips, one source said.

A spokesperson for the Commerce Department declined comment. A spokesperson for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

For months, Trump administration officials have suggested they want to make the rule ""stronger but simpler,"" but at least some experts believe removing the tiers will make the rule more complicated.

Ken Glueck, executive vice president at Oracle, a critic of the current rule, said that the tiers did not make sense, noting that Israel and Yemen were both in the second tier. 

""Wouldn't surprise me they're going to take a new look at this,"" said Glueck, who said he did not know the Trump administration's plan but expects the rule to be modified in a significant way. 

Oracle and Nvidia (NVDA.NaE) were both outspoken in their criticism of the new rule when it was issued in January.

Industry has argued that by limiting access to the chips, countries will buy the technology from China. Some U.S. lawmakers have agreed. Seven Republican senators sent a letter to Lutnick in mid-April asking for the rule to be withdrawn.

The restrictions would incentivize buyers, especially in Tier 2 countries, to turn to China's ""unregulated cheap substitutes,"" the letter said.",110,norcalnatv,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1kayk0i/trump_admin_wants_to_hold_out_on_gpus_for/,1kayk0i

2025-04-27 03:27:45,r/NVDA_Stock,Nvidia Sacrifices Profits To Preserve Revenues In The U.S.,"In response to escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Nvidia's is making the strategic decision to shift manufacturing of its AI supercomputers to the United States to mitigate the impact of tariffs and export controls on Nvidia's operations.

&gt;**Moreover, Nvidia can charge full price – and perhaps even a premium – for a crippled H20 compared to an H100 or H200, and thus the H20 should be a more profitable device to sell.**

Nvidia's DGX GB200 NVL72 supercomputer, a complex system comprising over 600,000 components and consuming 120 kilowatts of power, is central to this strategy. Given that most customers for these machines are based in the U.S., manufacturing them domestically becomes a logical step. However, Nvidia does not intend to build and operate its own factories. Instead, it plans to commission partners to establish manufacturing facilities in the U.S., ensuring that components and systems are produced domestically to meet demand and comply with trade regulations.​

&gt;Just like TSMC had to sacrifice some profits to move manufacturing to the United States, we believe that Nvidia will do so as well. And as Nvidia’s financials show – the company had $130.5 billion in sales and net income of $72.88 billion, a whopping 55.8 percent of revenues, in fiscal 2025 – it can do anything it damned well wants to, including building its own real factories. Anything, of course, except not obey the laws in the countries in which it does business.

This strategic shift follows reports of a meeting between Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and President Trump, where discussions likely included the H20 GPU accelerator—a modified version of the H100 GPU designed to comply with U.S. export restrictions. The H20, with slightly reduced specifications, is tailored for the Chinese market, allowing Nvidia to maintain a presence there despite regulatory challenges.​",100,Yafka,https://www.nextplatform.com/2025/04/16/nvidia-sacrifices-profits-to-preserve-revenues-in-the-us/,1k8shnw

2025-04-23 17:38:06,r/stocks,"Change my mind: Holding cash is foolish, you should be DCAing","I can't believe I need to be saying this, but the discussions here in this subreddit has led me to believe I am being gaslit, people here are young investors with no notion of being long-term investors, or maybe I'm the  fool that's only been in the market for 8 years so I'm the guy who has no idea what I'm talking about. If it's the latter of the three, feel free to correct me.

For the past weeks I have seen so many people saying they are holding cash because they point out it's plainly and clearly obvious that in the coming months tariffs will finally take effect and that's when the true hurt will begin. The stock market is still overpriced. The V shape recovery after a crash is a lie this time! A true recession is where stocks will be down for years. Europe hasn't even retaliated yet. The true people who are 20+ aged investors and lived through 2008 know it's time to hold cash and wait. Even Warren Buffet is holding cash!

All pure speculation in my view. If I asked you right now what Trump's next move is, what Xi Jinping's next move it, if there will be a trade deal between USA and China, if Trump is backing down now due to advisors, can you answer any of these with certainty? Can you also tell me that when GOOG, NVDA, UBER, META, AMZN, XOM, etc all report earnings they will tank rather than go up and bring the markets up? Where exactly is the market bottom?

Just stop. Just like how today I can't tell you we are going back to a bull market with reaching ATH by the end of the year because we just had two massive days of rallies and Trump saying he is going to be soft on China with reports that his advisors were shitting the bed about the economy, you equally can't call the opposite about bull traps or whatever. What I can tell you is that you just missed a bunch of blue-chip stocks that were trading for one of their most undervalued prices ever. You should have been buying a week ago, you should be buying now, you should be DCAing stocks you have conviction in until they reach a price you believe is overvalued and you find a better opportunity in another.

2025-04-23 15:09:57,r/stocks,"Interesting Stocks Today (04/23) - Trump plans to be ""very nice"" to China!","Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Trump Says He'll Be Very Nice To China In Trade Talks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-23/trump-says-he-ll-be-very-nice-to-china-in-trade-talks)

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d)\- Reported Q1 earnings with EPS of $0.27 vs. $0.39 expected and revenue of $19.34B vs. $21.11B expected. Total revenue declined 9% year-over-year, with automotive revenue dropping 20% to $14B. Net income fell 71% to $409M, or $0.12 per share. The company attributed the decline to factory retooling for the refreshed Model Y, lower average selling prices, and increased sales incentives. That was a brutal earnings report, yet Trump announcing that he'll be nice to China saved the stock and pushed the entire market up. Interested in $275 and $250 levels.

[**SPY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&amp;p=d) **/** [**QQQ**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&amp;p=d) **/** [**VXX**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&amp;p=d) **/ China Stocks** / **Tech Stocks**\- President Trump signaled a potential substantial reduction in China tariffs, which currently stand at 145%. Whether this will actually hold and be his stance going forward is entirely up to him (he changed his mind a lot during 2019's trade wars). Assuming that the market holds up today, I'm primarily watching my current positions in NVDA/AAPL and ready to flip short if we make some ridiculously unsustainable move or if Trump changes his mind.

[**LLY (Eli Lilly)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LLY&amp;p=d)\-Filed lawsuits against four telehealth companies for selling unauthorized compounded versions of its GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. (LLY's diabetes drug Mounjaro went into short supply in 2022, allowing pharmacies and outsourcing facilities to produce the treatment, a practice called compounding). These drugs generated over $16.4B in revenue last year. Interestingly enough I see this case as pretty major despite not moving the stock significantly today, deciding whether GLP-1 is essentialy ""genericized"" to the point where any company can sell it or only the original developers of the drug. NVO might face the same thing in the future. If LLY loses, that's a huge blow for both of them.

[**HTZ (Hertz)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HTZ&amp;p=d)\-The potential rollback of tariffs by the Trump administration could negatively impact Ackman's thesis that used cars are more valuable due to tariffs. The stock is nearing $9, the previous high when the tariff news was announced. I'm interested in shorting the stock if we make a parabolic move up or if we fail to break $9 (but as always, it's dependent on how we get there). Automotive rental companies have benefited from higher used car values amid tariff-induced supply constraints.

2025-04-20 23:58:02,r/NVDA_Stock,It’s just starting,"been tracking Nvidia closely, and while I expect a pullback to the low $60s range in the short term, I’m firmly long on this stock and expect it to finish the year around $175. Here’s why:

1. AI Is Not a Trend , It’s the Future
Nvidia is the essential infrastructure player in the AI revolution. Every major tech company building large-scale AI models is using NVDA’s GPUs. As AI adoption scales globally – in medicine, autonomous vehicles, financial services, cloud platforms – Nvidia will continue to dominate the market. Their moat isn’t just deep – it’s widening.

2. Jensen Huang Is a Visionary
Let’s not underestimate the importance of leadership. Huang isn’t just a CEO – he’s a tech visionary. He’s always been three steps ahead: pivoting to AI before it was cool, investing in software stacks and ecosystems (CUDA, Omniverse, etc.), and constantly reinvesting in innovation. In a sector where execution is everything, I trust him.

3. The Macro Environment Will Settle by Summer
There’s a lot of noise right now – rates, elections, geopolitical drama – but by summer, the fog will lift. I expect the market to calm down once the Trump legal drama reaches its conclusion and election narratives settle into predictable patterns. That stability will bring back institutional risk-on sentiment, especially toward high-growth tech.

Bottom Line
Short term: yes, NVDA could touch the low $60s. I’ll be adding there.
Long term: I see $175+ by year-end as macro headwinds fade and AI adoption continues to surge.

Nvidia isn’t a trade , it’s a conviction play.

2025-04-20 21:43:00,r/NVDA_Stock,"Trade War?! NVDA Q1 FY26 Earnings, Revenue, and Guidance First Estimates","Last quarter, I posted a written analysis explaining how I calculated my estimates for NVDA’s Q4 Earnings Report. Some things went well, and some line items could be improved. With over a month until the next report and a recent bombshell SEC Filing, I am publishing my first estimates for NVDA’s Q1 FY26 Earnings, Revenue, and Guidance. These estimates will likely change following earnings from companies like AMD, MSFT, META, AMZN, and GOOGL, which all come before NVDA. Immediately below is a graph that visualizes Q4’s accuracy compared to analyst consensus and the actuals.

Q4 Results and Variance:  
Revenue: Actual: $39.33B, Consensus: $38.1B (-3.23%), My Est: $40.65B (+3.25%)  
EPS: Actual: $0.89, Consensus $0.85 (-4.49%), My Est: $0.88 (-1.12%)  
Guidance: Actual $43B, Consensus $42B (-2.33%), My Est: $42B (-2.33%)

At the time of writing, NVDA’s [8-K](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001045810/9e6e2d94-83a7-465c-8a94-982d82e3e9e7.pdf) submitted to the SEC on April 15th, 2025, has had the greatest impact on NVDA’s Q1 earnings estimates. An 8-K filing, in a nutshell, is a requirement to disclose information promptly to investors so they can consider it in their investment decisions. Without these filings, investors may buy into a company going through hardships that are not reported until the next earnings call, which could be months away. The analysis will cite this filing when relevant to making estimates.

The next section will look to analyze NVDA’s four main revenue segments. While Data Center (DC) accounts for just over 90% of total revenue, they have three other segments with quarterly revenue over $0.5B. Gaming accounts for the majority of the remaining revenue share; last quarter, it reported $2.5B in revenue. Added to $35.6B in Data Center, and those two segments represent $38.1B of the reported $39.33B. Two more segments, Professional Visualization and Robotics &amp; Auto, combined for just over $1B last quarter, and their continued success could boost the headline number.

[Reddit Formatting Made This One Crammed :\(](https://preview.redd.it/nnla6o5mf1we1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86026692c4770f34c696ddd8b9e446604dacb485)

The above graph shows the quarterly revenue (billions, USD) for Data Centers and the quarter-over-quarter growth rate in percent, going back to the start of 2023. Note that the graph uses Calendar Year, meaning this would be FY2024 for NVDA. I tracked three possible trajectories for the upcoming quarter, ranging from a continued slowdown to a re-acceleration.

However, given the aforementioned 8-K filing, reacceleration seems unlikely. NVDA learned they can no longer sell their H20 chip to China and stated they will incur a \~$5.5B charge in Q1, “for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves.” The filing implies the impact on Q1 total revenue will be small, as the end of the quarter comes less than two weeks after the news. Given this small but material impact on sales in Q1, the red path seems the most likely. Initially, a slight reacceleration in YoY growth seemed possible, but now the calculation uses a more conservative growth rate, estimating $41.0B.

Investors will shift their focus to other metrics like gross margin and possibly GAAP earnings to visualize the impact. This analysis will continue to prioritize Non-GAAP reporting, as historically, investors have preferred using these calculations to value NVDA’s business. The $5.5B charge will likely fall under GAAP Non-Operating Expenses, and will almost certainly be excluded from Non-GAAP expense reporting. As for its impact on the revenue section of the analysis, there is minimal change aside from potential data center revenue lost in the final two weeks of the accounting period.

TSMC’s most recent earnings report on April 17th provided some relief for investors after the company reported strong earnings and revenue in Q1. More importantly, TSMC did not lower its full-year revenue guidance despite the challenging macroenvironment. CNBC outlines some challenges TSMC may face in this [article](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/17/tsmc-first-quarter-profit-tops-estimates-rising-60percent-as-trump-trade-policy-threatens-growth-.html), so maintaining guidance was positive news. Shares were up approximately 3% in the following trading session. The strong earnings and steady guidance support the claim that NVDA is continuing to benefit from the continued AI demand surge and support the claim that navigating the current macroenvironment is possible. Given Jensen Huang’s track record of strong leadership over 30 years and NVDA’s strong position in the industry, they are well-positioned to endure uncertainty.

https://preview.redd.it/g1lgo0quf1we1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b3fdd0733f9909a4efe49b1e17e4a1332d5e7f0

TSMC’s revenue growth is cyclical, with Q1 experiencing negative growth QoQ at all three points on the graph. Compared to previous years, however, Q1 2025 saw a smaller drop than 2024 in total percentage terms, and the growth rate overall is the highest (least negative) of all three Q1s on the chart. News outlets reported that this figure slightly beat analyst expectations and fell between the midpoint and upper range of company-issued guidance. It was also reported that March was particularly strong, citing AI demand momentum.

This supports the claim that the growth rate of NVDA’s DC revenue will stay strong in Q1 and not drop considerably. As stated above, the red growth rate in Q1 would represent $41.0B, or 15.17% growth year over year. This is only slightly lower than the 15.58% YoY growth reported in Q4, and still remarkable growth at the company’s current scale.

A sneaky segment that people may not consider when projecting revenue is NVDA’s Robotics &amp; Auto segment. The graph below illustrates strong growth in this segment, with revenue growing from $0.329B in Q1 to $0.570B in Q4 last year. The segment’s total revenue last year was $1.694B, up 55% from $1.091B the previous year. The graph includes a preliminary estimate for Q1 revenue in this segment ($0.700B) and the YoY growth rate (22.81%).

https://preview.redd.it/xs9n090zf1we1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6d875f3b51d246a454ec04f62baca54be6927bd

[This CNBC article](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2025/02/27/nvidias-auto-segment-revenue-surges-to-record-high-on-demand-for-driver-assist-tech.html) from the end of February does a solid job of explaining why I am particularly bullish on this segment. Large legacy car makers like Mercedes use NVDA automotive, but the segment also has a hat in the ring regarding AI-assisted driving. A particularly noteworthy customer of NVDA AI in auto is Chinese manufacturer BYD, which has been gaining market share in the EV and self-driving spaces in the past two years. BYD posted over $105B of revenue in 2024, more than TSLA’s $97B. Their robust growth continued in Q1 2025, posting 60% growth in sales YoY, while TSLA’s sales declined.

NVDA’s AI for robotics is also growing quickly. With the increased production of humanoid robots by several different technology companies, demand for NVDA robotic AI is also set to increase. The graph above illustrates the strong growth of this segment over the past two years, with another spike in growth in the past two quarters. I expect this growth rate to remain strong, though come down slightly from recent levels. Considering the export restrictions related to China, future growth is hard to predict, however, only a small impact is expected in Q1.

Two consecutive quarters of declining growth in this segment would be unusual compared to historical trends. However, the growth rate remains elevated relative to the prior year. While $0.7B will not help much if Data Center revenue is light, it could add to an already strong headline number if gaming rebounds and DC continues its current pace.

A rebound in gaming revenue is pivotal for NVDA to reach $45B for the quarter. The graph below depicts how poorly NVDA’s gaming segment performed last quarter relative to recent reports. This is not company-specific, as the gaming industry has been on the decline for the past two years. Gaming companies are hopeful that 2025 will see a rebound, and highly anticipated releases are cited as a possible catalyst for the year.

https://preview.redd.it/nfy5dfucg1we1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1bd510768afcfb973a12c246dd690da88c1afc4

While I am not massively bullish on the gaming segment for this quarter, I do expect a return to positive growth. In February, SONY reported quarterly earnings that topped analyst estimates and raised its full-year [guidance.](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/13/sony-earnings-q3-2025.html) The report specifically mentioned increased hardware sales related to gaming. NVDA could see a boost in revenue if its technology inside gaming consoles and PCs has rebounded. Given my cautiousness in this segment, I do not expect the growth rate to return to previous levels immediately. This chart projects a modest $2.75B, less than 6% growth YoY (the segment grew 16% YoY Q1 2024).

MSFT is the biggest player regarding gaming revenue, and reading what the company has to say about the industry in 2025 will provide key insight into this segment. MSFT is expected to report its earnings on April 30th, 2025.

NVDA’s smallest segment in terms of quarterly revenue is Professional Visualization, which is mainly their RTX platform for data visualization. Historically, the growth rate has been a bit more erratic, so using a growth rate similar to recent quarters seems logical. With the size of the segment, it would take significant surprises to meaningfully impact revenue. The graph below shows the recent revenue and growth rate for this segment, as well as my estimate for Q1.

https://preview.redd.it/2ytjiijmg1we1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efb15efb0e8082c4a872b68a5b250b1f9ff0aeb2

So now we have an estimate for the four segments: $41B for Data Center, $2.75B for Gaming, $0.7B for Robotics, and $0.55B for Professional Visualization. The sum of these totals is $45B, which is about 5% higher than NVDA’s company-issued guidance and about 4% higher than the current analyst consensus.

 **First Revenue Estimate: $45.0B**

While it is simple to understand that the $5.5B charge will negatively affect profitability, it is much more difficult to consider all possible externalities, and the GAAP vs Non-GAAP distinction adds another layer of sophistication. As mentioned above, the charge will likely be listed as a GAAP Non-Operating Expense. This means that both Non-GAAP expense segments should be minimally impacted, and depending on the gross margin of H20 chips, that figure for Q1 could improve modestly. The most significantly impacted metric in Non-GAAP reporting is total revenue, as lost sales will generate less profit for the business. Q1 revenue will only see a small impact, as the news broke with minimal time left in the quarter. Guidance will almost certainly reference these restrictions as headwinds when forecasting for the year**.**

[My last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1inbfdz/nvda_q4_fy_2025_earnings_revenue_and_guidance/) went into deep detail on what EPS is exactly and how it is calculated. The highlights for NVDA include taking the total revenue and multiplying it by the gross margin. Then, take that product and subtract operating expenses. The result is Operating Income. Net Income can now be found by taking out Non-Operating Expenses. Finally, the Net Income is divided by the total number of shares, and the output is an Earnings Per Share (EPS) calculation. Since the previous section established the revenue estimate, the remaining information needed for an EPS estimate is the following: Gross Margin, Operating Expenses, Non-Operating Expenses, and Shares Outstanding.

Last quarter’s estimate used the company-issued guidance from the preceding quarter and was exactly the number reported in Q4 (73.5%). NVDA issued guidance of 71% for Q1 before any restrictions or trade concerns. Considering that H20 chips were reported to be a “lower-margin product,” according to BofA analyst Vivek Arya, a smaller percentage of sales of H20 and more sales from high-margin items could potentially raise gross margins for Q1. Since previously issued guidance has been accurate, and the impact of H20 is minimal and possibly favorable, company guidance will be used once again.

NVDA guided for approximately $3.6B in Non-GAAP operating expenses for the current quarter, up from $3.38B last quarter. This is another case in which NVDA’s guidance proved accurate, as the guidance given in Q3 for the previous quarter was $3.4B. The Company is guiding a 5.89% QoQ or 44% YoY increase in operating expenses in Q1.

Non-operating expenses is the segment where the $5.5B charge will hit, but only in the GAAP tables. This amount is significant as it is higher than NVDA’s total guided GAAP Operating Expenses for the quarter. Adding this charge will significantly reduce GAAP Net Income and therefore GAAP EPS. However, this will not be a part of the Non-GAAP expenses calculation and will minimally affect Non-GAAP EPS. The headline print usually focuses on Non-GAAP metrics.

NVDA does not guide Non-Operating Expenses, so 8-K filings and the investor relations pages are sometimes the best data available. Last quarter, NVDA reported \~$3.5B in this segment, which is an increase of 5.63% QoQ and 80.63% YoY. In Q1 of last year, Non-Operating Expenses were $2.82B. An increase of 80% YoY would mean NVDA reports $3.8B in Non-Operating Expenses for the current quarter.

The final remaining item to consider is the number of shares outstanding. The Q4 post referenced the status and details of NVDA’s share repurchase plan and estimated the number of shares repurchased in Q4. NVDA bought fewer shares in Q4 than the post estimated, and bought back $7.81B in Q4. The Company had \~$39B remaining authorized for share repurchases without expiration at the time of NVDA’s Q4 Earnings. Given the downswing in the stock, partially offset by uncertainty in the macro, this post estimates \~$9B in repurchases in Q1. This would reduce the number of shares outstanding to about 24.62B shares.

All the inputs have been gathered, and the equation to find EPS looks like this:

X = \[ (R\*G) - (O+N) \] / S

Where X is EPS,  
R is Revenue ($45B),  
G is Gross Margin (71%),  
O is Operating Expense ($3.6B),  
N is Non-Operating Expense ($3.8B),  
S is Shares Outstanding (24.62B)

X = \[ (45.0\*.71) - (3.6+3.8) \] / 24.62 = $0.9972

Rounding to the nearest cent, we get $1.00 EPS on $45.0B of quarterly revenue. The only item left to consider is forward guidance. At this time, the macroenvironment is changing daily, and forecasting for multiple months out seems currently impossible. NVDA will have some early Q2 data to use in their analysis; however, at this time, forward guidance will be omitted.

I plan to update this analysis, including estimating guidance, in the future. These updates and future full reports will be housed on patreon (not linking for self-promo rules), while overall estimates and general analysis will remain coming to Reddit/YT/X/etc. Please consider finding me there if these write ups prove valuable to you.

TL;DR:   
EPS: $1.00 vs $0.92est  
Revenue: $45.00B vs $43.1B   
Guidance: Currently omitted due to rapidly changing macro  
Price Target: $135 (30x FY26 Earnings of \~$4.5/share)

When the news first hit, Nvidia stock sold off, investors hate uncertainty, and geopolitical risk tends to rattle sentiment even more than earnings misses. But for long-term investors, this kind of valuation reset might be more of a buying opportunity than a red flag. I've also been using a few AI-powered investment assistants for advice lately. They are definitely getting smarter than before, not perfect, but incorporating more real-time and accurate data could offer quite actionable insights, at least as a reference. Plus, the rapid progress of AI models is also a positive signal for NVDA itself.

I think Nvidia is downplaying the extent of how big a hit this will be to their stock. Essentially half of Nvidia’s sales are to Asia and the Trump admin is looking into how to stop the smuggling too.

I think knowing how others are doing will help us all feel a little less alone and probably more calm in this uncertain times in the stock market. Please feel free to add as much information as you would like, including % down (or $ amounts), your age, composition of your portfolio (i.e. what industries), largest holdings, any tactical shifts you’re hoping to make/any changes you have made in your portfolio etc as a way to approach the volatility in the markets.

For me, my portfolio is down 25% from all time highs hit in February. 80% of my stocks are in tech, 25% of my portfolio is NVDA. I have been making some tactical shifts, selling some big tech stocks holdings in favor of non-tech names, although I ended up buying UNH (United Healthcare) thinking it’s would be recession-resistant play, and of course the stock dropped 25% yesterday.",116,Playful-Inspector207,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k2i1uj/how_much_is_your_portfolio_down_by/,1k2i1uj

- Can NVDA open a factory in another country, like China as a private company or is it fully under government control?
- How is it fair that a company like Tesla can open factories in China?
- As a shareholder, if the US government can unilaterally ban sales for ""security"" reasons, shouldn't the government also be obliged to compensate the company for expected losses? (5.5 billion in this instance).

“Our software content per vehicle can be in the thousands of dollars over the lifetime of the vehicle compared to the hundreds of dollars for the hardware. And second, software scales with the installed base of vehicles, not annual production,” she added.
Nvidia’s automotive business has three components: the Drive software stack for autonomous driving; in-vehicle hardware; and the datacenter infrastructure for management, training, and simulation, which were all upgraded at GTC.
Preeminent automotive chip players, such as Renesas and NXP, are largely focused on supplying the components. Nvidia’s full-stack approach takes some stress away from vehicle makers by providing the necessary tools and resources to train, test, and deploy complex AI systems.

I'm of course aware that the WH is currently an attention seeking drama queen. And that the dot com bubble bursted even though the internet is insanely useful.

About five weeks ago, I opened a $25K position in NVDL (500 shares at 50.3$) when NVDA was sitting around $125. I’ve always been a pretty cautious investor, but after watching some colleagues pull in strong gains over the past year,I decided to dip my toes in.

This position is about 10% of my overall portfolio, but I’m currently down around 40%. I’m reaching out to get a sense of what others think. I can handle the loss if there’s still a reasonable shot at breaking even or turning a profit, but what’s really been tough is the decay. At this point, NVDA would need to hit around $135 just for me to break even.

Do you think it makes more sense to cut my losses now and switch into NVDA directly, or just ride it out with NVDL?

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

[**HTZ (Hertz)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HTZ&amp;p=d)\- Pershing Square Capital Management, led by Bill Ackman, disclosed a stake of 12.7 million shares in HTZ. This caused a surge to $9 yesterday, and I'm interested in how it does at the open, but ultimately biased short. Not interested in taking a short position unless we break $9/10. Interesting thought experiment : Is their fleet of cars is worth far more (after the effects of tariffs) than what the company is actually valued at? 

[**LLY (Eli Lilly)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LLY&amp;p=d)\- LLY's experimental oral drug, orforglipron, achieved up to 7.9% weight loss and blood sugar reduction in a late-stage trial involving type 2 diabetes patients, exceeding expectations. Overall, it's too high priced to day trade, but will likely size down to trade it if it continues to rise. As an oral GLP-1, this is far preferable as a delivery method for weight loss drugs, although there is significant competition in this space.

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d) / [**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&amp;p=d)\- Both companies are facing major headwinds from newly imposed U.S. export restrictions on AI chips to China. NVDA expects a $5.5B charge tied to its H20 chips, while AMD anticipates an $800M impact from its MI308 chips. These policy moves mainly due to the US's attempts to maintain the AI lead but affect semis companies negatively. The restrictions create uncertainty in hardware markets. Risks include prolonged geopolitical conflict, regulatory overhang, and market share loss in China.

[**UNH (UnitedHealth Group)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&amp;p=d)\- Reported Q1 earnings miss with EPS of $7.20 and revenue of $109.6B, and also lowered full-year guidance. The stock is down nearly 20% pre-market, with interest in trying to play some kind of bounce if it drops to $450; otherwise, there isn't much interest due to the high price and illiquidity. I could go on some spiel of how most of these insurance companies exist to just extract money from the government but this is a trading watchlist, not a political sounding board lol. We might also see CI move in sympathy more after the open, mainly due to these companies all having similar margins.

After years of bouncing between trends, missing some massive moves (energy in 2022, early AI), and learning from crashes like 2020 and 2022, I’ve built what I hope is a **macro-resilient, globally balanced, thematic long-term portfolio**.

It’s designed to:

* Withstand **2020-style collapses**
* Endure **2022 inflation + rate shocks**
* Thrive in **AI, robotics, green energy, space, and aging population megacycles**
* Hold through decades — **not just years**

Would love your takes, critiques, and improvements.

# What I’m Trying to Solve

I wanted something that:

* Doesn’t rely on me watching CNBC every day
* Doesn’t panic-sell when things get ugly
* Still captures long-term megatrends
* Feels like a **real system**, not a Reddit FOMO portfolio

# Looking for Feedback On:

* Am I *too* diversified?
* Should I consolidate some ETFs or lean harder into fewer themes?
* Am I missing any critical macro theme? (nuclear? private credit? Agri?)
* Would you trust this structure to grow for 30+ years with minimal maintenance?

Looking forward to your feedback on this.

That thesis simply doesn’t hold up to scrutiny — especially in light of OpenAI’s latest announcement today.

Take a look at the AIME performance chart from OpenAI’s new frontier model (o3). It shows a **direct, consistent correlation between compute usage and model performance**. More compute = better models. Full stop. No tricks, no shortcuts.

[https://imgur.com/a/MU2z77b](https://imgur.com/a/MU2z77b)

Yes, we’re seeing architectural improvements that increase training efficiency. But these gains don’t shrink the pie — **they expand it**. Every efficiency gain is reinvested into building even larger and more capable models. This is the scaling law trend, and Nvidia is at the center of it.

Now to DeepSeek: impressive optimization work, but let’s be real — their model is just riding on top of the massive foundation Nvidia enabled. DeepSeek’s “efficiency” is only relevant because **they still needed access to high-end GPUs to train it in the first place**. No one is training SOTA on CPUs or low-cost commodity hardware. Every frontier model — whether from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or DeepSeek — relies on Nvidia’s stack to get off the ground.

Here’s the bullish reality:

* Model performance still scales with compute — OpenAI just showed us that again.
* Efficient models don’t kill GPU demand; they unlock **even more ambitious models** and **more widespread deployments**.
* Inference is exploding. Every assistant, every copilots, every agent… all of them need sustained GPU access.
* Nvidia has built a full-stack moat: CUDA, TensorRT, networking, and ecosystem lock-in.

The smarter argument isn’t that Nvidia demand will fall — it’s that demand will **explode in more directions**: training, inference, on-device, edge. Efficient models don’t reduce Nvidia’s relevance.

[Gold](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/investing/article/gold-price-today-wednesday-april-16-2025-gold-opens-with-new-high-134956304.html) has surpassed the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks as the most crowded trade on Wall Street as the precious metal surged to record highs this year amid volatile markets and an uncertain economic backdrop.

According to the latest Bank of America fund managers survey published this week, nearly half of the fund managers surveyed (49%) see long gold, or bets that gold prices will rise, as the most crowded trade in the market right now. This marks the first time in two years that fund managers did not see the Magnificent Seven as Wall Street's most crowded trade, according to the survey.

Gold futures ([GC=F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GC=F/)) on Wednesday rose to an all-time high of $3,334 as investors continued to [favor the safe-haven asset](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-notches-best-week-since-2020-amid-shaken-investor-confidence-in-us-201546983.html) amid a falling US dollar ([DX-Y.NYB](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!HIhgXKgPRojUSTTqYlaKSTMqCnabU-_BFJYcQNg1l9bJcllZ1Gp3LtN-1O0pcbknpYvKz0DBczt7-zHHf99GDzXJ1VfxDc7wuw$)) and tariff uncertainty.

Gold prices have surged more than 27% year to date, while the Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL), [GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)), and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) — are down considerably.

Tesla stock has led Magnificent Seven losses and is down about 38% since the start of 2025. Apple stock has fallen 21%.

Nvidia stock has also declined 21% year to date. On Wednesday,[ the AI chip giant warned of a multibillion-dollar ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-dives-as-chipmaker-sees-55-billion-hit-from-surprise-china-chip-controls-130319576.html)impact from US export controls on China, which weighed on shares.

Shares of Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon — the remainder of the Magnificent Seven — are all down by double-digit percentages since the start of the year.

Gold's rally comes as [central banks' demand hit all-time highs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-demand-hits-record-levels-as-central-banks-buy-at-eye-watering-pace-205945413.html) last year and as investors increased inflows into physical gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

""The new highs in gold are signaling a shift in appetite for US assets,"" Ryan McIntyre, senior managing partner at asset manager firm Sprott, recently told Yahoo Finance.

""Confidence in the US has clearly been shaken, so people are looking to diversify.""

Wall Street analysts have remained bullish on gold, [upping their price forecasts ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-keeps-upping-its-bullish-calls-on-gold--heres-why-162732492.html)on the precious metal even amid its fast ascent.

Some 42% of fund managers expect gold will be the best-performing asset of 2025, up from 23% in March, according to Bank of America.

2025-04-16 15:17:15,r/NVDA_Stock,Nvidia’s $5.5B Write-Down Isn’t a Death Knell — It’s an Export Licensing Delay (Official SEC Filing),"After Nvidia dropped nearly 6% post-market, headlines started flying about a $5.5 billion “loss” related to China. But here’s what the official Form 8-K filed with the SEC says—and why this might be a market overreaction based on misunderstanding.

⸻

1. What Actually Happened?

On April 9, 2025, the U.S. government informed Nvidia that exports of its H20 chips (and any chip matching its bandwidth capabilities) to China, Hong Kong, Macau, and D:5 countries now require a license. On April 14, Nvidia was told the licensing requirement would remain in effect “for the indefinite future.”

“The USG indicated that the license requirement addresses the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China.”


⸻

2. The $5.5B Isn’t Cash Burn—It’s a Write-Down

Nvidia announced that their Q1 FY2026 earnings (ending April 27) will include “up to approximately $5.5 billion of charges associated with H20 products”—covering inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves.

This is an accounting adjustment, not a hemorrhage of cash. If licenses are granted or chips are reallocated, parts of this may be recoverable.

“Charges associated with H20 products for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves.”


⸻

3. No Total Ban = No Total Collapse

This isn’t an embargo. It’s a regulatory bottleneck. The chips can’t be exported until licenses are granted. The real unknown is how long the delay lasts—or if China will get permanently locked out. But Nvidia hasn’t been banned from selling globally.

⸻

4. Why the 6% Drop May Be Overkill

Wall Street shaved ~$140B off Nvidia’s market cap on a forward-looking risk, not an operational miss. The charge is front-loaded. It doesn’t mean $5.5B vanishes every quarter.

This kind of drop only makes sense if you believe:
	•	Nvidia never gets licenses again
	•	China sales are permanently dead
	•	The H20 inventory is entirely unsellable

None of that is confirmed.

⸻

5. Where It Goes From Here

Watch for:
	•	Any updates on U.S. Commerce Department export licenses
	•	Nvidia’s pivot: will they re-bin, re-market, or repurpose H20s?
	•	China’s own AI trajectory: will it accelerate local GPU production (Huawei, etc.)?

⸻

TL;DR

Nvidia didn’t lose $5.5B in cash. The U.S. imposed a licensing requirement on certain chips, forcing Nvidia to adjust the value of inventory on hand. The chips aren’t bricked—they’re just paused. The 6% drop might be a market overreaction, not a sign of long-term structural damage.

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [China Tells Airlines Stop Taking Boeing Jets As Trump Tariffs Expand Trade War](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-15/china-tells-airlines-stop-taking-boeing-jets-as-trump-tariffs-expand-trade-war)

[**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)\- Nvidia announced it expects a $5.5B charge in Q1 2026 due to new U.S. export restrictions on its H20 AI chips to China. These chips were lobotomized versions initially designed to comply with earlier export controls but are now subject to stricter licensing requirements under the Trump administration's policies. I'm mainly interested if NVDA breaks $100 to the downside. The semis industry is volatile due to escalating U.S.-China trade tensions, affecting AMD and INTC (not as much) as well. Export policy volatility regarding semis exports will likely be in flux rather than having some kind of set policy and affect global AI chip demand. He who controls the spice controls the universe!!!!

[**IBKR (Interactive Brokers)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=IBKR&amp;p=d)\- Reported Q1 adjusted EPS of $1.88 vs $1.92 expected. Revenue of $1.43B vs $1.42B expected. Despite the earnings miss, they announced a 28% dividend increase and a 4-for-1 stock split effective mid-July. Most of these brokerages have been selling off from the market peak around mid Feb, but I don't consider these to be interesting at the moment for outperformance, unless they fall further. Risks to watch out for in these include decreasing retail trading activity, fee compression, and competition from zero-commission platforms. (Also worth noting HOOD also fell from the Feb market peak)

[**META (Meta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&amp;p=d)\- Zuck testified in an FTC antitrust trial about Meta's acquisition of Instagram, with internal emails suggesting shady motives. The FTC alleges the moves were to neutralize competition and monopolize the social media space. We've had a significant selloff for the past 2 months from 750 to 500, and while not extremely liquid due to price/volume, it's still worth pursuing if there is some catalyst for a forced sale of Instagram (unlikely). Risks include potential breakup rulings (this is the white whale trade), broader regulatory clampdowns, and increased oversight of tech M&amp;A (we've seen less M&amp;A already this year in the Trump admin mainly due to volatility).

[**ASML (Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography)-**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASML&amp;p=d)  Reported Q1 net sales of €7.74B vs €7.8B expected, and net profit of €2.36B vs €2.3B expected. **Net bookings came in at €3.94B vs €4.89B expected, well below forecasts.** CEO flagged tariff-related uncertainty as a key risk to forward demand. Order shortfall is a bad sign (and also an explanation for why the rest of the semis fell as well). I typically don't trade super high priced stocks like this due to the spread but ultimately interested if we fall further to last week's levels (\~$600).",20,WinningWatchlist,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k0k38d/0416_interesting_stocks_today_he_who_controls_the/,1k0k38d
2025-04-16 12:57:26,r/NVDA_Stock,Why I believe selling NVIDIA just because the company announced a $5.5 billion quarterly charge related to H20 GPU exports to China and other destinations doesn’t make sense. Here’s my investment thesis.,"Selling NVIDIA stock just because the company announced a one-time quarterly charge of $5.5 billion related to the export of its H20 GPUs to China and other destinations doesn’t make sense.

The H20 chip line accounts for less than 10% of NVIDIA’s total revenue — roughly between $12 and $15 billion out of a total of $131 billion. Even if NVIDIA sees a 50% drop in H20 chip sales — which roughly corresponds to the total sales from China, Taiwan, and Singapore - it would still generate between $5 and $7 billion in H20 revenue from other markets, such as the U.S.

That would leave NVIDIA with well over $123 billion in total revenue, even after the impact of export restrictions.

Moreover, NVIDIA has projected continued revenue growth over the next two years, largely driven by sustained demand for AI and data center solutions. So freaking out over a one-time hit from regulations misses the bigger picture: NVIDIA is still a major player in a market that's growing fast.",85,AlexandreSh1941,https://i.redd.it/d4wnprfbh6ve1.png,1k0hjwt

# Key Takeaways

* Netflix shares jumped Tuesday after a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.
* The streaming giant aims to double its revenue by 2030 and reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday.
* Netflix is set to report first-quarter results after the market closes Thursday.

Netflix (NLFX) shares jumped Tuesday following a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.

Executives said the streaming giant aims to double the $39 billion in revenue Netflix brought in last year, with a global ad sales target of $9 billion by 2030, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The streaming giant also aims to reach a [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) of $1 trillion by 2030, the report said, up from roughly $419.2 billion. The only U.S. companies with a market cap above $1 trillion today include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B).

Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shares were up more than 5% in recent trading Tuesday, leading gains on the S&amp;P 500. They've added about 60% of their value over the past 12 months. (Read *Investopedia's* live coverage of [today's market action here](https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-04152025-11715325).)

Last week, Morgan Stanley analysts named Netflix a [“top pick,”](https://www.investopedia.com/netflix-a-top-pick-for-morgan-stanley-on-expected-resilience-to-a-weaker-market-11712037) arguing the company could be well-positioned to withstand the current tariff landscape. The streaming giant has shown ""momentum” in its core subscription business, the analysts said. That momentum lowers the company’s overall risk, the bank added, even if the advertising market struggles amid rising trade tensions.

[**MP (MP Materials)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MP&amp;p=d)\- Trump is preparing an executive order to establish a U.S. strategic reserve of critical rare earth minerals and metals, aiming to reduce U.S. dependence on China, which has recently halted exports of seven rare earth elements to the U.S. in response to trade tensions. Interested in MP's $30 level. Rare earth metals are important because they're used in technology, electronics, defense, and literally everything with a computer, with China controlling over 80% of all REMs. It is noteworthy that China entirely refines these metals and produces 90% of the global supply of these magnets. We're back in BLOPS2 baby! 

[**BA (Boeing)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BA&amp;p=d)\-China has ordered its airlines to suspend deliveries of Boeing jets and halt purchases of aircraft-related equipment and parts from U.S. companies, a direct response to the U.S. imposing tariffs as high as 145% on Chinese goods. Interested in the $150 level. China is a significant market for BA, accounting for a substantial portion (20%!) of its projected deliveries over the next two decades. Despite being far smaller in comparison to Airbus, BA's planes are reserved years in advance, making it difficult for China to avoid using U.S. planes.

[**BULL (Webull Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BULL&amp;p=d)\-Webull Corporation completed a reverse merger with SK Growth Opportunities Corporation and is finally listed after delaying their IPO for years. Overall not interested in this unless we break yesterday's highs, as the price 8x'ing seems ludicrous for a company that should be priced relatively easily (because we have comparables such as HOOD/other brokerages). I'm biased negatively on this stock today.

[**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)\-Nvidia has announced plans to invest up to $500B in building AI supercomputers entirely in the United States. This initiative includes establishing over a million square feet of manufacturing space in Texas, partnering with companies like Foxconn and Wistron. This seems like a play to avoid getting semis tariffed, although the outcome is uncertain, especially with Trump announcing upcoming tariffs in a month or two. Overall see a lot more uncertainty in this stock and AAPL, so extremely important to be aware of the tariff narrative.

2025-04-11 21:59:43,r/NVDA_Stock,Apple screwed up big time by not buying enough Nvidia DC gpus,"An article in today's New York Times details how Apple's AI development has been hurt by failing to buy enough AI gpus back in 2023.  

Quick summary - In early 2023, Apple had 50K old gpus (V100s?) at the time.  Tim Cook approved a plan to double AI chip spending, but the CFO cut that number in half, leaving the AI team without enough resources to do their work.

Nvidia chips aren't specifically mentioned, but no other company was selling DC gpus in volume at that time, so Nvidia was the only option.

Moral of the story - You are taking an existential risk by not using Nvidia AI systems!

===================

From the article:

""The A.I. stumble was set in motion in early 2023. Mr. Giannandrea, who was overseeing the effort, sought approval from the company’s chief executive, Tim Cook, to buy more A.I. chips, known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, five people with knowledge of the request said. The chips, which can perform hundreds of computations at the same time, are critical to building the neural networks of A.I. systems, like chatbots, that can answer questions or write software code.

At the time, Apple’s data centers had about 50,000 GPUs that were more than five years old — far fewer than the hundreds of thousands of chips being bought at the time by A.I. leaders like Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta, these people said.

Mr. Cook approved a plan to double the team’s chip budget, but Apple’s finance chief, Luca Maestri, reduced the increase to less than half that, the people said. Mr. Maestri encouraged the team to make the chips they had more efficient.

The lack of GPUs meant the team developing A.I. systems had to negotiate for data center computing power from its providers like Google and Amazon, two of the people said. The leading chips made by Nvidia were in such demand that Apple used alternative chips made by Google for some of its A.I. development.""

“Tariffs will be negotiated away. Buy as much stocks as possible!

Everyone here is panicking and thinking these tariffs are going to destroy everything. It’s not an incorrect thought… IF they stay in effect for a long period. 

However it’s important to listen to what Trump has said. Trump said he’s open to tarrif cuts if countries offer something phenomenal. He also said now these countries will be coming to us to negotiate rather than the other way around. He used tik tok as an example to say he may cut tarrif on china to close a tik tok deal. 

Trump put these tariffs in effect to give him huge leverage over every country. He even bragged that every country has called him to negotiate. Acting tough like the tariffs will be in place for a few years, is ONLY to increase their leverage. The more difficult it seems to remove tariffs the more negotiating power Trump has. 

This is a rare stock crash where it’s completely self inflicted with the signing of a pen from the president. This means to end this pain will ONLY take the president to end the tariffs- which can be done instantly. 

I am very sure this will be exactly like the Covid crash. He will keep talking a big talk and more and more terrible news will come out. But then there will be cracks as exceptions are made and deals are negotiated. This is literally the man who wrote “Art of the Deal”. He is 100% transactional and is always aiming to make a deal.

Personally I am buying AI stocks like crazy. This is probably the last chance to get on the AI boat before this stuff rockets. SMH, ASML, NVDA, AMZN META—- all these big tech names will come out fine long term. No matter how scary it gets just keep buying. “",0,Jshbone12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jvgeuy/i_warned_everyone_tariffs_were_a_negotiating/,1jvgeuy

2025-04-09 19:30:34,r/NVDA_Stock,Here's why daily news regarding tariffs shouldn't bother you,"N.B.: If you are worried about NVIDIA's price because you need liquidity, are over-leveraged, or need to get out of your position sometime soon for any reason, this obviously doesn't apply.

How is a stock valued, and why do we buy stocks? The value of a company is the discounted value of its future cash flows, and nothing more. We buy stocks for the sole reason that a company will generate sufficient cash flows in the future in order to satisfy our required rate of return.

What moves stock prices?

(1) As we get closer to future earnings being realised (i.e., as time passes), we discount those earnings less and less. We get a little bit closer to those future earnings. Consequently, the stock price increases as the discount rate falls.

(2) Things which change our expectations of future earnings. For example, were news to arise that AAPL had been faking its numbers and was actually on the brink of bankruptcy, its stock price would quickly fall to near zero, since there are little to no future earnings to expect.

(3) Short-term events, including human behaviour (e.g. Gamestop) or macro events (interest rates, inflation, tariffs, government policy, etc). Short-term events based on human behaviour should be disregarded. Short-term macro events obviously matter in the short-term and should be taken into account when modelling any future earnings of a company. These macro events are very similar to (2) in that they change our expectations of future earnings, but usually only for the next few years. Governments change, and so do macro conditions.

Example: DeepSeek.

The price of NVDA fell pretty sharply when news about DeepSeek came out, since people were worried that people would spend a lot less on its chips. As people calmed down and began to realise that lower prices could mean a broader take-up, and the same or even more earnings as a result, the stock price began to rise up to its previous levels (recovering to c. $140, vs. $147 before).

What about tariffs?

Tariffs fall under category (3). Let's assume worst-case scenario: let's assume that they are a horrible policy and last for the entirety of the Trump presidency, before being removed by whomever the next president happens to be. Let's also assume that they cut earnings sharply over the next 4 years.

That would mean that ... earnings would recover after 4 years, and the NPV of future earnings would be damaged, but not enough to be posting about selling all the time.

The point I am trying to make is: macro conditions change like the wind, and should not distract us from our determination of the fundamental value of NVDA. If it is a good company that generates solid cash flow and will continue to do so at reasonable growth rates, then its stock price will increase in the long-run. Let's not let emotions rule us.",23,lmarketing2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1jvbjyv/heres_why_daily_news_regarding_tariffs_shouldnt/,1jvbjyv

TL;DR there is a 2.08% estimated increase in COGS which is minimal and would only have to raise prices by ~$600 per B200 to maintain the same gross profit per unit.

——————————————————————-

To determine Nvidia’s net tariff rate under the new U.S. tariffs, we need to consider that 60% of their DGX servers are manufactured in Mexico with a tariff exemption for semiconductors, break this down by business segment, calculate the total effect on cost, and express it as a percentage of revenue. Let’s analyze this step-by-step.

Assumptions and Data

	•	DGX Servers: These are AI datacenter servers within Nvidia’s Data Center segment. We’re told 60% are made in Mexico, and semiconductors are exempt from tariffs. Additional data suggests 30% are from Taiwan (subject to a 32% tariff) and 10% from other countries (assumed at a 10% baseline tariff unless specified otherwise).

	•	Tariff Rules: Semiconductors are exempt, but server hardware is not, except under specific exemptions (e.g., USMCA for Mexico). Nvidia’s DGX servers from Mexico fall under HTS codes (8471.50 and 8471.80) exempt from U.S.-Mexico tariffs under USMCA.

	•	Business Segments: Nvidia’s revenue comes from Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, Automotive, and others. Data Center, driven by AI servers like DGX, is the largest segment. For 2025, we assume Data Center is 80% of total revenue (based on trends, e.g., 78% in fiscal 2024), with Gaming at 15% and others at 5%.

	•	Gross Margin: Nvidia’s company-wide gross margin is approximately 75.5%, meaning cost of goods sold (COGS) is 24.5% of revenue. We assume this applies roughly to the Data Center segment for simplicity.

Step 1: Data Center Segment Analysis

The Data Center segment includes DGX servers, which are complete server systems (not just semiconductors). Tariffs apply to the import value of these servers, depending on their origin.

	•	Import Breakdown:
	◦	60% from Mexico: Exempt (0% tariff) due to USMCA and specific HTS code exemptions.
	◦	30% from Taiwan: 32% tariff applies, as server hardware lacks a general exemption.
	◦	10% from other countries: 10% baseline tariff (assuming no specific reciprocal rate applies).
	•	Effective Tariff Rate on Imports: Calculate the weighted average tariff rate on the import value of DGX servers: [ (0.6 \times 0%) + (0.3 \times 32%) + (0.1 \times 10%) = 0% + 9.6% + 1% = 10.6% ] So, Nvidia pays tariffs equal to 10.6% of the total import value of DGX servers.

	•	Import Value Relative to Revenue: Assume the import value of DGX servers approximates the COGS for these products. With a 75.5% gross margin, COGS is 24.5% of Data Center revenue (R_data). Thus, import value ( V \approx 0.245 \times R_{data} ).

	•	Tariff Cost: Tariffs = 10.6% of import value: [ \text{Tariffs} = 0.106 \times V = 0.106 \times 0.245 \times R_{data} \approx 0.02597 \times R_{data} \approx 2.6% \text{ of } R_{data} ] The tariff increases Data Center COGS by approximately 2.6% of segment revenue.

Step 2: Other Segments Analysis

	•	Gaming: Primarily GPUs, classified as semiconductors (e.g., HTS code 8542.31 for advanced GPUs), which are exempt. Tariff rate = 0%.

	•	Professional Visualization, Automotive, Others: These also rely on GPUs or similar components, assumed exempt as semiconductors. Tariff rate = 0%.
Since tariffs primarily affect the Data Center segment’s server imports, other segments have negligible tariff costs under these assumptions.

Step 3: Total Effect on Nvidia’s Costs

	•	Revenue Share: Assume Data Center is 80% of total revenue (R_total), so ( R_{data} = 0.8 \times R_{total} ).

	•	Total Tariff Cost: [ \text{Total Tariffs} = 0.02597 \times R_{data} = 0.02597 \times 0.8 \times R_{total} \approx 0.020776 \times R_{total} \approx 2.08% \text{ of } R_{total} ] Tariffs add approximately 2.08% of total revenue to Nvidia’s COGS.

	•	Impact on Gross Margin: Original COGS = 24.5% of R_total. New COGS = 24.5% + 2.08% = 26.58%. Gross margin drops from 75.5% to 73.42%, a reduction of 2.08 percentage points.

Step 4: Net Tariff Rate Interpretation

The “net tariff rate” could mean the effective tariff on imports (10.6% for Data Center servers) or the cost impact as a percentage of revenue. Since the query requests the “total effect on cost” translated to “a percentage of revenue,” we interpret it as the latter: 2.08%.

Final Answer

	•	By Segment:
	◦	Data Center: Tariff increases costs by ~2.6% of segment revenue.

	◦	Gaming and Others: ~0% tariff impact.

	•	Total Effect: Tariffs increase Nvidia’s costs by approximately 2.08% of total revenue.

Thus, Nvidia’s net tariff rate, expressed as the cost impact relative to total revenue, is approximately 2.08%.

2025-04-08 21:06:17,r/NVDA_Stock,PSA to everyone wondering what’s going on,"First of all I’m sick of all the short term traders (probably coming from the crypto scene) who are screaming in the subreddit recently to buy or sell.

- NVIDIA is fine. Fundamentally it’s still the forefront of AI and at the top of its competition. They are beating earnings and there’s no sign of a shortage for their chips.

- However, everyone here needs to realise that in the current landscape, fundamentals or chart analysis are not only out of the window - they’ve been murdered and hung up in the streets.

- Right now a single news article holds the power of moving the stock +-20% depending on if it’s good or bad for the market. NVIDIA is heavily connected with SPY and QQQ because it’s one of the largest percentages. Act accordingly.

- We are still in a bull market for now but we are suppressed and forced bearish by the trump admin. Market wants to go up but tariffs say no. 

My advice: if you have spare funds, get your cost basis down by buying dips. If you are fully cash, invest daily and double down on dip days. The market will eventually correct itself when this is resolved. Don’t FOMO because everything is volatile right now it might be up +10% and down -10% the next day.

Zoom out on the chart and decide whether a purchase or sale is worth it. Every other stock right now has the same issue. NVIDIA seems to be one of the most volatile stocks due to its connection with the biggest ETFs. If you need to readjust your portfolio due to the volatility please do so.

Finally: stop pushing people to buy and sell. Some people here are way to invested in other people’s investments.",157,Agreeable_Ad1271,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1julprk/psa_to_everyone_wondering_whats_going_on/,1julprk

&gt; US stocks lost steam in afternoon trading on Tuesday after the White House confirmed the US is moving forward with 104% tariffs on China beginning at 12:01 AM ET.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Americans do not need other countries as much as other countries need us,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters during a briefing. ""President Trump has a spine of steel and he will not break.""
&gt; 
&gt; The benchmark S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) were up 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, with Nvidia (NVDA) rising just over 2% by the afternoon after a 7% gain earlier in the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) popped roughly 0.7%, adding around 250 points. Earlier in the session, the index had added over 1,300 points.
&gt; 
&gt; Buyers are wading back into the market after Trump's fast-moving tariff push spurred a roller-coaster session on Monday, which saw the Dow sink 350 points and the S&amp;P 500 cement a historic three-day loss.
&gt; 
&gt; Spirits got an initial boost after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hailed the start of bilateral trade talks with Japan. The news alleviated fears that the White House wasn't prepared to cut deals on tariffs, given trade adviser Peter Navarro's comment to the Financial Times that Trump's tariffs were ""not a negotiation.""",1,Fidler_2K,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jujayy/white_house_press_secretary_says_americans_do_not/,1jujayy

2025-04-08 10:13:42,r/NVDA_Stock,Why I'm not buying this moment,"I've held Nvidia since mid aughts and made a ton.   I've diversified maybe 50% original holdings over the last nearly 20 years, but still hold a ridiculous amount of stock.

When ever I think about hold vs sell over the long term, my attention focuses on two things:  1.  outlook 2.  competition.   Both 1 and 2 are solid in Nvidia's favor, my confidence in the future remains high.  This company has another decade of growth ahead, at least.

When the stock starting giving weaker indicators earlier this year that it was going fall below support (\~$117), I sold a portion of my holdings, [13K shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1j3vgpl/comment/mgczkgb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button).  That cash is now idle and waiting for the right moment to be redeployed.  And it will be, seven figures plowed back in, but at a deep discount.

Nvidia is the market now, the top tech stocks all basically shape the S&amp;P, just look compare the daily charts.  A buddy send me a note on an analyst newsletter the other day that resonated with my experience in this stock.  20 years of being a pupil in the stock, this is, I believe, an accurate description of the signal Nvidia (generally) displays after a big drop like this: 

""our attention will be directed toward identifying an attractive stock market buying opportunity. **That process involves establishing an initial area of price stability, followed by a short-term rally, and then a successful test of the bottom area with improving internal technical indicators.**""

  
He was talking about the market, the S&amp;P.  But as I say the S&amp;P is now one with NVDA, they move the same.

We honestly don't know if $86 is going to hold.   All you guys buying today?   I think you're hoping for the bottom, I hope you're right.  But many of you have been too eager with the buy-the-dip mantra (and we all know hope ain't a strategy).   

Above is the strategy I'm waiting for, a retest of $86.   Hang in there, patience is the one power you have over wall st. if you can exercise it.  The market is handing us all a gift:  Reward will come to those who are patient, but the bell at the bottom hasn't rung yet.

I understand people are scared. It makes sense. People just got their 401k's possibly wiped out. The people who managed their own portfolio got on the rocketship that is Nvidia under the premise that it was going to keep going up. This isn't reality. All things that go up must come down. 

These tarrifs are intense and affecting nearly all sectors in some capacity. Prices for good and services are on the rise. Stocks are on the down turn. Whatever are we to do? I argue that this is when and where you invest. Invest is the keyword. 

Many people are looking for quick gains, to day trade, run options, etc. This is not the way. Buy, hold, check, and forget. Everyone and anyone can look and feel like a market genius when the market is up. It's when the market is falling that the attentive win. Stash and cash. 

I'm not here to give you investment advice. I'm here to implore you to look out 3-5 years and ask yourself where you want to be. Whether it be $100, $500, $1000, $5000, $10000, or more that you are sitting on that you want to invest; don't get scared now. 

Do you remember all those times you wished it was cheaper so you could buy more? It's here folks. Now and going forward until the fall stops is when you buy. Keep DCAing. Squeeze that price as low as possible. We are looking at a 50% gain on the upside. It may not be today or tomorrow. Stop chasing the easy wins. Invest.

2025-04-07 05:06:57,r/stocks,Best way to sell tomorrow?,"I'm a long-term buy and hold investor so I've pretty much never sold any of the stocks that I've bought over the past 30 years. I don't want to regret getting out now even during a crash. I'm in my 50's but hadn't been actively looking to retire yet and have rental properties so daily cash flow isn't necessarily an issue but was looking for this for the future when I do retire.

My primary holding is a few thousand shares of Apple that I bought back when they were almost going out of business back in the 90's, so it's fair to say that it's been a spectacular gain for me. But now it makes up way too much of my portfolio and yes I should have been rebalancing all this time but it never seemed like a good time since it kept growing. I was going to start selling off this year but now it's a dire need. It kills me that I could have sold at a higher peak but that's hindsight.

The rest of my holdings include a decent mix of tech and telecom stocks plus index ETFs and a bunch of mutual funds. I have NVDA from right before the recent split and Amazon and Google from early pandemic time (these are likely negative now). Also a bunch of losers like Citi that I've been saving for capital gains offset but those will be a drop in the bucket if I sell all AAPL. These are all in a taxable account but I also have various index ETFs in IRAs.

So I'm looking for advice on what and how to sell off tomorrow. Should I do all the AAPL shares and all the ETFs and misc stocks? I'm thinking that selling everything in the IRA accounts would make sense since those aren't taxable.

Apple is obvious but how to do it in the bloodbath?

I do know how to submit the sell order on my broker website but should it just be sell all shares at market? Submit the orders now before market opens or wake up and watch to see what's happening and set limits on the sell price?

And I think mutual funds redemption is at end of day, how to go about exiting those? Wait and see what happens during the day and submit a redemption request?

This means, it won’t last. It’s a switch. If turned off, we’ll see so much green that our eyes will turn blue. 

People in this group kept asking which stocks to buy, and asking for advice as most stocks were very expensive. Literally so many stocks even value stocks like $MKC who is a value stock, was priced 6 years out with growth. $MKC had a P/E of 28 and growth rate of 1-3% yearly. 

Finally; this creates an opportunity for cheap stocks. If you even dare, buy call options 1-2 years out. 

I purchased $CLF $10 call options, that are out till 2027. Many other call options will be added Monday. This opportunity is one I’ll be telling my kids about when they ask me how we got so rich.

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jckrcz/convince_me_i_shouldnt_be_a_bear_now_pt_2/) March 17. Positions: Cash + protectionist plays (INTC, X, etc). 

Well, this ended up becoming a little trilogy. The market has went down, a lot, and the big question is: 

Is this time to buy?

I think so. I have been, over Thursday and Friday. 

Why?

1. Because these tariffs are bad. They are so bad that, if unchanged, they will cause not only a recession, but I think there will be riots on the streets within 6 months. 

2. Trump -- and the republican party -- are on a timer. Midterms are next year. They need to show results, not a crashing economy. Republicans are already starting to voice discontent. Ted Cruz *openly* stated this could be a ""political bloodbath"". If tariffs stay on, republicans will break ranks. Anything else is political suicide. 

3. This leads me to conclude that tariffs will be removed. Either via Trump or through congressional action. Maybe even impeachment. The result? Markets moon. 

This leads me to 3 scenarios: 

1. Tariffs end quickly via renegotiation or Trump just backing down. I mean, islands with penguins? Seriously? Trump declares victory.

2. Some tariffs (China) stay, many others are removed. Certain industries benefit, others feel pain.

3. Tariffs stay on long enough to necessitate public/congressional intervention. Political chaos, recession, Maga goose cooked.

In scenario 1 and 2, damage is limited and markets ascend quickly. Remember, most gains come from certain days. 
In scenario 3, damage includes a recession. Earnings go down and valuations may retreat to ~16, which is ~4400 on the S&amp;P. We are at 5070 now.

I'm deploying 80% of cash to buy. Keeping 20% safe, just in case.

So far, I've bought financials (KRE, WAL), tech (INTC, NVDA, META), retailers (NKE, RH) and SPY. Also, some LCID and RKLB for funsies. 

Is this the low? I don't know. China and the EU can wait Trump out, I think. Standing up to Trump and tariffs will be domestically popular for them. Which means they will not renegotiate. Which means action must come from the US. 

But, sitting on cash for too long is foolish, unless you live in Omaha. Spy has already fallen from 613 in Feb when I went short; and from 560 in March when I went cash. Things are now a lot more attractive. 

To summarize my theory, I hope that the adults in Washington step up, stop executive overreach, and we all benefit. It might take some time. I suggest writing to your representatives in Congress. I have.

This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

**China announced a 34% tariff on the US. The US may retaliate. ""Reciprocal"" tariffs can result in a positive feedback loop of the tariff percentage.**

News: [China Imposes 34 Tariffs On All Us Imports As Retaliation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-04/china-imposes-34-tariffs-on-all-us-imports-as-retaliation)

**AVGO, NXPI, LRCX, AMAT- ALL OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE 20%+ OF THEIR SALES COME FROM CHINA)**\- China imposing a 34% tariff on US imports escalates trade tensions and impacts supply chains, all of which have significant exposure to China. Overall, most interested in NVDA at $95/$90 and possibly INTC at $20 if we don't spike off the open. I'm leaning more bearish for today due to the news being announced so early premarket from China, and also from the fear of the US announcing additional tariffs.

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&amp;p=d)\- AAPL broke $200 premarket following the announcement- mainly due to approximately 20% of AAPL revenue comingfrom China. I'm interested mainly if it breaks $190 intraday. AAPL relies heavily on China for manufacturing, with over 90% of its production based there and newly imposed tariffs are expected to increase AAPL’s annual costs by $8.5B. China adding more tariffs affects AAPL as it is clearly the biggest MAG7 loser of the tariffs. Main risks involve increased production costs, potential price hikes for consumers, and a possible decline in sales volume because our damn phones get far more expensive. Additionally, further escalation in trade tensions could lead to more severe supply chain disruptions. 

[**VXX (VIX Short-Term Futures ETN)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&amp;p=d)\- I still don't think we've peaked (as I mentioned yesterday). We've spiked to \~$40 on the VIX ($75 on VXX). I'm interested in seeing how the US will respond to China tariffs before making any significant trades. The risk in the VXX short is based on overnight headlines from China announcing more tariffs (which already happened), and now, waiting for the US to retaliate. Fun.

[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&amp;p=d)**,** [**FXI (China Large-Cap ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&amp;p=d)**,** [**YINN (China Bull 3X Shares)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=YINN&amp;p=d)**,** [**YANG (China Bear 3X Shares)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=YANG&amp;p=d)**,** [**JD (JD.com)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JD&amp;p=d)\- China-related stocks are selling off due to expectations of retaliation from the US. Also currently just a ""watch"", everything hinges on if the US backs off from tariffs or if we escalate. Interested in BABA if it hits $100. If the US announces escalation of tariffs, I'm mainly interested in a YANG buy. This is potentially the largest catalyst since COVID, so one tweet can move the market.

2025-04-04 13:03:55,r/stocks,Tariffs will be negotiated away. Buy as much stocks as possible!,"Everyone here is panicking and thinking these tariffs are going to destroy everything. It’s not an incorrect thought… IF they stay in effect for a long period. 

However it’s important to listen to what Trump has said. Trump said he’s open to tarrif cuts if countries offer something phenomenal. He also said now these countries will be coming to us to negotiate rather than the other way around. He used tik tok as an example to say he may cut tarrif on china to close a tik tok deal. 

Trump put these tariffs in effect to give him huge leverage over every country. He even bragged that every country has called him to negotiate. Acting tough like the tariffs will be in place for a few years, is ONLY to increase their leverage. The more difficult it seems to remove tariffs the more negotiating power Trump has. 

This is a rare stock crash where it’s completely self inflicted with the signing of a pen from the president. This means to end this pain will ONLY take the president to end the tariffs- which can be done instantly. 

I am very sure this will be exactly like the Covid crash. He will keep talking a big talk and more and more terrible news will come out. But then there will be cracks as exceptions are made and deals are negotiated. This is literally the man who wrote “Art of the Deal”. He is 100% transactional and is always aiming to make a deal.

Personally I am buying AI stocks like crazy. This is probably the last chance to get on the AI boat before this stuff rockets. SMH, ASML, NVDA, AMZN META—- all these big tech names will come out fine long term. No matter how scary it gets just keep buying.

Tech stocks plummeted on Thursday, with Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)) leading ""Magnificent Seven"" names lower following President Trump's[ reciprocal tariff announcement](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-every-country-facing-reciprocal-tariffs-announced-by-trump-on-liberation-day-231329935.html) the day prior.

Shares of Apple, on track for their worst day since March 2020, cratered over 8% in afternoon trade as the stock erased $300 billion from its market cap. The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.

On Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India — all set to take effect on April 9.

Notably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important [production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.

""Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[ like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.

As trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.

""The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,"" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate ""this new world of tariffs.""

Until then, he warned, ""tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.""

Other Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.

In afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.

Outside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.

""The implications \[of the announced tariffs\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \[chip\] sector,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. ""These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.""

Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.

He added, ""The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP. [So if this tips us into recession, ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.""",214,callsonreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jqpre5/apple_sheds_300_billion_in_tarifffueled_selloff/,1jqpre5

**Stay agile, and be on the lookout for tariff news from Beijing.**

News: [Trump's Tariff Announcement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-04-02/trump-s-tariff-announcement)

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&amp;p=d)\- 34% tariff on Chinese imports, adding to existing duties, brings the total to 54% effective April 9. AAPL relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing, and these tariffs are expected to lead to increased production costs, which will be passed on to consumers through higher prices. Watching $200, but likely the stock I'm going to play if there's any chance of a bounce (in addition to NVDA). These tariffs will result in retaliatory measures from China, further impacting Apple's supply chain and profitability. Additionally, prolonged tariffs could lower consumer demand due to higher prices. Related Tickers: AVGO, SWKS, TSM, QCOM.

[**CRWV (CoreWeave)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&amp;p=d)\- Google is reportedly in advanced discussions to rent Nvidia's Blackwell AI servers from CoreWeave. This potential partnership is huge because it means that CRWV has a little more diversification in their revenue stream (alleviating a huge risk to the company). It's hard, this has risen so much from the IPO but we're back at pre-tariff and pre-announcement prices- have a small long position but likely will exit due to all the craziness today and need to focus on the bigger fish. Despite Taiwanese chips not being tariffed, CRWV will likely benefit due to the rising costs of chips.

[**RH (Restoration Hardware)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RH&amp;p=d)\- Reported EPS of $1.58 vs $1.92 expected. Revenue of $812M vs $829M. The company issued guidance for the current fiscal year, projecting revenue growth of 10% to 13%, an adjusted operating margin between 14% and 15%, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20% to 21%. Management highlighted concerns over a higher-risk business environment due to tariffs, market volatility, and inflation risks, noting that RH has been operating in the ""worst housing market in almost 50 years."" Interested at $150, but won't focus on this today vs AAPL or other Mag7 names that are selling off.

[**VXX (VIX Short-Term Futures ETN)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&amp;p=d)\- The recent spike in volatility attributed to ""Liberation Day"" saw a massive VIX spike along with everything else selling off. Interested in seeing what we do but I doubt today will be the day I take a short position- volatility is coming and is not as likely to be the quick one-day spikes we've seen in the past. We may see additional tariffs from China in retaliation.

[**NKE (Nike)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&amp;p=d)\- Nike is one of the biggest losers due to tariffs, as a substantial portion of its manufacturing is based in Southeast Asian countries facing high tariff rates. Notably, Nike produces nearly 50% of its footwear and 30% of its apparel in Vietnam. Currently long, but will bail if we break new lows (\~$55.20). Prolonged tariffs lead to higher consumer prices, and NKE has cited lowered demand/guidance for its goods due to competitors.

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)\- NVIDIA's exposure to the recent tariff announcements appears limited, as the 32% levy on imports from Taiwan. The White House clarified that semis are exempt from these tariffs, which provides a buffer for NVIDIA's core business and limits downside risk from the new trade measures.

Nvidia Stock Is Falling. Not Even Chip Exemption Saves It From Broad Slump.

2:28 PM-Apr 3

NVDA

By Adam Clark

Nvidia looks set to fall sharply following President Donald Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs on imports to the U.S. The chip maker escaped specific levies but the wider market reaction and fears of Chinese retaliation are set to drag on the shares.

Nvidia shares were down 3.2% at $106.93 in the Thursday premarket having tumbled 5.7% at $104.15 in after-hours trading. The stock rose 0.3% during Wednesday's session.

The tariff announcement wasn't quite as bad as it could have been for Nvidia. Trump said the levy on imports for Taiwan - where Nvidia's chips are mostly manufactured - will be set at 32%. However, the White House published a fact sheet after Trump's announcement that said semiconductors would not be subject to that reciprocal tariff.

That doesn't mean chip tariffs are off the table entirely. Products such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and lumber will be addressed separately, a senior administration official said.

The other major concern is likely to be potential retaliation from Beijing, with Chinese goods now facing total duties of 54% after the latest tariff announcements.

Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices fell 5.8% in after-hours trading and Broadcom was down 6.3%.

Meanwhile, Nvidia on Wednesday said its Blackwell computing platform set performance records in tests for inferencing - the process of generating output from Al models - carried out by MLCommons, an open engineering consortium.

There has been speculation over whether Nvidia's dominant position in Al chips would weaken as the focus shifts from training Al models to inference. The company has pushed back hard against that, noting inference makes up around 40% of its data-center revenue and is growing fast. It says that its NVL72 server system delivers a fourfold improvement in Al model training but up to a 30 times improvement in inference compared with previous systems.

Not much has changed for Nvidia in the last many quarters - pole position, big moat, high margins, inventory remains sold out for near future, no real competitor that can provide the combination of {Performant Chips, Data architecture, and a near certainty of what the pipeline looks like for the next 2 years}, which is key for most large customers to plan their Capex. It's not AMD, or Intel has an alternative, either. 

And yet, every quarter, we have wild swings. 

I can understand swings for Tesla or other companies affected by tariffs to actual fall in revenues or growth. Doesn't look like that applies to Nvidia, at least for now. TSM's moving to the US reduces their net risk. The only negative thing I hear is that Blackwell is ramping up, and margins are down (from 76% to 73%, like really?).

They also had the largest funding round in history, $40 Billion raised. Where is the **$40 BILLION** going to go? my guess is NVDA, maybe AVGO for custom chips.

We are still in the relatively new stages of large language models and we still have chip shortages, when robotics's development expands the shortage will persist. 

If OpenAI has stortages, i imagine everyone else does as well. 

Long NVDA, AVGO and TSM.

2025-04-02 00:26:35,r/stocks,Bought NVDA at the wrong time? Not sure what to do next,"Hi everyone,

I know absolutely nothing about investing. My understanding is just: I buy stocks, they can go up or down, and I either make or lose money.

On January 6th, I bought 73 shares of NVIDIA. I had heard from friends that they made good money with it, so I thought I’d try it too.

I’m from Brazil, and I paid BRL 1,381.61. Now my investment is worth BRL 951.92 — that’s a loss of BRL 429.24.

Looking at the chart on Google, it seems like I got unlucky and bought right before it dropped.

My question is: should I just accept the loss and take my money out before it drops more? Or should I leave it there and hope for the best?

I honestly have no clue what might happen next, and to be honest, I’m not really interested in learning more about investing — I just want to make a reasonable decision here.

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Based on the comments, I think it's important to clarify that I didn't have any specific goal with this investment — I just wanted to grow my money over the long term. I was aware of the risk of losing money, so I only invested an amount I was comfortable with potentially losing. From what I've read in the comments, it seems like holding onto these shares for the long term might actually be a good idea (Apparently even buying more haha).",0,guilhermeqcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jp8s83/bought_nvda_at_the_wrong_time_not_sure_what_to_do/,1jp8s83

2025-03-31 15:44:59,r/NVDA_Stock,Questions for longs re: data center and robotics opportunity,"on Q4 call, Jensen talks about data center and robotics opportunity as trillion dollar+ markets.

But recent interview of CEO of Figure AI robotics co, was asked point blank about value of NVDA and says there are ""potentially other options.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFi2TQ9uDK8. at 19:11 mark.

Also, new CAPX data centers are getting cut back obviously and even more importantly, even if you can build it takes 2-3 years to build out (so 2028-2029 at least?).

Which leaves you w/converting/upgrading existing data centers.  Which I want to believe but the more I think about it, I wonder what % of data center floor space is even ripe for conversion?  I mean, isn't most of the space for traditional hosting of private and public networks?  It's not like you can cannibalize existing hosting for trad enterprise apps (ERP, etc.).

And now AMZN (long) is aggressively trying to convert NVDA customers.

So, my question(s) are:

1. is NVDA really required for robotics?  Seems maybe not.
2. Is there really a trillion $ opp with Data centers?  Seems more like fraction of smaller %
3. Do we really think AMZN et al won't be going for the jugular?  Highly doubt it.

FWIW, I'm long $90 for $150K and $127 for $200K but i'd love some perspective from folks that have more understanding from the ground.",4,Wise_Capital_7638,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1jo3j9b/questions_for_longs_re_data_center_and_robotics/,1jo3j9b

News: [US Stock Futures Tumble Ahead Of New Trump Tariffs: Markets Wrap ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-30/us-stock-futures-tumble-ahead-of-new-trump-tariffs-markets-wrap)

[**SPY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&amp;p=d)**,** [**QQQ** ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&amp;p=d)**,** [**VXX** ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&amp;p=d)**,** [**USO**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=USO&amp;p=d) , larger tech stocks - ""Liberation day"" (additional tariffs) is nearing, causing the market to selloff due to fears of escalating trade tensions and potential global growth impacts . We're pretty close to near lows from 3/13 (18 days ago, lol). 

Overall will be trying to buy a bounce for a day trade if we do end up breaking, but probably will be more focused on a VXX short rather than buying the market overall. I'm interested if we selloff or pop on the open, if we break new lows I may short/then flip long. This kind of headline-driven macro environment is a pain in the ass to keep track of, but creates a lot more opportunity for short-term trading. Risks that can change the tariff narrative or move the market include unexpected retaliation from trade partners, weakening consumer/investor confidence (like last week's numbers), and spillover into energy and commodity prices (Trump has signaled some action on oil, but we aren't sure what yet). 

**NVDA**[ **(Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)\- Another interesting thing that caught my eye this morning are reports from Chinese media that NVDA's new chip (GB300) are significantly delayed due to complexity and may be a quarter or two delayed (thus resulting in missed/delayed revenue). This could explain why NVDA is down significantly more (-3.5%) vs other semis. 

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d) \- Analysts have trimmed Q1 delivery estimates for TSLA amid weakening demand trends and delays in its Model Q vehicle (the cheap, Robotoaxi car). There have also been articles of divestment from pension/investing funds that are invested in TSLA that I've read, but whether those are serious, I'd hold judgement on. 

Delivery numbers are expected Wednesday and typically report premarket, so good to be cognizant of that. I'm interested in seeing if we can hold below $250 today. The EV sector in general has entered a consolidation phase, with cost competition and flagging consumer incentives weighing on demand, and BYD is hot on TSLA's heels and likely going to overtake TSLA within the year. Below-consensus deliveries could spark a guidance reset for earnings, margin compression of their other cars due to the Model Q, and market share loss in China and Europe are key concerns. Also random people torching Tesla dealerships.

[**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&amp;p=d) \- No material news catalyst, but PLTR has experienced five consecutive red sessions and is likely moving with the overall stock rout. Worth noting that PLTR cut close to 60% of its IT Team (said by CTO in recent interview), and DoD cut close to $600M in spending (which affects PLTR). Also worth noting that we are EXACTLY right back to where we started before we had significant retail interest in this stock ($80). The broader AI/data analytics sector has seen a pullback after a multi-month run and has been somewhat outpaced rational valuation so not too interested in this for the long term.

I suppose this can be delayed through tarrifs but long term, it looks like Tesla is cooked.

BYD sells cars twice as good for half the price.

2025-03-28 06:04:59,r/NVDA_Stock,Positive news for Nvidia,"MSFT is adding reasoning into Copilot. Copilot has not been very successful but DeepSeek showed how LLM with reasoning can significantly improve the intelligence of AI. DeepSeek is actually a great development for Nvidia contrary to the people parroting how DeepSeek is detrimental to Nvidia. This is because better AI results in more use case and adoption. The training of reasoning model is not resource intensive but it significantly increase the time required for AI to reply and increase demand for inferencing. For the service provider, it means lower training cost but higher cost to provide the service. 

OpenAI latest update is a huge success with the remark ""our GPUs are melting"". This should translate to more subscription and OpenAI looking to using Blackwell and perhaps even working with Nvidia to help optimise their algorithms further.

2025-03-28 04:55:42,r/NVDA_Stock,"NVDA faces resistance, is the downtrend still in play?","Based on technical analysis, price has recently declined to the lower boundary of the channel, suggesting potential support, and here's my take on NVDA's current price action and technical outlook:

* The price of NVDA is currently facing resistance at the upsloping trendline, which has historically acted as a dynamic barrier. Despite the upward slope, the trendline is now rejecting price advances, reinforcing its role as resistance.
* Near to this upsloping trendline, price has made a bearish chart pattern resembling a double top.
* Downtrend Intact: Despite the recent rebound, NVDA remains in a downtrend, forming consecutive lower highs.
* Resistance at 130: Price is currently resisted by the upsloping trendline. Even if NVDA moves higher toward 130, it is still facing strong resistance, keeping the downtrend structure intact.
* Support at 100-103: The key support zone remains at 100-103, where buyers previously stepped in. If this level is tested again, it will be crucial to see whether it holds.

i'm considering going long NVDL(GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF) for short-term trading on tiger if price approaches support, anticipating a bounce, or to short NVDL if there's clear price rejection at resistance levels, what do you think?

2025-03-28 04:07:37,r/stocks,"CoreWeave, the biggest IPO of 2025. (DD on $CRWV)","# I love IPOs.

The last IPO I thought was amazing was ARM (and how far we've come!).  Coreweave (IPOing on the 28th!) is another one I think has a ton of potential. (I wrote the majority of this before the reduced IPO sizing so please forgive me if my math is incorrect).

CoreWeave is a cloud infrastructure provider specializing in GPU computing, called an “AI hyperscaler.” They run data centers full of GPUs and rent out that computing power to customers via the cloud. Similar to AWS/Azure, but they're focused on AI/ML/GPU tasks like making stupid Studio Ghibli pictures of yourself.

CRWV started in 2017 mining ETH but pivoted to being a GPU farm in 2019 after the crash. By 2022, they fully exited crypto mining and doubled down on enterprise GPU cloud services​. This early mover advantage in GPU hosting, (along with all the GPUs they bought from NVDA), have made it a player in the the cloud services space.

CRWV makes money by charging for usage-based cloud compute - clients pay for GPU hours on their servers.​ Initially, they served niches like VFX studios (movies like Interstellar take millions of GPU hours to render), but now AI training and inference workloads are the main growth driver​.

Companies like META/IBM/MSFT have used CRWV for AI compute needs in the past​. CRWV's differentiator is through software- they claim custom scheduling software (e.g. a system called “SUNK” and an optimizer “Tensorizer”) that yields better hardware utilization, faster container spin-ups, and higher throughput than general-purpose which makes them more efficient to use.

In practice, that means a customer training a large ML model might get results faster or cheaper on CRWV than on AWS. CRWV currently operates 32 data centers with 250k+ NVDA GPUs and are very aggressive in acquiring them- they deploy A100, H100, and H200s and are prioritized as customers of NVDA.

**The NVDA Relationship**

NVDA backs CRWV, and they're strong partners (which means they prioritize each other over other customers). Due to this, I dismiss the possibility that CRWV will ever have troubles on the supply side of obtaining GPUs. Something that is fairly common knowledge is that NVDA (and other companies) prefer selling GPUs in bulk because it simplifies customer service and they can charge for enterprise support and  sell thousands at a time. It's also why NVDA spits on the face of their gaming customers.

**Isn't it kind of shady that NVDA both invests and is a customer of CRWV? Why doesn't NVDA use their own chips instead of renting capacity from CRWV?**

Kind of. Nothing they've done is outright illegal (even using their GPUs as collateral is within the law). Even companies that build GPUs need to rent compute when there's a massive amount of demand. MSFT did it, NVDA did it, OpenAI WILL do it. CRWV signed a direct deal with OpenAI: a multi-year commitment up to $11.9 B for GPU cloud capacity​. They have ties to the major AI players. This entire DD going forward assumes that they will continue to keep their relationship with NVDA because NVDA needs them so AWS doesn't swallow the entire market. 

**The Financials**

CRWV has had ridiculous growth- In 2022, they had revenue of $15.8 M (the majority of which came from ETH mining). In 2023, their GPU computing pivot led to revenue of $229M, then $1.9B in 2024. This was obviously fueled by the release of ChatGPT as demand for GPU compute exploded as other companies scrambled to compete with their OWN LLM models.

By 2024, CRWV neared $2 B in annual sales, transforming from a niche player to a major cloud provider in two years.

The financial issue is that CRWV is unprofitable as it scales. In 2023, it lost \~$600M, and in 2024m \~$860M. For every $1 of revenue in 2024, they spent about $1.45 for huge investments in data centers, GPUs, and the associated operating costs (plus interest on debt they've taken out which they have a ton of).

The S-1 shows operating costs close to \~$1B from tech/infra in 2024, which includes data center space, buying/depreciating their GPUs, electricity costs, maintenance staff, etc. The capex is massive and is funded largely by debt.

The cash burn is brutal as well- at the end of 2024 CRWV still has negative FCF (which is normal for a pre-ipo high growth tech startup) and is betting that they will eventually claw their way to profitability despite the brutal looking financials (like Uber, Snowflake, Robinhood, insert your choice of tech startup here lol). The bet is that high upfront investment now will secure long-term contracts and scale to profitability later, like most tech IPOs.

**Customer Concentration**

In 2023, Microsoft accounted for \~35% of CRWV’s revenue​. In 2024, that grew to \~62% of total revenue​. Their S-1 mentioned that close to \~80% of their revenue comes from two customers alone. But this is a warning sign because MSFT wants to build their own (hence their announcement of spending \~$80B in 2025 for AI data centers).

**If MSFT scales back their use of CRWV then they are frankly fucked.** MSFT's CEO also mentioned that using external capacity (like CRWV) for GPUs was a short-term stopgap until their own investment in Azure pays off.

However, the OpenAI deal (remember that OpenAI is 49% owned by MSFT) could take the place of MSFT going forward. The contract is up to $11.9B through 2030​, which averages out to \~$2B/year if used, which is equivalent to all of CRWV's 2024 revenue.  If OpenAI maximizes their usage, CRWV’s revenue could potentially double at minimum if MSFT doesn't pull out. This is a wild hopium optimistic case but I thought it was worth mentioning.

Beyond those two, CRWV has other customers that make up the \~20% of 2024 revenue). These include research labs, VFX studios, and other tech companies but none are individually as large compared to the MSFT/OpenAI. What will make or break this company in the long run is the diversification of the client base because all their eggs are in one basket.

**IPO Technicals**

CRWV sold 37.5M shares at $40/share, getting $1.5B and giving it a $20B valuation. That was below CRWV's official target of offering 49M shares at $47-$55, raising up to $2.7B at $32B valuation​. This signals a lack of interest in the initial offering and is not great news if you already hold the stock, but is excellent if you're a short term trader that wants to see a pop on IPO day- the stock has more room to run. Yes, this means it's good for retail, bad for insiders.

**Valuation/Comparables**

Is a \~$20B valuation reasonable for CRWV? You can do a rough comparison:

|**Company**|Annual Revenue (2024)|**Recent Valuation**|**EV/Revenue Multiple**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**CoreWeave** (CRWV)|$1.92 B|\~$20B (target IPO)|\~10×|
|**Snowflake** (SNOW)|$3.41 B​|\~$52 B (market cap)|\~15× ​|
|**Databricks**\*|\~$3 B by end of 2025|\~$62 B ​|\~20×|
|**AWS** (AMZN)|$107.6 B​|\~$500 B|\~4-5×|

(That's not a typo- AWS is valued at \~$500B, it's the main driver of AMZN's growth, yet struggles to grow because it's already massive). \*Also note that Databricks is a private company

I think that if the company can maintain a hyper-growth trajectory (e.g. 2-3× growth for a couple more years), then an 10× multiple now could look cheap in hindsight. For instance, 2025 revenue could hit \~$4 B+ with the OpenAI ramp and other clients. Of course, we have risks like growth decelerating, and tariffs and Trump and China that could come in and decimate growth. And of course, they're not profitable (for now). Ironically, CRWV and other US firms would BENEFIT from chip restrictions because they'd be prioritized over the overseas ones that use NVDA chips.

CRWV’s valuation is aggressive (dare I say fair for a hyperscaler), but in line  with other cloud providers. The entire short term bull thesis depends on them retaining MSFT as a customer and also keeping OpenAI- if that occurs then investing in it now looks like a no-brainer. If not, **it's completely possible we see an 50%+ selloff. I think that's the reason why we're seeing such hesitancy in this valuation.**

This valuation is also dependent on entirely dependent on AI spending GROWING, society seeing greater integration in AI (more than we have now), and AI firms willing to continue spending on compute they can't harness themselves. We are still supply constrained on GPUs in general, and if we ever experience NVDA building more GPUs than there is demand for, then Coreweave's margins are threatened and profitability can vanish. For now, it looks like that is unlikely to happen.

**IPO Trading Details**

37.5M shares is decent IPO volume so I don't expect this to be illiquid when it trades. The main things I watch for are indication price (whether there are people who want to buy the print of the stock higher than what we IPO at) and share paired (which somewhat signal when the IPO will open for trading).

Overall, this is a pure AI play on GPU compute, a bet that demand for GPUs will continue to outstrip supply,  and that MSFT/OpenAI/every other tech firm involved won't slit their throat in in the eternal game of thrones that is capitalism.

**TL;DR:** There's a hell of a lot of risk, but I like the stock. It's completely possible it could open and sell off because the insiders just want to bail. It's possible that it skyrockets. Anything is possible in the wild and crazy world of IPO trading.

2025-03-25 23:14:10,r/stocks,Stocks Close Higher for 3rd Straight Day; Tesla Surges in Late Trading to Extend Rally,"
Major indexes closed slightly higher Tuesday as the stock market continued its recovery from an extended selloff.

The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose fractionally. Stocks had kicked off the week with big gains following news that President Trump could scale back some of the tariffs that are due to be imposed next week on U.S. trading partners. With the recent gains, the Dow has inched back into positive territory for 2025, as stocks have rebounded from a month-long selloff spurred by concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.

Investors brushed off consumer confidence data released this morning that came in weaker than expected, with the index hitting its lowest level in more than four years. Investors are closing watching all data points amid worries that tariffs could reignite inflation and cause economic growth to stall. The big economic report of the week comes Friday with the scheduled release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had fallen during the recent stock market rout amid the growing concerns about the economy, was at 4.32% in late trading, down from 4.33% at yesterday's close and from an earlier high Tuesday of 4.37%. The yield, which affects costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, hit its highest level in more than a month this morning.

Mega-cap technology stocks, which helped lead Monday's rally, were mostly higher again today. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied late in the day to finish 3.5% higher, gaining ground for the 5th consecutive session, despite news Tuesday that the EV maker's sales in Europe continued to slide. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) each rose more than 1%, while Microsoft (MSFT) inched ahead. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) closed slightly lower

2025-03-22 20:17:09,r/stocks,Honest question from long term investor,"I’ve been a long term investor for decades. I’m in solid stocks including the M7. My question, “Should I pull out of at least my M7 (already cashed out TSLA) from the market to cash and reenter well after April 6th?”  So at this point I’m up on all my long term stocks ranging from 39% to 167% as I’ve been is a long time. So nothing would be at a loss. I just feel we are facing a man made intentional potential crash of US stocks. Could be short term or long term. One issue, I’m also near retirement age so I don’t have 20 years to wait for a correction. 
Let me further say all my eggs are not in one basket. I’m fully diversified with only 1/3 of my liquid assets in stock. Because of my age 2/3 is in very safe such as CD’s near 5%. Also 2 houses paid off, nice car paid off, zero debt on credit cards paid off monthly. 
But I can’t make a misstep. My portfolio will be 1/2 of the income I will rely on for income in a few years. 


I know we are not supposed to make rash decisions based on “feelings” but it’s more than that, I’m reading nonstop everything about this market and as an older person I feel like I’m seeing a potential 2008 all over again. I wisely went cash then. And in 2010 bought my house for only  42% of it was valued in 2006. Now it’s worth 5 times what I paid for it. 

So anyone who has weathered a few markets, what’s your take? Is cashing out Apple,Amazon,NVDA for instance a crazy move right now? ",30,This_Possession8867,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jhg8n8/honest_question_from_long_term_investor/,1jhg8n8

Overall, mainly earnings today.

[**NKE (Nike)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&amp;p=d) \- EPS of $0.54 vs. $0.30 expected. Revenue of $11.3B vs. $11.02B expected. Despite beating expectations, sales/profits declined YoY in NA/China/Online. NKE gave a negative earnings outlook, and stated Q4 revenue would decline low-to-mid-teens (10-15%), mainly due to margin pressure from new tariffs. Pretty brutal move. I remember earnings from last year were pretty bad mainly due to weaker demand in China/Online segments. Overall a victim of tariffs, I don't consider this investible for now but things will change if we get any new news regarding tariffs, which are the main headwinds here. IIRC 25% of NKE's shoes are made in China.

[**NIO**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NIO&amp;p=d)**-** Revenue of $2.7B in Q4 2024. Vehicle deliveries rose 45.2% YoY (including Onvo vehicles). Net loss widened to RMB 7.11B, a 32.5% YoY increase. Despite the increase in cars sold, they suffered a loss of \~$1B. They've never been profitable since they've started, so reading a little deeper into their reports, there's still concern about liquidity due to current liabilities being higher than current assets this year (a very bad sign when you want to borrow). They cited EV demand in China remains strong, especially in the premium BEV segment. NIO holds a 40% market share in the $40K-$50K car segment (I'm rounding here after conversion).

2025-03-21 01:54:15,r/stocks,Short sellers have made $15 billion betting against Tesla and Nvidia in 2025,"Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Tesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven — which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) — is underperforming the S&amp;P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

Now, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.

""Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,"" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. ""But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market. They are not going away.""

I do have NVDA and AMD at the moment, but pretty small positions.

  
I like the idea of having a few more speculative low cap stock like APLD and I like how NVDA backed them with some funding, which shows me they have some faith in that company. Can get a good amount of shares and hold for a big rally up if the company takes off in the future. Something that I dont need to put a lot of money into which can have a massive increase.

I also like the other 3 because of a few different reasons, but I noticed they had some very large rallies recently, for example NOW.

I liked Cadence because what Jensen said yesterday that they would be looking to hire a lot of designers from Cadence for all their future needs, which makes me believe that company has something special Jensen sees in them.

  
I want to know what you guys think about these 4, or any other AI/Data center stocks you know of that would be good to watch. Im pretty unfamiliar with the AI space and im gathering as much information as I can on this subject.",3,Interr0gate,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jf0xn9/looking_to_get_into_some_more_aidata_center/,1jf0xn9
2025-03-19 06:55:08,r/stocks,Trump’s Trade War 2.0: The Stocks I’m Watching,"With Trump back in office and tariffs returning in full force, I’ve been analyzing what this means for U.S. equities. His latest moves—25% steel and aluminum tariffs, expanded levies on Chinese imports, and a tariff-heavy negotiation strategy—echo his first term but with even **stronger measures**.



While 2018-2020 gave us some clues, the market setup in 2025 is **different**:

• **Higher inflation &amp; rates:** Tariffs add inflationary pressure, making the Fed’s job harder.

• **China’s response will change:** Unlike in 2018, China now **dominates EV battery production** and **controls rare earth supply chains**—this could hurt U.S. tech more than before.

• **Supply chain resilience is mixed:** Companies have talked about reshoring for years, but it’s still expensive and slow.

Given these factors, here’s how I’m positioning:

**Likely Winners:**

1. **Steel &amp; Aluminum (NUE, STLD, CLF)** – Tariffs give them pricing power, though cost inflation is a risk.

2. **Defense &amp; Cybersecurity (LMT, PLTR, CRWD)** – “America First” likely means **higher defense budgets**.

3. **Regional Banks (JPM, BAC, GS)** – If deregulation follows, these should gain.

4. **Domestic Infrastructure (CAT, DE, OSK)** – If tariffs hurt foreign suppliers, U.S. construction demand rises.



**Likely Losers:**

1. **Tech Giants (AAPL, NVDA, QCOM, INTC)** – Heavy China exposure = supply chain and revenue risks.

2. **Consumer Goods (NKE, WMT, DG)** – Imports get pricier, and passing costs to lower-income customers is tough.

3. **Auto &amp; Industrial (TSLA, GM, F, MMM)** – Higher input costs + China retaliation = pain.

4. **Agri Exporters (ADM, TSN, BG)** – If China targets U.S. farm products again, these get hit.



**What I’m watching:**

📌 Will China retaliate with rare earth metal export bans? (Impacts TSLA, NVDA, QCOM)

📌 Do inflation expectations rise, pushing Fed policy hawkish? (Bad for rate-sensitive stocks)

📌 Does Trump backtrack on any tariffs? (A la 2019)

📌 Will domestic manufacturing gains **outweigh** supply chain disruptions?

I’d love to hear counterpoints. Which stocks do you think will **outperform or underperform** in Trump’s Trade War 2.0?",250,notllmchatbot,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jeqaup/trumps_trade_war_20_the_stocks_im_watching/,1jeqaup
2025-03-18 20:24:20,r/stocks,NVDA: Groot N1 our foundation model for humanoid robots will be open source,"It was announced on stage as the last big news of Jensen's presentation.

&gt;Nvidia is releasing what it’s calling an AI foundation model for humanoid robotics.

&gt; Announced at GTC 2025, the model, dubbed Groot N1, is a “generalist” model — trained on synthetic data and real data. Nvidia said that Groot N1 features a “dual system architecture” for “thinking fast and slow,” inspired by human cognitive processes.
&gt; 
&gt; Groot N1’s slow thinking system lets a robot perceive and reason about its environment and instructions and then plan the right actions to take, according to Nvidia. As for the fast thinking system, it translates the aforementioned plan into robotic actions, including the ability to manipulate objects and execute multi-step sequences.
&gt; 
&gt; The model is available in open source, Nvidia said. Alongside the model, Nvidia is releasing simulation frameworks and blueprints for generating synthetic training data. ([Tech Crunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/18/nvidia-announces-groot-n1-a-foundation-model-for-humanoid-robotics/))

TSM has proposed a joint venture to Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom to operate Intel's foundry division, with TSM managing the operations but holding less than a 50% stake. We saw INTC make a decent bounce in the overnight yesterday on that news, but it looks like we're giving back most of those gains. This move comes as Intel faces significant losses in its manufacturing division, the CHIPS Act is targeted by Trump, so frankly a very good positive catalyst but I don't expect much to come of this. The possibility of a joint venture between these 4 companies actually happening seems fantastical, especially with Trump stating that he wants to scrap the CHIPS Act and instead work on tariffs on semis. 

[**RDDT (Reddit Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RDDT&amp;p=d)

Loop Capital has maintained a buy rating on Reddit Inc. (RDDT), citing strong core fundamentals and a 71% year-over-year sales growth. I don't normally pay attention to these buy/sell ratings but I did notice this was during one of the worst selloffs for RDDT and the market downturn, so it was *a little* more significant than normal.  The company's stock has experienced a nearly 50% decline from recent highs within the past month. I thought this was interesting yesterday near the open so I bought some stock, overall still holding but interested to see where it goes after the open. Also worth noting, Reddit's plans to monetize its subscriber base are expected to boost revenue (I see them competing with Patreon/Substack/Onlyfans). This is overall a pretty positive catalyst, not much risk to it beyond additional negative news coming in for the broader tech sector.

Google has unveiled Gemma 3, a new AI model designed for developers to create applications capable of running efficiently on various devices, including those powered by Nvidia GPUs. I'm also long NVDA a little more- GOOG hasn't pulled back as much as I expected compared to NVDA, but this is pointedly good news. We're also seeing a minor market bounce but whether that can hold is up in the air. Going to sell out if we break new lows in the market. Another model in the arms race that can be run on a SINGLE device is massive news, especially considering the model's competitiveness with Deepseek R1. This is overall positive news but there's always the chance that Deepseek releases an even better model in the future even though the $13M training costs have been debunked.

2025-03-12 13:35:38,r/stocks,"TSMC pitched Intel foundry JV to Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom","TSMC (2330.TW), has pitched U.S. chip designers Nvidia (NVDA.O),, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), and Broadcom (AVGO.O), about taking stakes in a joint venture that would operate Intel's (INTC.O), factories, according to four sources familiar with the matter.

Under the proposal, the Taiwanese chipmaking giant would run the operations of Intel's foundry division, which makes chips adapted for the needs of customers, but it would not own more than 50%, the sources said. Qualcomm (QCOM.O), has also been pitched by TSMC, according to one of the sources and a separate source.

The talks, which are at an early stage, come after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration requested TSMC, the world's leading contract chipmaker, assist in turning around the troubled U.S. industrial icon, the sources said on condition of anonymity because the talks are not public.

The details of the plan for TSMC to take no more than a 50% stake and its overtures to potential partners are being reported for the first time.

Any final deal - the value of which is unclear - would need approval from the Trump administration, which does not want Intel or its foundry division to be fully foreign-owned, the sources said.

Intel, TSMC, Nvidia, AMD and Qualcomm declined to comment. The White House and Broadcom did not respond to requests for comment.

At stake is the future of the U.S. chipmaking giant, whose shares have lost more than half of their value in the last year.

Intel reported a 2024 net loss of $18.8 billion, its first since 1986, driven by large impairments. The foundry division's property and plant equipment had a book value of $108 billion as of December 31, according to a company filing.

Intel stock rose more than 7% in premarket U.S. trading on Wednesday, while Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom and Qualcomm were up between 0.8% and 1.5%. TSMC closed about 1.8% higher in Taiwan.

Trump is keen to revive Intel's fortunes, as he seeks to boost American advanced manufacturing, three of the sources said.

The sources said TSMC's joint venture pitch was made to potential backers before the Taiwanese chipmaker announced with Trump on March 3 that the company planned to make a fresh $100 billion investment in the United States that involves building five additional chip facilities there in coming years.

Talks about the joint venture over Intel's foundry division have since continued, the three sources said, with TSMC looking to have more than one chip designer as a partner.

Multiple companies have expressed interest in buying parts of Intel, but two of the four sources said the U.S. company has rejected discussions about selling its chip design house separately from the foundry division.

Qualcomm has exited earlier discussions to buy all or part of Intel, according to those people and a separate source.

Intel board members have backed a deal and held negotiations with TSMC, while some executives are firmly opposed, according to two sources.

Intel's contract manufacturing business, or foundry division, was a crucial part of former CEO Pat Gelsinger's effort to save Intel. Gelsinger was forced out by the board in December, which named two interim co-CEOs who have mothballed its forthcoming AI chip.

Any deals between historical rivals TSMC and Intel would face major challenges and be costly and laborious. The two companies currently use vastly different processes, chemicals, and chipmaking tool setups at their factories, according to separate sources at the companies.

Intel has previously had manufacturing partnerships with Taiwan's UMC (2303.TW), and Israel's Tower Semiconductor (TSEM.TA), that could offer a precedent for the two companies to operate together, but it remains unclear how such a partnership would work regarding trade manufacturing secrets.

The Taiwanese chipmaker wants potential investors in the joint venture to also be Intel advanced manufacturing customers, according to one of the sources.

Reuters reported last week, citing sources, that Nvidia and Broadcom are running manufacturing tests with Intel, using the company's most advanced production techniques, known as 18A. AMD is also evaluating whether Intel's 18A manufacturing process is suitable for it.

But 18A has been an area of contention in negotiations between Intel and TSMC, two sources said. During talks in February, Intel executives told TSMC that its advanced 18A manufacturing technology was superior to TSMC's 2-nanometer process, according to those sources.

Saw these move mainly due to recession fears and the entire market panicking, MASSIVE move yesterday.

Yesterday, mainly traded TSLA on the overnight exchanges. It had the largest move and got down to around $212. Overall a lot of negative sentiment ranging from boycotts and Elon controversies. Not too interested in trading TSLA today again.  I'm interested in NVDA if we break below 100 but again I think that we'll mainly see a small bounce today rather than breaking new lows. As for RDDT, we're 50% down from highs! Interesting swing candidate but will see how today goes. To me these are the standout stocks yesterday to trade due to recession fears. I don't really see a way out for TSLA regarding the boycotts. We've also seen a decently large move in the VIX (VXX) and we're close to above 60- I'm interested in shorting if we're above $60 but doubt we'll hit that today.

CEO/co-founder, Dustin Moskovitz announced retirement. The company reported Q4 revenues of $188.3M, a 10% YoY increase, and issued a revenue outlook for fiscal 2026 below expectations (resulting in the drop).

That drop was close to 25%, mainly because Dustin owns close to 54% of the company, which signals a LOT of uncertainty and lack of faith in the company. Overall outlook is decently disappointing, and I'm mainly interested in it if we break $11.50 and very interested in buying $10.

**Ticker:** [**AAL (American Airlines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAL&amp;p=d)

AAL projected a higher-than-expected Q1 loss and revised its revenue outlook downward, attributing the weaker forecast to softness in the domestic leisure segment. This is probably amplified by fears of flying, mainly due to people being terrified of all the plane accidents that have happened in 2025. Recession fears also lead to people cutting their vacations/discretionary spending and saving money, so things may get worse. Overall we're seeing a slight recovery in the premarket but still watching to see how this trades.

“due too uncertainty companies will halt hiring and due to increased operating costs companies will stop advertising”

Meaning companies like Meta or Reddit will suffer.

But then in the case if companies likes NVDA, the AI front runner. How will tariffs affect the sales of chips? 

Basically if you have a company and a thesis of how it will be specifically positively or negatively by this somewhat extreme environment. 

P.S. You do not need to comment “no one knows for sure” because everyone already knows that.

**Ticker:** [**AVGO (Broadcom)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AVGO&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Earnings. Reported EPS of $1.60 vs. $1.49 exp, revenue of $14.92B vs. $14.61B expected. AVGO gave strong guidance of $14.9B vs $14.76B. Cited strong growth due to AI chips and/infrastructure components for training AI.

**Technicals:** Watching to see if we break $200 level today.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** I think we're seeing the AI hype become more concentrated in the ""winners"" of the AI race now. There are some companies that ARE citing falling demand for their AI related products while others are stating that demand is still robust. Likely going to see greater consolidation in the future. Major chipmakers like Broadcom are benefiting from hyperscaler investments in AI over the 3 year AI boom.

**Technicals:** LUNR sold off close to 40% yesterday, watching to see if we break the lows at $6.70 premarket. We had 3 major spikes (2 went to the lower) and I'm interested in seeing if we can make any form of recovery today.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** These exploratory spaceflight companies are insanely volatile and depend on their spaceflights doing well- as seen yesterday.

News: [Trump Hails Tariffs as US Economy Barrels Into Trade Wars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-05/trump-to-tout-tariffs-unveil-energy-mineral-projects-in-speech)

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)**,** [**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&amp;p=d)**,** [**SMH (Semiconductor ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMH&amp;p=d)**,** [**SOXL (3x Semiconductor ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SOXL&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Trump has called for an end to the CHIPS Act Subsidy Program (instead preferring tariffs).

**Technicals:** Short biased. Obviously this takes away a lot of investment in semis companies. Extremely negative catalyst but unlikely it will get repealed due to how much bipartisan support it had.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The CHIPS and Science Act gave $280B in new funding to boost domestic research/manufacturing of semis in the US, and also aimed to strengthen supply chain resilience against China and widely considered to be a success because it spurred the development/dominance in the semis sector in America.

**Risks:** If this gets repealed, we're likely going to see a pretty large pullback in the semis. Obviously this is dependent on what the tariffs Trump touts will do as well. [I wrote a little more about my take on a different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j437g9/trump_calls_for_end_to_52_billion_chips_act/) but overall more of the same (I think it's a terrible idea).

**Ticker:** [**GM (General Motors)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GM&amp;p=d)**,** [**F (Ford Motor Company)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&amp;p=d)**,** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** The Trump administration is considering granting relief from the recently imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports for products that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

**Technicals:** We've seen all three stocks (GM especially) make gains due to this announcement, will watch at open for volume.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The automotive industry in US/Canada/Mexico involves the most economic/manufacturing cooperation in the USMCA, they're the most obvious beneficiaries of this potential catalyst.

**Risks:** If they don't actually give relief, then will likely pullback- cars are one of the most affected products of tariffs and pretty much every car company has spoken about tariffs on their earnings calls.

**Ticker:** [**IBIT (IBIT)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=IBIT&amp;p=d)**,** [**COIN (Coinbase)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&amp;p=d)**,** [**HOOD (Robinhood Markets)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has indicated that Trump plans to grant the main biggest CC a ""unique status"" within the Bitcoin reserve strategy, which will be unveiled at the White House Crypto Summit on Friday.

**Technicals:** We've seen the underlying spike close to 8-9% since yesterday, watching $90K level. Interested to see how we go prior to the actual summit.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Obviously an extremely bullish catalyst, we've bounced strongly off the $80K level recently. I usually trade through the ETFs as needed, and HOOD/Coinbase serve as proxies in case the ETFs aren't liquid or have already moved.

**Risks:** Worth waiting for the catalyst and watching the CC Summit on Friday. I personally see this more of a ""buy on hype"" kind of catalyst, unless there's an announcement of something extremely bullish I'm not sure how much more this will move the needle.

**Ticker:** [**HII (Huntington Ingalls Industries)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HII&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Trump has announced initiatives aimed at strengthening the U.S. shipbuilding industry to counter China's dominance, spoke about the creation of a White House Office of Shipbuilding and the introduction of special tax incentives.

**Technicals:** None that I'm particularly interested in, this is a longer-term play.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China produces over half of the world's merchant vessels, this is more of a play to reduce reliance on foreign-shipping.

**Risks:** There's a chance that this will never happen, Trump tried to create a ""Cybersecurity Department"" in his first term but that was never formally created and we kept those duties spread out between the FBI/DHS/NSA. But we also have the Space Force so... stay tuned.

2025-03-04 15:54:22,r/stocks,Why do one-day comparative performance graphs not start at 0%?,"On Google Finance, when comparing price of two stocks over time, they both start at 0% and go up or down from there. Makes sense; at the start, they've both changed 0% since the start. But if you're doing the one-day view you see them start the day a few percent away from 0% and then go up or down. Why?

On the 1D graph, what is the baseline? i.e., what does 0% mean?

Tariffs are here.

News: [Trump Tariffs China, Canada, Mexico](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-03-04/trump-tariffs-china-canada-mexico)

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reports preliminary February China deliveries of 30,688 cars, down close to 50% from last year.

**Technicals:** Overall a brutal delivery report. TSLA has been on a slide since post-election highs and frankly shows no real sign of recovery. Looking for a small bounce in this stock but I don't think there is much potential for long-term recovery.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** TSLA's EV sales have been declining in China mainly due to BYD, which are considered to make better cars for far cheaper outside the US. The US has a 100% EV tariff for non-US made EV vehicles.

**Risks:** BYD has been eating TSLA's lunch outside of the US. I truly don't see TSLA retaining dominance as the EV of choice outside the US. 

**Ticker:** [**OKTA (Okta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OKTA&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Okta beat earnings expectations with EPS of $.78 vs $.74,gave guidance that supports EPS of $3.20 vs $2.93. (Also note that CRWD reports today but are not direct competitors)

**Technicals:** Watching $100 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Cybersecurity (more specifically IAM) grows yearly mainly due to RPO and cRPO (remaining performance obligations). This is subscription backlog expected to be recognized over the next 12 months.

**Risks:** Market saturation/pricing concerns from competitors.

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Nvidia is front and center as the stock most affected by tariff concerns.

**Technicals:** Watching $110 level. Note that this is the lowest it's been since September 2024. We have millions of shares come in in the first 2 minutes of the open so watch for that.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Not much to speak of that hasn't been said before, but NVDA is heavily affected by tariffs and the CHIPS Act, with additional scrutiny that it is somehow bypassing export controls and having their chips go into China.

**Risks:** MORE trade disputes, more potential export restrictions, (Trump has cited he wants to strengthen export controls for NVDA).

**Ticker:** [**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&amp;p=d) / [FXI (iShares China Large-Cap ETF)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&amp;p=d) / Other Chinese Stocks

**Catalyst:** China has imposed 15% retaliatory tariffs on select U.S. goods.

**Technicals:** $130 level. Most interesting level I'm watching today.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Tariffs, stimulus from the Chinese government, China has been spending for increased consumer confidence. 

**Risks:** Even greater tariffs, the cash cannon that China is using dies down, less spending by Chinese consumers, etc.

2025-03-03 14:42:42,r/stocks,Will US-Ukraine Split will trigger Chinese invasion of Taiwan (TSM/NVDA related),"There's at least two possibilities: 

* Our divestment from Ukraine will give us more resources to deal with China militarily; or
* We're actually signaling to China that we are not interested in defending other countries.

Chinese invasion of Taiwan is always on the table, but some people think what happened on Friday at the White House has just raised that possibility dramatically.

For example, Cramer wrote an article over the weekend for his paid community where he said: 

* ""If I was Chinese President Xi Jinping, I would immediately move militarily on Taiwan, betting that President Trump may switch sides and back China.""

* ""If you disagree with that after Friday’s White House exchange with Zelenskyy, you need to soul search your position. To me, this could be a tremendous opportunity for the PRC to stop this whole game of export restrictions from the U.S. and just turn everything on its head by taking over the island and, along with it, the most important strategic asset in the world right now, Taiwan Semi.""

* ""In a world where Zelenskyy gets thrown under the bus for lack of gratitude and starting a war that he didn’t start, how can we defend an allegedly ungrateful Taiwan? Perhaps because, unlike Ukraine, there is something at stake economically?""

* ""Will President Trump’s advisers discuss the notion that if we care about keeping the Chinese from getting the latest and greatest Nvidia chips, we should care about Taiwan’s sovereignty? Will Trump be persuaded by even cowed generals and naïve national security advisers that Nvidia and Taiwan Semi are of strategic importance? Do they even know that?""

Of course Cramer is an entertainer and not a military strategist. But I'm curious what does the community think. Is the American handling of Ukraine increasing or decreasing China's resolve to invade Taiwan soon? Would you change your investment strategy based on your analysis?",155,r2002,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j2ixfl/will_usukraine_split_will_trigger_chinese/,1j2ixfl

Working in software engineering and having studied it, NVDA was massively hyped in engineering circles before the AI hype. I was researching it in 2020 and decided not to pull the trigger since I couldn't completely understand the long term business model. Oh well. 

It sticks out to me the most since I understood the technical MOAT but did not want to take the risk. Hindsight is 20/20.

2025-02-27 16:13:55,r/stocks,Reddit picks winners!,"Year after year Reddit picks the winners! I have kept a close eye on this subreddit for the last 10-15 years and have always been amazed by how ahead of the curve we are. Here is a list of stocks that have been heavily discussed over the years that have performed very well: 

- Tesla 
- Shopify 
- Block
- NVDA 
- AMD 
- PLTR
- AAPL 
- GME

I know everyone in the comments is going to claim this is selection bias, but I can assure you these stocks were talked about so much it is unmistakable. People will also claim but these stocks have tanked since then! They have had significant corrections, but if you bought them when the buzz began you are still significantly in the green.  We will have to wait and see what the future holds. 

 But what about the losers like movie pass!? Of course, some losers have been overly hyped too, but they are far less common. Also, in my opinion, the tone around stocks like movie pass is totally different than a stock like NVDA or SHOP. 

The beautiful part about Reddit is you hear both sides, SHOP had a great deal of resistance back in 2017 and still does. A lot of people claimed it was a worthless company. People like Andrew Left were worshipped for shorting the company. But at the end of the day it was posted about non stop and has performed extremely well. People were also screaming from the top of the mountain that NVDA was overpriced in 2017, look where that ended up. 

Lately it feels like we have entered a new “hype” cycle where a lot of new names have been heavily mentioned. Similar to the hype cycle of 2016-2017 there is a lot of resistance and great discussions behind had. Here are some new names that I have noticed being posted about non stop: 

- RKLB
- IONQ 
- BBAI
- CAVA 
- LUNR
- SMCI
- OKLO 
- BRO

I have been seeing these tickers fly around lately and see a lot of promise in them. They have performed very well in the past 6 months to a year, but we will have to wait and see where they end up in the long term. 

It’s a common meme to short every stock Reddit mentions, but I ultimately disagree. The hive mind is a very powerful and can seemingly predict the future. Keep in mind, the hive mind is what sets the vegas spreads. 

Anyway, that’s my rant for the day. I am sure 75% of you will disagree with me, but again, thats why I love Reddit. Would love to hear your opinions. 

Also, I have holdings in most of the companies listed. This is not financial advice. Do your own due diligence before buying any company I listed. ",0,DoU92,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1izi0k0/reddit_picks_winners/,1izi0k0
2025-02-27 15:37:05,r/stocks,Why is my call option down further when the stock price is up?,"Just looking for some help in understanding this because it doesn't make sense to me at all.

I bought an NVDA call option earlier this week at a $140 strike, expiry 2/28. It's been down and my option was around 2.2, I believe. Then earnings hit and I see during after hours and at market open, NVDA is up yet my option price is down further than the previous day when NVDA was hovering around 129-130.

Not sure what I'm missing here. I'm fairly new to options, as you can tell so any advice would be appreciated.

News: [Nvidia Gives Upbeat Forecast In Sign That AI Build Out Is Strong](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-26/nvidia-gives-upbeat-forecast-in-sign-that-ai-build-out-is-strong)

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings with EPS of $0.89 vs. $0.84 exp and revenue of $39.33B vs. $38.05B exp.

Provided strong guidance, anticipating revenue of $43B vs  $41.78B exp.

Performance is driven by robust demand for Nvidia's Blackwell AI chips, positioning the company to maintain its growth trajectory in the AI sector.

Overall a good earnings report, we're not going to see the stock explode like we did previously with the earnings beats.

**Technicals:** Watching $135 level, other than that I don't anticipate a major selloff due to the earnings news- maybe due to the jobs/macro news instead.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Overall not as explosive as the market wanted it to be. Growth was largely driven by advancements in AI (as usual).

Company said they were still demand constrained, even with export controls.

**Risks:** Potential supply chain disruptions/geopolitical tensions, greater export controls as mentioned previously, and increased competition.

**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM

**Ticker:** [**APP (AppLovin)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=APP&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** A recent short report has been released, alleging that the company's application functions as spyware.

This follows a similar report from approximately a week ago.

**Technicals:** Yesterday I was mainly interested in being long if we broke $300 and had a recovery- I read both of the short reports and they said very similar things, so I thought the selloff was overblown.

Bought a little below $290, still holding. Will likely bail if we break $300 again.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** APP is a mobile tech company that helps devs market/monetize their apps through mobile advertising and marketing platforms, recently announced they were using AI.

**Risks:** The short report allegations are true and they essentially get banned from the Google App/Apple App Store.

**Related Tickers:** SNAP, PINS, TTD

**Ticker:** [**MRNA (Moderna)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MRNA&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** U.S. health officials are reevaluating a $590 million contract awarded to MRNA for bird flu vaccines.

**Technicals:** We saw a decent dip (roughly 5%) in MRNA afterhours yesterday, not too interested in this further unless we see further headlines about the contract being pulled completely.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** MRNA had massive growth during 2020 for being one of the main manufacturers of the COVID vaccine- right now bird flu is being touted as the next potential big pandemic to vaccinate against.

**Risks:** Cancellation is the the real catalyst after this news, or if the contract is awarded to a different company.

**Related Tickers:** PFE, NVAX

**Ticker:** [**SNOW (Snowflake)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNOW&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** SNOW beat expectations, EPS of $0.30 vs. $0.18 exp. and revenue of $986.8M vs. $957.6M exp.

The company also provided an optimistic outlook, projecting current-quarter product revenue between $955M-$960M, driven by increasing demand for AI-related products.

**Technicals:** Interested in $190 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SNOW is a cloud-based data warehousing company and benefits from the demand for AI/ML solutions.

AI is compute intensive which means they can charge more for their services. Also announced integration with Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service.

**Risks:** SNOW doesn't generate GAAP profits still, data breaches, competitors, etc.

The market was down like 25% at the end of 2022, there was fear every single day here. People were screaming about shorting SPY down to 300. The 10 year yield had an inverted curve, which is suppose to almost guarantee a recession. We had negative GDP growth for two quarters but for some reason, it was not listed as a recession. 

Everyone thought 2023 was going to be even worse. Then this nifty little tool called ChatGPT became mainstream and saved the world. I remember people posting “I asked chatGPT X” threads on Reddit at the end of 2022 and everyone being absolutely perplexed. Stocks like $NVDA started blasting off to orbit around spring 2023.

**Catalyst:** Some catalysts today: Deepseek cuts API pricing by 75%, NVDA is reporting earnings, ChatGPT is doing a limited rollout of ChatGPT 4.5, META considering $200B AI data center.

NVDA reporting earnings is the main catalyst today and decides the immediate direction of the market.

**Technicals:** Mainly interested in seeing if NVDA misses revenue (unlikely) or if they say anything significant due to new export controls which I talked about yesterday (strengthening of CHIPS Act export controls to China).

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** NVDA leads in semis design, is a multi-billion dollar company, etc.

**Risks:** I'm currently positioned defensively (sold calls against my position since I have a decent cost basis from back when DeepSeek news released, so overall will just sit on hands and get out of my position if the earnings are bad).

**Related Tickers:** INTC, QCOM, ASML

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** (Old news) New report shows demand is falling in Europe, with sales dropping a precipitous 45% in January.

**Technicals:** Massive selloff since post-election highs- $300 was a significant level I was watching at the time and we exploded past that, so interested to see if we're able to hold above it.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** BYD is a major competitor to TSLA and will likely overtake them in the future, and Musk's political actions are seen as controversial in Europe.

**Risks:** Musk.

**Related Tickers:** BYD, and other auto stocks.

**Ticker:** [**COIN (Coinbase)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&amp;p=d)**/**[**HOOD (Robinhood)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&amp;p=d)**/**[**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&amp;p=d)**/Other CC Stocks**

**Catalyst:** The CC market is experiencing a selloff mainly due to proposed tariffs and the hack at Bybit, resulting in the loss of \~$1.5 billion.

**Technicals:** Not too interested in playing this long- still watching to see how we perform but the sell off has continued, waiting for a larger move still.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Hacks increase fear of storing on centralized exchanges (like Coinbase), proposed tariffs affecting digital assets can lead to market volatility. Interestingly enough, ByBit was (theorized) to be hacked by North Korea.

**Ticker:** [**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&amp;p=d)**/**[**FXI (iShares China Large-Cap ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&amp;p=d)**/Chinese Stocks**

**Catalyst:** China plans to inject at least $55 billion into its largest banks in the coming months as part of a broader stimulus package, Yuan printer go brrrrr. This move is intended to supplement the core Tier 1 capital of China’s six largest state-owned banks. This is the first bank recapitalization since the global financial crisis. 10T yuan (\~$1.4T) debt package to support local government financing and economic stability.

**Technicals:** We've seen a decent upmove on a lot of Chinese stocks due to this, we'll see how the market reacts.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China has been going through a spending crisis, and the government's decision to inject substantial capital into its major banks is a move to strengthen liquidity. This initiative aims to enhance the lending capacity of banks, support local government financing, and stabilize the broader economy. It's a (pre) bailout baby.

**Risks:** This does signal that China sees economic weakness, such as lack of demand due to their real estate sector they've traditionally leaned on for consumer growth/investment. Is this a long term fix? Who knows, but it worked for the US!

**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU

**Ticker: SMCI**

**Catalyst:** They finally filed an hour before the deadline on the final day! Really cutting it close there lol. The company has faced allegations of accounting irregularities. These allegations, along with a failure to file specific financial forms have been a plague for the past year on the stock price. 

**Technicals:** We've seen a 20% move AH, so worth watching at open to see if we move further. Other than that, watching $50/$55 level. We'll see where it goes but worth noting that we've made a significant move back to pre-delisting threat prices already.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Was at threat of delisting from the NASDAQ but now they're safe baby.

**Risks:** People getting out, or the filing being rejected/advised to resubmit. The latter is a massive catalyst but low probability.

News: [Trump Administration Seeks More Restrictions On China Tech Weighs Nvidia Curbs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-25/trump-administration-seeks-more-restrictions-on-china-tech-weighs-nvidia-curbs)

**Ticker:** [**SMH**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMH&amp;p=d)**,** [**NVDA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)**,** [**AMD**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** The Trump administration is planning to strengthen semiconductor export controls to China, aiming to strengthen the CHIPS act from Biden's term.

Additionally, DeepSeek is accelerating the release of its new AI model, R2, following the success of its R1 model. (Most of their training is done on NVDA chips)

**Technicals:** Mainly interested to see if we can hold above $130 for NVDA- note that earnings are tomorrow so the short-term performance of the stock hinges on that. Currently long and sold 155C to hedge my position against it.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** We've seen the CHIPS act actually affect the way that semiconductor companies sell to China- most of those restrictions are bypassed, so this strengthening of export controls might actually affect the industry.

**Risks:** More export controls may lead to China giving tariffs in retaliation- but again, most semis are supply constrained rather than demand constrained so I don't see it as a significant catalyst until more details are released.

**Related Tickers:** [INTC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&amp;p=d), [QCOM](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QCOM&amp;p=d), [ASML](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASML&amp;p=d)

**Ticker:** [**BABA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&amp;p=d)**,** [**FXI (FTSE China 50 Index)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** BABA has introduced its own AI reasoning model within the Qwen framework (like how META has the Llama framework), while we have a surge of all Chinese stock performance following the Chinese government's announcement of liquidity measures.

**Technicals:** It seems as if we've peaked (BABA has gone up close to 50% since the start of this month) for most Chinese stocks in the past few days, I would be interested in being short but I was on vacation this weekend. Interested in shorting BABA specifically if we make another large up move like we did on 2/20.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** BABA is one of the major competitors that is working on AI models, and is notably using NVDA cards to train its models. 

**Risks:** Mainly tariff news and news from other rivals with better models. Straightforward.

**Ticker:** [**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Previously, PLTR faced concerns due to defense budget cuts and CEO Alex Karp reducing his stake in the company. We've seen it make a massive run from retail and fall just as quickly.

**Technicals:** Interested in playing a small bounce- we're up \~10% since last earnings report (and pre-crazy move), there is potential for a small bounce here but only entering a small position since it looks like we bottomed early premarket today. 

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Trump directed the government to make significant cuts to the defense budget. (This is a far more significant catalyst than Alex Karp selling shares)

**Risks:** PLTR lives and dies on defense contract money, so obviously further cuts/expansions will affect stock price.

**Catalyst:** The CC market is experiencing heightened volatility due to proposed tariffs and a significant security breach at Bybit, resulting in the loss of approximately $1.5 billion.

**Technicals:** Not too interested in playing this long- still watching to see how we perform but the sell off resulting in the biggest Coin going to $90K has me watching the stock related proxies that deal with the market. 

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** CC platforms are highly susceptible to regulatory changes and security incidents.

Proposed tariffs affecting digital assets can lead to market vol, while large-scale hacks undermine investor trust and lead to sell-offs in the market as it spreads fear and people wanting to cash out.

**Risks:** Regulatory interventions impose additional compliance costs and operational constraints on CC exchanges.

Security breaches not only result in financial losses but also lead to decreased user adoption and revenue.

2025-02-23 17:54:56,r/stocks,Nvidia Suppliers Send Mixed Signals for Delays on GB200 Systems – What It Means for NVDA Stock,"Recently Analyst Beth Kindig, a bullish analyst, put out an interesting newsletter that was surprisingly bearish on Nvidia due to their supplier commentary. Earnings on Wednesday should be very interesting. Here’s a consolidated copy

Super Micro Lowers FY25 Revenue Guide, Pushes Back 30% Liquid Cooling Target


Super Micro recently reported preliminary fiscal Q2 results, in which it cut its fiscal 2025 revenue guide while hinting that Blackwell GPUs could take longer to ramp in the first part of the calendar year.

At Computex in June 2024, CEO Charles Liang stated that he “expects 15 percent of racks [SMCI] sells this year to use DLC, and 30 percent to employ it [in 2025].” In August 2024,  Liang slightly changed his tune, noting that they now expect “25% to 30% of the new global datacenter deployments to use DLC solutions in the next 12 months.”

I remember this comment well, as it was part of the evidence used to debunk the August rumors considering SMCI had moved up their timeline for DLC delivery (from end of year 2025 to mid-year 2025).

Two weeks ago in the February 2025 report, this timeline was shifted back with Liang stating that Super Micro now believes that “DLC or overall liquid cooling market share will grow all the way to 30% or even more in the next 12 months” -- it’s not a dramatic shift in tone but rather pushes the 30% target back from mid-year 2025 noted in August, to beyond the original year-end timeline --- to now technically being early 2026.

The August earnings call also housed one critical piece of information regarding Blackwell and Super Micro’s 2025 revenue. Wells Fargo’s Aaron Rakers questioned management about Blackwell and guidance for December 2024 and onwards. Liang explained that for the December quarter, Blackwell “will be very small. Engineering sample small volume. So the real volume, I believe, had to be March quarter next year. And that's why we foresee only $26 billion to $30 billion.”

But now, SMCI implied they are not able to ship Blackwell in the March quarter:

Super Micro has walked back the revenue guide that hinged on Blackwell’s NVL systems shipping in volume in the March quarter. Management was also quite clear that the new product was facing a delay as they await more GPU supply.

Vertiv Signals Softer Q1


Vertiv is a provider of thermal and power management solutions and is a leader in direct liquid cooling. The company stated they benefited from a “particularly strong” Q4, with revenue rising nearly 26% YoY as they overdelivered by nearly $200 million as customers wanted products as soon as possible.

Vertiv’s strength in Q4 may be tied to key partner Dell, as its AI server backlog in fiscal Q3 (October quarter) rose more than 18% QoQ to $4.5 billion after being flat QoQ in Q2, and its AI pipeline rising more than 50% QoQ. Analysts placed Dell’s AI server pipeline at $16 to $17 billion, up from $11 to $13 billion previously, a rather large jump for one quarter. However, Dell noted that one factor for its softer Q4 and fiscal year guide was the “unpredictability of the AI shipments” as there are “some more timing differences than what we were anticipating when we gave the guide the last quarter.”

For Q1, Vertiv guided a deceleration to 19% YoY growth, with FY25 revenue growth guided at 16%. Management defended this deceleration into Q1 by saying: “Now of course, Q4 was particularly strong. So we should not look at Q1 as a quarter-to-quarter, really look at the first quarter sales as the acceleration that has taken place. With a 19% organic growth in the first quarter, I feel very, very good about what that tells us about our overall trajectory” and also that it is “higher than what we actually saw in 2024.”

Liquid cooling capacity is not a constraint for Vertiv, as they had said last summer that they were “on track to finish in 2024 with a 45x capacity increase compared to baseline at the end of 2023.”

I agree with the analyst sentiment (and weak price action) following the report that the commentary doesn’t check out exactly. management is contradicting itself by guiding for organic growth of 19% at the midpoint for Q1 but 16% growth for the fiscal year (i.e., slower growth later in the year) while stating shipments will increase QoQ.

Additionally, the QoQ/YoY has to be looked at which is lower than what typical seasonality would account for, as our numbers indicate Vertiv was down (12.1%) due to seasonal sequential growth from Q4-Q1. This year, Vertiv is down (16.9%) from Q4-Q1.

My conclusion (still to be confirmed) is that Vertiv may see a weak Q2 before there is an acceleration into the back half.


Networking Companies Shift Tone on Timing for GB200s


PCIe 6.0 supplier:

PCIe 6.0 is a networking standard expected to initially ship with Nvidia’s Blackwell. A key supplier stated to expect this in the second half of the year, as these products “are driving higher dollar content opportunities [...] on a full rack and full accelerator basis and we expect volume deployments to begin in the second half of this year.”

Revealed at GTC in March of 2024, PCIe 6.0 was initially expected to launch with the GB200s. The following quote from this supplier also hints that merchant GPUs (Nvidia) will not be driving H1 – which would be odd if Blackwell was shipping. “Now, if you look into 2025, we see both contributing growth. The first half of the year will be more predominantly the internal AI accelerator programs. But if you get into the back half of the year, the transition on the merchant GPUs will also be very strong for us. This is where you'll see the custom rack configurations start to deploy and that’s where we see a big dollar increase in our contemporary GPU with [our product] starting to ramp.”

PMIC Suppliers:

PMICs (power management integrated circuits) are a critical part of the picture for Blackwell, given that these components were linked to Blackwell’s rumored power management issues. Major PMIC suppliers were unable to confirm volume shipments in the first quarter in recent earnings calls.

One PMIC supplier that we covered on our Advanced site on Feb 5th, is stating that “We know that we're not the only one players going after this, so the share is still to be determined. The final design, everything is still to be finalized as well, too. So we're working closely with the customer. Again, at this point, we can say that we're targeting for a mid-year launch.”

This company is either discussing Blackwell Ultra with the B300s, or they are implying GB200s are delayed.

The competing PMIC supplier stated: “Just to add a little bit of color to how we see the year rolling out, we believe that we will be off to a slower start in the first half of the year. But as the year develops, the customer base is expected to broaden as hyperscalers launch their new products. We have multiple product ramps with both existing customers as well as with these new hyperscalers.”

The takeaway is that neither PMIC supplier can confirm they are shipping in volume in Q1 or Q2, yet meanwhile, both are saying they are still part of the supply chain.

Semtech Suddenly Pulls Guidance on Active Copper Cabling (ACCs)


Perhaps the most drastic commentary to come out of the last few weeks was when a key supplier pulled its Q1 guidance intra-quarter.

Semtech filed an 8-K stating that “net sales from its CopperEdge products used in active copper cables are expected to be lower than the Company’s previously disclosed floor case estimate of $50 million due to rack architecture changes, with no expected ramp-up over the course of fiscal year 2026.”

ACC content had been estimated to be substantially higher with 36x2 configurations – it had been rumored back in October 2024 that Nvidia was halting development of one of the NVL72 configurations, the NVL36x2, which linked two 36 GPU racks together in a side-by-side system. Semtech pulling guidance strengthens this view.

The shift in architecture to discontinue the 36x2 configuration was said to possibly “disrupt the supply chain for assembly and cooling solutions,” by removing dual-rack configurations and focusing solely on single-rack NVL72 and NVL36 configurations. DLC suppliers have been pushing back Blackwell’s ramp later in the year, suggesting that the market may have faced some impacts from this rumored design change late last year.

While shifting architectures is not a big deal in the medium-term (as stated above, NVL72 single rack configurations are expected to see a higher mix); it’s the suddenness that Semtech pulled it’s guidance that is cause for concern as the company had reaffirmed its optimistic revenue floor guidance  based on two factors – the timing of Blackwell’s launch and changes in rack design. This suggests both factors may be in play, as a late-stage design change was expected to have downstream impacts on timing for DLC ramping.

Conclusion:
Given market jitters around DeepSeek, which turned out to be a non-issue, something more material related to the GB200s, such as growth slowing below expectations at the start of the new fiscal year, could send the stock below $100 -- which we would see as a buying opportunity.

There is a scenario where Nvidia’s stock marches higher – perhaps based on the remaining strength from Hopper and the B200s, B200 HGX systems and B200As packaged with CoWoS-S and having a lower thermal design power (TDP). Or perhaps the string of suppliers discussed here are simply stating the GB200s are not ramping in volume in Q1 but will in Q2.",126,thelastsubject123,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iweku5/nvidia_suppliers_send_mixed_signals_for_delays_on/,1iweku5

Palantir has been on a tear recently, all hyped up on the defense sector growth but no one is really paying attention to Meta Defense and their entry to the space. Last year Meta opened up its AI models to defense agencies and contractors. This is huge for them to get this level of clearance and i think this will will put them in direct competition with Palantir. Im not sure how they build out this branch of Meta, Im calling it Meta Defense but they fired all their woke people and are starting to re-shape the company.

Yes, there is defense spending cuts but its all on waste and overcharged contracts not on things that actually matter for the dept of defense. During the inauguration Zuckerberg was in the front row, Hegseth was somewhere in the back. Just an observation.

Everyone is familiar with their social media business so there isnt a whole lot to talk about there. AI keeps improving, More growth from Reels, Threads, Facebook. Their LLM is impressive and arguably one of the best, putting them up there with OpenAI.

With all there user data they have Meta Analytics could be another source of revenue.

They are sitting on a goldmine with Facebook market place. i get they have ads but i feel they could do more.  Im not sure Zuckerberg realized what he has there but this business if monetized right could be HUGE.

I think the stock goes to $800 and splits 2 or 3 for 1 and continues to climb higher and raising its dividend.",0,Euro347,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iu6l14/meta_quick_analysis/,1iu6l14

Most interesting news today is the hope that the meeting between Russian/US officials may end the three-year war in Ukraine, in addition to release of the Grok-3 model from xAI (Elon Musk's AI startup.)

News: [Musk S Xai Debuts Grok 3 Ai Bot Touting Benchmark Superiority](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-18/musk-s-xai-debuts-grok-3-ai-bot-touting-benchmark-superiority)

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)/[**SMH**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMH&amp;p=d)/every semis and AI facing stock

**Catalyst:** Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, has unveiled its latest model, Grok-3, claiming it surpasses competitors like GPT-4o, Google Gemini, DeepSeek V3, and Claude.

These assertions have not been independently verified by the open sourcen community but it wouldn't be surprising if it could surpass 4o (the model is close to a year old now)

**Technicals:** No real level I've been watching in NVDA, SMH, already positioned long. Note that xAI uses NVDA GPU's specifically in their super computer.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** We've seen a very strong recovery since the Deepseek fears caused a selloff. Personally I don't think xAI will cause the same effect that Deepseek did, but I think that the semis are a winner of this again.

**Risks:** Unverified performance claims may lead to skepticism among investors and potential customers, impacting adoption rates and market trust. XAI has a “Colossus supercomputer,” for training AI, which it said last year was utilizing a cluster of 100,000 advanced Nvidia GPUs for AI training.

Today, the company revealed that it doubled the size of its GPU cluster for the training of Grok 3.

**Related Tickers:** ARM, AMD, INTC

**Offhand Comments:** May see reversal of news if performance doesn't match claims.

**Ticker:** [**HEES (Herc Holdings Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HEES&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** HEES has confirmed a $105 per share acquisition offer from Herc Rentals, surpassing the previous $92 per share bid from United Rentals.

**Technicals:** Watching $100 level. They've accepted the bid so we might see trading closer to that bid price in the near future.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Equipment rental industry is witnessing consolidation due to decelerating growth since 2023 (other than that nothing explosive)

**Risks:** The bidding war may escalate acquisition costs, potentially leading to overvaluation and financial strain for the acquiring company.

**Related Tickers:** URI, HRI

**Ticker:** [**NKE (Nike Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Nike has announced a new brand collaboration with SKIMS, launching a line called NikeSKIMS.

**Technicals:** Watching $75 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SKIMS is pretty popular- mainly does underwear/loungewear/shapewear but this might be more focused on athleisure. This could potentially make a difference in NKE sales- SKIMS also collaborated with The North Face in the past, so worth keeping track of this for future catalysts in case they work with other brands.

**Catalyst:** Unconfirmed reports suggest that President Trump plans to demand $500 billion from Ukraine and seek U.S. control over the country's mineral resources.

These claims have not been reported by major U.S. news outlets but have appeared in international media (from India, Canada, UK)

**Technicals:** This catalyst has been ""semi-leaked"" for the past week but not ""fully confirmed"", but we would likely see a selloff in defense stocks if true.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** These companies would go to the downside from an end to the Ukraine war, and spike if talks aren't successful.

**Risks:** Pretty much a ""wait for the news announcement"" kind of trade, pretty straightforward.

The company noted a 178% quarter-over-quarter increase in external API calls for its ERNIE AI bot and expects its AI investments to deliver more significant results in 2025.

Additionally, Apollo Go has commenced 100% fully driverless operations across China since February.

  
**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The technology sector is rapidly advancing in AI and autonomous driving technologies. Something interesting over the weekend was Xi meeting with private sector business leaders, signaling that China would be more friendly to business leaders (like Jack Ma)
