Second-quarter adjusted earnings landed at 68 cents per share, six cents shy of Wall Street estimates, weighed down by higher insurance claims, legal costs, and restructuring charges. The stock slipped as much as 4.4% in early New York tradingits sharpest drop since Maybefore stabilizing. Analysts described the earnings shortfall as more of a temporary setback than a shift in the long-term story, suggesting these cost pressures could moderate in the months ahead.

2025-08-21 14:31:29,r/stocks,Walmart hikes sales and earnings outlook even as it says tariff costs are rising,"Walmart on Thursday raised its full-year earnings and sales outlook as its online business posted another quarter of double-digit gains, even as the company said costs are rising from higher tariffs. 

The big-box retailer topped Wall Street’s quarterly sales estimates but fell short of earnings expectations, the first time it missed on quarterly earnings since May 2022. The company said it felt pressure on profits for the period, including from some one-time expenses, such as restructuring costs, pricier insurance claims and litigation settlements.

Walmart said it now expects net sales to grow between 3.75% to 4.75% for the fiscal year, up from its previous expectations for 3% to 4%. It raised its adjusted earnings per share outlook slightly to $2.52 to $2.62, up from a prior range of $2.50 to $2.60 per share.

In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said the company is working hard to keep prices low – including speeding up imports from overseas and stepping up the number of Rollbacks, or limited-time discounts, in its stores. 

“This is managed on an item-by-item and category-by-category basis,” he said. “There are certainly areas where we have fully absorbed the impact of higher tariff costs. There are other areas where we’ve had to pass some of those costs along.”

But he added “tariff-impacted costs are continuing to drift upwards.” 

Even so, Rainey said Walmart hasn’t seen a change in customer spending. For example, sales of private label items, which typically cost less than national brands, were roughly flat year over year, he said.

“Everyone is looking to see if there are any creaks in the armor or anything that’s happening with the consumer, but it’s been very consistent,” he said. “They continue to be very resilient.”

Yet on the company’s earnings call, CEO Doug McMillon said middle- and lower-income households have been more sensitive to tariff-related price increases, particularly in discretionary categories.

“We see a corresponding moderation in units at the item level as customers switch to other items, or in some cases, categories,” he said.

Here’s what the big-box reported for the fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 68 cents adjusted vs. 74 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $177.40 billion vs. $176.16 billion

Walmart shares fell nearly 4% in premarket trading Thursday.

Walmart’s net income jumped to $7.03 billion, or 88 cents per share, in the three-month period that ended July 31, compared with $4.50 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. 

Revenue rose from $169.34 billion in the year-ago quarter. 

Comparable sales for Walmart U.S. climbed 4.6% in the second quarter, excluding fuel, compared with the year-ago period, as both the grocery and health and wellness category saw strong growth. That was higher than the 4% increase that analysts expected. The industry metric**,** also called same-store sales, includes sales from stores and clubs open for at least a year.

At Sam’s Club, comparable sales jumped 5.9% excluding fuel, higher than the 5.2% that analysts anticipated.

Retailers recorded online sales growth of 30.3% during events that included Amazon Prime Day, Adobe said on Saturday, compared with [its projections of ](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-prime-day-set-lift-us-online-sales-238-billion-adobe-estimates-2025-07-07/)28.4%.

Several major retailers including e-commerce giant [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) [(AMZN.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/AMZN.O), Walmart [(WMT.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/WMT.N), Target [(TGT.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TGT.N) as well as Best Buy [(BBY.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/BBY.N) have been launching deal events with strong discounts, encouraging shoppers to trade up on expensive items they might normally pass on.

[Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) extended its sales window to 96 hours, up from the typical 48, featuring aggressive promotions on categories ranging from apparel to electronics.

A wave of enticing deals comes at a time when heightened trade tensions amid the Trump administration's volatile tariff policies have rattled consumers and businesses, and as the new August 1 deadline for countries to renegotiate trade agreements with the United States looms.

According to the report, shopping on mobile was the dominant transaction channel during the Prime Day event, driving 53.2% of online sales, above Adobe's forecast of 52.5%.

According to Adobe, overall discounts across U.S. retailers were between 11% and 24%, compared with the prior forecast range of 10% to 24%.Apparel had the biggest deals at 24%, compared with 20% last year, while electronics were at 23%, similar to last year.

2025-05-19 05:33:37,r/stocks,3 year 30k investment strategy - feedback please,"I would love some feed back on the following strategy I plan to execute as a side project for myself. I have put together 30k for this. This is not my safe money or retirement money but it’s also not Monopoly money. I am ok with high volatility as I execute this strategy. This is really to see if the strategy is good, understand the time commitment needed and also confirm to myself  that I can manage a good execution and not get impulsive. 

Success criteria: If done properly, I want to be able to convert this 30k to 50k over 3 years which is assuming a 20% YoY return. My current managed portfolio gets me 11-12% YoY last 7 years so if only I can get close to 20% it makes sense to me to use my own time to do it. I have a full time job so I expect to track the market news and stocks every other hour or so but not be constantly involved. 

The distribution or strategy I have thought is:

1. 40% (12k) in relatively stable stocks that I expect will beat the SPY so I am thinking Meta 5k Goog 5k Amazon 2k

2. 30% (9k) relatively aggressive so I am thinking on two lines:

2a: invest in stocks with associated risk but also good reward over 3 years like UNH, AMD, AVGO

2b: invest in options of tickers with lesser risks but continued stable growth for aggressive return like BABA, WMT, TSMC

3. 30% (9k) for buy the dip or DCA into above strategy. 

I would love your feedback on:

A. Over strategy and percentage distribution. 

B. Tickers I have in mind vs others 

C. Anything I have missed in general. Is this sustainable along with a job and family. 

Thanks again and appreciate your feedback. I expect to make these purchases over the next 2 weeks and do a few house cleaning things:

1. Track overall and stock level daily move of anything more than 2% to make adjustment
2. Monthly tracking of anything that moved 5% 
3. Follow broader markets news and adjust cash reserves accordingly. A little lower if outlook looks good and hold at 30% if it’s same. Don’t want to go more than 30% at any point. The idea is to play safe but not to play very very safe. 
4. Limit hopium and fomo, don’t expect magic before or after buying.

2025-05-15 13:55:49,r/stocks,"Walmart CFO says price hikes from tariffs could start later this month, as retailer beats on earnings","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/15/walmart-wmt-q1-2026-earnings.html


&gt; Walmart on Thursday fell just short of quarterly sales estimates, as even the world’s largest retailer said it would feel the pinch of higher tariffs.  Even so, the Arkansas-based discounter stuck by its full-year forecast, which calls for sales to grow 3% to 4% and adjusted earnings of $2.50 to $2.60 per share for the fiscal year. That cautious profit outlook had disappointed Wall Street in February. Walmart also marked a milestone: It posted its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business both in the U.S. and globally. The business has benefitted from the growth of higher-margin moneymakers, including online advertising and Walmart’s third-party marketplace.  In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said tariffs are “still too high” – even with the recently announced agreement to lower duties on imports from China to 30% for 90 days. 

&gt; “We’re wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb,” he said. “It’s more than any supplier can absorb. And so I’m concerned that consumer is going to start seeing higher prices. You’ll begin to see that, likely towards the tail end of this month, and then certainly much more in June.” Walmart said it expects net sales to increase 3.5% to 4.5% for the fiscal second quarter, but declined to provide guidance for earning per share or operating income growth because of fluctuating U.S. tariff policy.

&gt; Here is what the big-box retailer reported for the three-month period that ended May 2 compared with Wall Street’s estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:

- Earnings per share: 61 cents, adjusted vs. 58 cents expected

- Revenue: $165.61 billion vs. $165.84 billion expected

&gt; In the fiscal first quarter, Walmart’s net income fell to $4.49 billion, or 56 cents per share, compared with $5.10 billion, or 63 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose about 2.5% from $161.51 billion in the year-ago period, but had a 1% headwind from lapping Leap Day in the year-ago period. Yet it marked Walmart’s first quarterly revenue miss since February 2020. Comparable sales – an industry metric also known as same-store sales – jumped 4.5% for Walmart U.S. and 6.7% for Sam’s Club, excluding fuel. E-commerce sales increased 21% in the U.S., marking the 12th straight quarter of double-digit gains. Global e-commerce sales jumped 22% year over year.

&gt; Walmart is often seen as a barometer for the health of the U.S. consumer because of its thousands of stores and large customer base that cuts across age, income and region. Rainey told CNBC that Walmart has not seen a noticeable shift in consumer behavior from previous quarters. “They’re discerning. They’re mindful. They’re maybe a little concerned about possible looming price increases, but their behaviors largely have not changed. They’re still looking for value,” he said. Still, he said, Walmart plans to “play offense” by keeping its price gaps below competitors. He said the company will absorb some of the higher prices from tariffs and expects suppliers will, too.

&gt; Unlike some of its peers, Walmart has advantages that have helped it better weather an uncertain economy and woo a more selective U.S. consumer. As the nation’s largest grocer, it sells food and necessities that drive steadier store and website traffic. And as a well-known value player, it can use lower prices to attract even middle- and upper-income customers who want to pay less. Already, Walmart has attracted wealthier shoppers with faster deliveries, store remodels and a wider assortment of brands.",297,23,WickedSensitiveCrew,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kn6as3/walmart_cfo_says_price_hikes_from_tariffs_could/,1kn6as3

News: [US Stock Futures Rise As Dip Buyers Emerge After Selloff](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-08/us-stock-futures-rise-as-dip-buyers-emerge-after-selloff)

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&amp;p=d)\-China retaliates with an 84% tariff on US goods. The tariff escalation adds further pressure- Apple has flown literal planeloads of iPhones out of China but that's obviously a stop-gap measure. We've seen AAPL fall to $169, massively beyond what I could have even hoped. Still flat this but probably the #1 play if expecting a tariff reversal- the White House and Trump have signaled that tariffs are here to stay. Currently long a little from $170, but will bail if we hit those prices premarket/at the open.

They did cite net sales growing 3-4% this year. WMT backing away from guidance signals the ""we are in danger"" alarm over tariff impact on import costs and consumer demand even with net sales growing. TGT, with similar exposure, is likely to experience margin pressure in coming quarters. Margins are squeezed massively (and retailers are likely to take a loss on some goods simply because it's untenable to continue selling for a loss). 

[**DAL (Delta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DAL&amp;p=d)\- CEO states Trump tariffs are hurting bookings, and was unable to reaffirm guidance. Forecasted Q2 EPS of $1.70–$2.30 vs. $2.23 est. Revenue to range -2% - +2% YoY vs. +1.9% est. Tariff fears hitting forward travel demand are a red flag, especially international bookings. Airlines face multiple macro pressures—tariffs, softening travel sentiment, currency exchange fluctuations, etc, overall a different set of circumstances from COVID yet as deadly. 

[**TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TLT&amp;p=d)\-Massive afterhours move as China sells U.S. Treasuries, resulting in a 5 point move afterhours. Bloomberg is also citing an unwind of popular hedge fund trade. The scale and consistency of the move suggest a structural shift, not just positioning. Treasury market dislocation is raising systemic risk signals across asset classes. I think we've hit roughly \~5% for the 20 year which is a big deal- China dumping treasuries means that yields go up but exacerbate inflation in the short term, and add to volatility.

[**HUM (Humana)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HUM&amp;p=d), [**CVS (CVS Health)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CVS&amp;p=d), [**UNH (UnitedHealth Group)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&amp;p=d)\-Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced higher-than-expected Medicare Advantage payment rate increases for 2026.

AXP - we are back to sept 2024 pricing.  I had serious FOMO when it hit $327 in January.  one of Warren's favorite stocks.  Im buying at $250 today.  glad I waited.

AMZN - also back to sept pricing.  they are 2nd to WMT but offer so much more.   Their growth seems certain.  I'll buy at $180 today.

honorable mention - AVGO but Im not buying at $160.  I need $140 or less.

2025-03-25 15:31:21,r/stocks,How safe do you think WMT (Walmart) is as an investment long term? Is retail dying? Specifically the types of products Walmart sells,"I haven't done too deep research into retail, but I just know anecdotal that retail for myself and people I know is significantly diminishing. Amazon and other online retailers are the go to, and even when you go into a store you are likely comparing prices to online anyways and choosing which is cheaper, which usually is online.

  
That combined with Walmart carrying mainly cheap chinese products doesnt seem like they have great retention of buyers and diminishing revenue when those cheap chinese products are EVERYWHERE.

  
The thing that saves Walmart is definitely groceries and other daily services are products they carry which are convenient and well priced.

  
I obviously dont see Walmart going out of business or struggling any time soon in the short term, but I am thinking 10-20+ years from now will it still be the same powerhouse company?

  
Can you guys give some insight on their fundamentals and what your outlook is on Walmart in like 10+ years? It seems like their P/E ratio is pretty solid, I just cant help but think they will turn into a bed bath and beyond eventually. Maybe that will come well after I'm dead.",88,58,Interr0gate,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jjkqb3/how_safe_do_you_think_wmt_walmart_is_as_an/,1jjkqb3
2025-03-19 06:55:08,r/stocks,Trump’s Trade War 2.0: The Stocks I’m Watching,"With Trump back in office and tariffs returning in full force, I’ve been analyzing what this means for U.S. equities. His latest moves—25% steel and aluminum tariffs, expanded levies on Chinese imports, and a tariff-heavy negotiation strategy—echo his first term but with even **stronger measures**.



While 2018-2020 gave us some clues, the market setup in 2025 is **different**:

• **Higher inflation &amp; rates:** Tariffs add inflationary pressure, making the Fed’s job harder.

• **China’s response will change:** Unlike in 2018, China now **dominates EV battery production** and **controls rare earth supply chains**—this could hurt U.S. tech more than before.

• **Supply chain resilience is mixed:** Companies have talked about reshoring for years, but it’s still expensive and slow.

Given these factors, here’s how I’m positioning:

**Likely Winners:**

1. **Steel &amp; Aluminum (NUE, STLD, CLF)** – Tariffs give them pricing power, though cost inflation is a risk.

2. **Defense &amp; Cybersecurity (LMT, PLTR, CRWD)** – “America First” likely means **higher defense budgets**.

3. **Regional Banks (JPM, BAC, GS)** – If deregulation follows, these should gain.

4. **Domestic Infrastructure (CAT, DE, OSK)** – If tariffs hurt foreign suppliers, U.S. construction demand rises.



**Likely Losers:**

1. **Tech Giants (AAPL, NVDA, QCOM, INTC)** – Heavy China exposure = supply chain and revenue risks.

2. **Consumer Goods (NKE, WMT, DG)** – Imports get pricier, and passing costs to lower-income customers is tough.

3. **Auto &amp; Industrial (TSLA, GM, F, MMM)** – Higher input costs + China retaliation = pain.

4. **Agri Exporters (ADM, TSN, BG)** – If China targets U.S. farm products again, these get hit.



**What I’m watching:**

📌 Will China retaliate with rare earth metal export bans? (Impacts TSLA, NVDA, QCOM)

📌 Do inflation expectations rise, pushing Fed policy hawkish? (Bad for rate-sensitive stocks)

📌 Does Trump backtrack on any tariffs? (A la 2019)

📌 Will domestic manufacturing gains **outweigh** supply chain disruptions?

I’d love to hear counterpoints. Which stocks do you think will **outperform or underperform** in Trump’s Trade War 2.0?",482,231,notllmchatbot,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jeqaup/trumps_trade_war_20_the_stocks_im_watching/,1jeqaup

# [Dow futures drop 100 points as Walmart shares slide after earnings: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/19/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures moved lower Thursday, a day after the S&amp;P 500 hit a fresh all-time high, while retail giant Walmart slid after issuing a disappointing outlook.
*****
&gt; Futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 110 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures shed 0.2% each.
*****
&gt; Dow member Walmart dropped more than 7% after the company said it expects fiscal year sales to grow between 3% and 4%. The company’s fiscal 2026 earnings outlook, meanwhile, was also below analyst expectations. The weak guidance overshadowed fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that topped estimates.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a winning session, with the S&amp;P 500 on Wednesday posting another record high. The Nasdaq Composite and the 30-stock Dow also finished in positive territory as investors shrugged off President Donald Trump’s warning of more tariffs.
*****
&gt; “We have been using the word ‘resilient,’” Elyse Ausenbaugh, head of investment strategy at JPMorgan Wealth Management said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Wednesday. She added that she expects another high single-digit total return upside from here.
*****
&gt; “We think that 2025 is going to be a year that investors have a chance to build on strength,” Ausenbaugh continued. “We see more room for this market rally to run.”
*****
&gt; Investors also digested newly released minutes from the Federal Reserve’s January meeting. The minutes showed that the central bank’s officials last month agreed that inflation needs to come down more before they cut interest rates again.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere on the economic front, investors will be watching for weekly jobless claims data, which is due at 8:30 a.m. ET.

2025-02-11 16:24:31,r/stocks,Looking to balance a mostly FAANG portfolio,"Historically I've stayed mostly in S&amp;P 500 index funds, but I'd like to be a bit more aggressive and shift into a FAANG-heavy portfolio. I'm hoping to balance it by adding large cap, non-tech stocks like $COST. What are some other large-cap stocks that offer high-growth opportunity but aren't heavily reliant on technology/AI?

EDIT: A few interesting options I've found with strong performance over the past 5-10 years, in no particular order...

LLY, TPL, WM, GEV, AMX, BKNG, BRK-B, LMT, LRCX, NTAP, STLD, TRV, UNH, VRTX

I currently have a TSP as for retirement purposes and thought about using the stock market as an investment to put money to the side, watch it grow (or disappear), and use it for purposes like buying a new car, upgrades on my classic car, down payment for a house, or use it for things like traveling, etc.

Is this a wise thing to do? I plan on holding for 2-5 years, maybe even more. I want to throw in at least $300 every other week and have a fairly diverse portfolio.

2024-12-25 06:31:07,r/stocks,Expensive Stocks vs Cheaper Stocks in Roth IRA,"Sorry in advance is this isn't allowed. Just trying to educate myself a bit more and this seemed like the best sub to ask this

Can someone give me advice on if it's better or worse to buy high priced stocks such as GOOG, APPL, JPM, COST, etc which are very high cost stocks vs cheaper stocks like WMT, CSCO etc. For context I am putting over 50% into SWPPX and SWLGX, I also have a pension and max out my Roth TSP, so I'm looking at my Roth IRA as more a place to be able to perhaps take more risk in it. I'm 41 and only just started my Roth IRA.

So my thinking is for example is it better to buy 2 shares of stock A at $200 per share or 8 shares of stock B at $50 per share, or no difference? I'm smart financially but not the best at stocks and in my brain it seems like stocks inherently have a ceiling and so lower stock of a strong company is better than higher stock of also a strong company.

2024-12-17 04:41:04,r/stocks,why are my WMT outperforming my MSFT shares,"I went into my brokerage app today and saw, much to my surprise, that my WMT shares are actually outperforming my MSFT shares by about 0.6% (small IK but it got me thinking). I bought them around the same time, across 2020-2024 (mostly in 2020 for both). 

Looking at the stocks outside of the context of when I bought them, MSFT is outperforming 103% vs 97% but this still begs the question of why is MSFT only outperforming by that little when MSFT is 🚀 and WMT is 💩right? 

So I dug into the numbers a bit (super simple stuff)

\*\*\*Don't know why my pictures can't be added to the post but here's an Imgur link [https://imgur.com/a/4PbHxI7](https://imgur.com/a/4PbHxI7) 

Top Line Growth

MSFT: 49%

WMT: 16%



Bottom Line Growth

MSFT: 63%

WMT: 12%



Dividend Growth

MSFT: 33%

WMT: 5.5%

  
PE

MSFT: 37

WMT:  39 (wtf)

  
Conclusion: WMT price growth seems crazy. Either they're overvalued or MSFT is undervalued. I'm thinking WMT is overvalued and I should sell some. 

 What's everyone else's thoughts?

Positions:

WMT: 6 shares (+IDK in ETFs because I'm only seeing top 25 parsed results)

MSFT: 5 shares (+20k in ETFs)

2024-10-22 20:26:37,r/stocks,Thoughts on Walmart?,"I'm considering picking up some shares but thought I'd see what the sub thinks.

Walmart's up 56% YTD which seems pretty astonishing for any retailer, let alone the largest company by revenue in the world.

Speaking of that revenue, it's grown from $524B in 2020 to $648B currently. P/E is 42 and EPS growth forecast according to Schwab for the 3-5 year horizon is 10.17%, which is higher than Costco and Target. 

Now they're moving into pharmaceutical delivery in an attempt to box out Walgreen's and CVS. It's a troublesome area, and WMT didn't fair well opening affordable health clinics, but does signal intent to continue growing revenue at a fast clip. 

Anecdotally, WMT seems like a great business. Their online and in-store shopping process has always been great IMO. I fondly remember my days in college going to the all night supercenter to find badly needed ping pong balls on a Saturday evening.

2024-10-01 21:15:40,r/stocks,Challenge to find stocks matching 13 attributes of Peter Lynch,"I tried to find modern examples to each attribute mentioned in Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street. Then I thought this community could find better fits and have fun together. So please share you candidates for any category below - maybe we discover hidden gems along the way.

RECAP: Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street is  filled with fundamental yet profound strategies.  Invest in simple, easy-to-understand businesses over complex ones.  Identify undervalued companies with stable returns and less competition. And, search for as many of 13 attributes of the hypothetically ""perfect company."" The dream attributes of such a company go as:

***It Sounds Dull—Or Even Better Ridiculous:***

Companies with unexciting or absurd names often go unnoticed and can be undervalued, providing excellent buying opportunities. Lynch highlights that these companies are typically engaged in simple, straightforward businesses and the duller the name, the better the prospects could be.

My examples: Duckhorn Portfolio (NAPA) &amp; The Lovesac Company (LOVE)

***It Does Something Dull:***

Companies engaged in mundane or straightforward businesses might not attract attention but often provide stable and increasing returns. Lynch appreciates companies that do boring things as they are less likely to be in the limelight and more likely to be undervalued.

My examples: Waste Management (WM) &amp; Stepan Company (SCL)

***It Does Something Disagreeable:***

Businesses involved in unpleasant industries (like waste management) are often overlooked. Their disagreeable nature keeps them under the radar of most investors, potentially leading to lower valuations and higher returns for those willing to invest in them.

My Examples: Altria Group (MO), cannabis companies and Caesars Entertainment (CZR)

***It’s a Spinoff:***

Corporate spinoffs often result in profitable investment opportunities. Parent companies usually ensure that spinoffs have strong balance sheets and are well-positioned for success, leading to lucrative investments.

Found a good website on this: [https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/](https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/)

***The Institutions Don’t Own It, and The Analysts Don’t Follow It:***

Stocks with little to no institutional ownership and minimal analyst coverage can indicate untapped potential. These ""ignored"" stocks might offer significant opportunities for gains before they become mainstream.

My examples: Denny's Corporation (DENN) &amp; Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR)

***The Rumors Abound: It’s Involved with Toxic Waste and/or the Mafia:***

Lynch points out that companies involved in industries surrounded by rumors or negative perceptions, like waste management or alleged Mafia connections, can offer hidden value. The negative stigma leads to fewer investors and potentially lower valuations.

My examples: **Clean Harbors (CLH)** &amp; Boyd Gaming (BYD)

***There’s Something Depressing About It:***

Companies operating in industries that deal with the less pleasant aspects of life, like funeral services, often have consistent demand and face little competition. They are typically ignored by the larger investing community, providing opportunities for higher returns.

My examples: Service Corporation International (SCI) &amp; Matthews International Corporation (MATW)

***It’s a No-Growth Industry:***

Contrary to popular belief, Lynch prefers investing in low or no-growth industries as they tend to have less competition and more predictable business. The stability and predictability of such industries can lead to steady returns.

My examples: Consolidated Edison (ED) &amp; American Water Works (AWK)

***It’s Got a Niche:***

A strong niche market provides a company with a competitive edge and often a virtual monopoly in its area. Niche companies can control pricing and enjoy high barriers to entry for competitors, often leading to sustained profits

My examples: Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) &amp; WD-40 Company (WDFC)

***People Have to Keep Buying It:***

Lynch prefers investing in companies that make essential, habitual or addictive products like drugs, soft drinks, or cigarettes over those making fickle products, as continuous buying ensures steady business.

My examples: Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) &amp; Reckitt Benckiser (RBGLY)

***It's a User of Technology:***

Companies that effectively utilize technology to reduce costs or enhance services are appealing. For example, a company benefiting from the technological price war, like Automatic Data Processing using cheaper computers to increase its profitability, is a better bet than the companies making the computers.

My examples: Walmart (WMT) &amp; Domino’s Pizza (DPZ)

***The Insiders are Buyers:***

Insider buying is a strong positive signal. If the people who know the company best are buying its stock, it's a good indication of confidence in the company's future. Lynch values insider buying as a sign that the company won't go bankrupt soon and that management is aligned with shareholders' interests.

My examples: Zoom Video Communications (ZM) &amp; Carnival Corporation (CCL)

***The Company is Buying Back Shares:***

Companies that buy back their own shares reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases the value of the remaining shares. This action typically indicates the company believes its shares are undervalued and is a way to reward investors. Lynch sees share buybacks as a very positive move, often more beneficial than other use of capital like dividends or acquisitions​.

My examples: Apple (AAPL) &amp; Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)",58,18,conquistudor,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ftwftk/challenge_to_find_stocks_matching_13_attributes/,1ftwftk
2024-09-15 18:48:48,r/stocks,Are there any companies that aren't noticeably tainted by some sort of negative reputation?,"While it's probably true that no company is completely ""clean,"" since the world of business often demands that they take any viable steps to preserve their bottom lines, are there any companies that exist that haven't accumulated any significant negative reputations in the court of public opinion?

It seems like they're hard to find, if they even exist at all. No matter what sector, there's some form of criticism that goes against them...

* Communication Services: Oligopolies (internet service companies), data privacy issues (GOOG, META)
* Consumer Discretionary: Anti-union practices and exploitation (AMZN, NKE)
* Consumer Staples: Anti-union practices and exploitation (WMT, TGT), environmental and health concerns (KO, MO)
* Energy: Environmental and health concerns (oil/gas companies)
* Financials: Reckless banking practices (pretty much any bank)
* Health Care: Price gouging (drug companies, health insurance companies)
* Industrials: Endangerment (weapons companies), environmental and health concerns (transportation companies)
* Information Technology: Monopoly attempts and data privacy concerns (AAPL, MSFT)
* Materials: Environmental and health concerns (any chemicals company)

2024-08-01 20:13:46,r/stocks,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&amp;P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&amp;P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&amp;P 500 over the next 24 months.

-The consumer is getting weaker, unemployment is rising, so are default rates. People are shopping at discount stores looking for deals and financing purchases with buy now pay later. I think the American consumer will switch from spending to saving.

2024-05-16 13:04:18,r/stocks,Walmart earnings beat as discounter wins over more high-income shoppers ,"Walmart on Thursday topped quarterly revenue and earnings expectations, as the discounter made significant e-commerce gains, drove profits with newer businesses like advertising and won over more high-income shoppers.

The big-box retailer said it now expects to hit the high-end or slightly top its previous full-year guidance. Walmart had expected net sales growth of 3% to 4% and adjusted earnings per share of between $2.23 and $2.37.

In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said one of the factors boosting Walmart’s grocery business is the widening gap between the price of cooking at home and buying food at restaurants.

Plus, he added, shoppers – especially with higher-incomes – appreciate the convenience that Walmart offers. For the first time, its delivery business surpassed its store pickup in terms of volume, Rainey said.

“We’ve got customers that are coming to us more frequently than they have before and newer customers that we haven’t traditionally had, and they’re coming into a Walmart whether it’s a virtual store online, or whether it’s one of our physical stores,” he said.

Here’s what the discounter reported for the three-month period that ended April 30 compared with what Wall Street expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 60 cents adjusted vs. 52 cents expected

Revenue: $161.51 billion vs. $159.50 billion

Walmart’s net income jumped to $5.10 billion, or 63 cents per share, compared with $1.67 billion, or 21 cents per share, in the year-ago period.

Revenue climbed 6% from $152.30 billion in the year-ago quarter. That increase includes a benefit of roughly 1% from an additional selling day in the period. 

As the nation’s largest retailer and private employer, Walmart is often viewed as a bellwether for the U.S. economy. Yet it has generally fared better during an inflationary period than other retailers because it sells staples like groceries and has a value-oriented reputation. That trend continued in the quarter, as the company 

Same-store sales for Walmart U.S. climbed by 3.8%, excluding fuel. The industry metric includes sales from stores and clubs open for at least a year. At Sam’s Club, same-store sales rose 4.4% year over year, excluding fuel.

E-commerce sales shot up by 22% year over year for Walmart U.S., fueled by store pickup and delivery of online orders, as well as the company’s growing third-party marketplace. 

The company also grew high-margin businesses like advertising as it pushes to increase its earnings faster than its sales.

2024-04-21 01:29:41,r/stocks,WMT vs COST? ,"Disclaimer: I own WMT shares. 

I’m curious what you guys think about how these two compare 

Being as how Walmart has a significant presence in both general retail/groceries *and* warehouse sales, wouldn’t it make sense to invest in them over Costco? 

Walmart has a rapidly expanding e-commerce presence, a wide moat and is consistently looking for additional sources of revenue (Vizio purchase, Ibotta investment etc). What would make an investor chose Costco over Walmart?

2024-02-20 14:12:59,r/stocks,Walmart beats Wall Street’s holiday expectations as e-commerce sales soar,"Walmart said Tuesday that quarterly revenue rose 6%, as shoppers turned to the big-box retailer throughout the holiday season and the company’s global e-commerce sales grew by double digits. 

The retail giant also announced Tuesday that it would acquire smart TV maker Vizio to accelerate growth of its advertising business. Walmart is acquiring the company for $2.3 billion, or $11.50 per share. 

In a CNBC interview, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said customers have still shown discretion with purchases. They are putting fewer items in their baskets but shopping more frequently, he said. Electronics, TVs, computers and some other expensive items have been a tougher sell, Rainey added.

Yet, he said even after the holiday rush, Walmart saw continued sales strength.

Here’s what Walmart reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $1.80 adjusted vs. $1.65 expected

Revenue: $173.39 billion vs. $170.71 billion expected

In the three-month period that ended Jan. 31, Walmart’s net income fell to $5.49 billion or $2.03 per share, compared with $6.28 billion, or $2.32 per share, in the year-ago period.

Revenue increased from $164.05 billion in the year-ago period.

Walmart said it expects consolidated net sales to rise 4% to 5% in its fiscal first quarter. It also anticipates adjusted earnings of $1.48 to $1.56 per share on a pre-stock split basis.

For its fiscal 2025, the retailer expects consolidated net sales will climb 3% to 4%. Walmart anticipates adjusted earnings will be $6.70 to $7.12 per share on a pre-stock split basis.

Walmart has weathered high inflation better than many other retailers. It has used its value reputation to draw in families across income levels and has leaned into new ways to make money, such as selling ads, expanding its third-party marketplace and offering a subscription-based program called Walmart+.

Comparable sales, an industry metric also known as same-store sales, rose 4% for Walmart U.S. At Sam’s Club, comparable sales increased 1.9%, including fuel. 

Global e-commerce sales jumped 23% year over year, topping $100 billion in total. In the U.S., e-commerce rose 17% as shoppers used curbside pickup and got orders delivered to their homes.

Advertising has been a fruitful business for Walmart, too. It grew about 33% globally and 22% in the U.S. year over year.

Rainey said the Vizio acquisition will be “an accelerant” for the “high-margin, fast-growing part of our business.”

In the U.S., customer transactions increased 4.3% compared with the year-ago period. However, average ticket, or the amount that a customer spent, declined slightly. 

On its fiscal third-quarter earnings call in November, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said the company could soon face a deflationary environment, where prices are not just stabilizing, but going down. He said those lower prices could help customers pay for more discretionary items.

On Tuesday, however, Rainey said Walmart sees deflation as less likely now. In some categories of general merchandise, prices are lower than a year ago.

Yet, he added, food prices still rose by low single digits year over year.

“The possibility overall [of deflation] still remains, but prices are more stable than where they were three months ago,” he said.

As many other companies have announced cost cuts, Walmart has done the opposite. It announced in late January that it would open or expand more than 150 stores in the U.S. over the next five years. That’s on top of an aggressive plan to upgrade more than 1,400 of its existing Walmart stores to have a more modern look.

Along with those store investments, Walmart said it would raise store manager wages to an average of $128,000 per year and make managers eligible for a bonus of up to 200% of their base salary.

It also announced a 3-for-1 stock split in late January, as shares hovered near an all-time high.

Shares of Walmart closed Friday at $170.36, up about 8% so far this year. The stock has outperformed the S&amp;P 500, which rose about 5% during the same period.

2024-02-09 16:03:06,r/stocks,What Walmart’s ($WMT) stock split means for the Dow Jones.,"Walmart recently announced a 3 for 1 stock split, a significant move considering its status as a major component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Since the Dow is a price-weighted index, this split will decrease Walmart’s weighting in the index, initiating a rebalance to accommodate the drop in price.

It's intriguing to note that the Dow has been trailing behind the S&amp;P 500 in performance YTD, increasing ~2.6% and ~5.4% respectively. 

Potentially prompting the index to consider adding new stocks to compensate for the YTD underperformance.

The last time the Dow underwent a significant change was in August 2020. At that time, Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell were added, while Exxon, Pfizer, and RTX Corp were removed.

Unlike their usual practices, the Dow committee has delayed making changes for an extended period of time, reminiscent of the period from June 2009 to September 2012.

With the Dow undergoing rebalancing, I’m eyeing potential exits for IBM, Cisco, Intel, Verizon, and Walgreens Boots Alliance.  

Additionally, I could see potential additions like Amazon, META, and Eli Lilly who have a wider touch on the economy.

2024-01-30 23:25:06,r/stocks,Walmart announces 3-for-1 stock split as shares hover below all-time high,"Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) announced that it will conduct a split of its outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of 3:1. The stock split is part of Walmart’s ongoing review of optimal trading and spread levels and its desire for its associates to feel that purchasing shares is easily within reach. More than 400,000 associates participate in Walmart’s Associate Stock Purchase Plan today, which allows eligible associates to buy stock conveniently through payroll deductions and provides a 15% company match on the first $1,800 each year.

“Sam Walton believed it was important to keep our share price in a range where purchasing whole shares, rather than fractions, was accessible to all of our associates,” said Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart. “Given our growth and our plans for the future, we felt it was a good time to split the stock and encourage our associates to participate in the years to come. As Sam said, ‘We’re all in this together. That’s the secret.’”

For more than 60 years, Walmart has been focused on helping people save money and live better, including its 2.1 million associates worldwide. Walmart has focused on creating a path of opportunity for associates by offering good jobs and great careers, with continued investments in compensation, attractive healthcare, financial and educational benefits. As part of the benefits provided to its associates, Walmart has had an Associate Stock Purchase Plan for almost 30 years. Today’s stock split is just the latest action aimed at helping strengthen associates’ financial health.

The shares to be issued in the stock split will be payable after market close on Friday, Feb. 23, 2024, for shareholders of record at the close of business on Thursday, Feb. 22, 2024. Shareholders will receive a distribution of two additional shares of common stock for each share held. Walmart's common stock will begin trading on a post-split basis at the market open on Monday, Feb. 26, 2024, under the company's existing trading symbol “WMT.” The stock split and final ratio were approved by Walmart's board.

The company expects that the stock split will increase the number of shares of Walmart’s outstanding common stock from approximately 2.7 billion shares to approximately 8.1 billion shares.

As a result of the stock split, proportionate adjustments will be made to the number of shares of Walmart's common stock underlying the company's outstanding stock awards and warrants; the number of shares issuable under the company's equity incentive plans and other existing agreements, as well as the exercise or conversion price, as applicable; the company’s common stock dividend; and the company’s authorized buyback programs. The company anticipates filing a Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after the effective date to report an amendment to the company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation effecting the stock split and reflecting a proportionate adjustment to the total number of authorized shares of company common stock.

Mostly a dividend portfolio with positions in mostly what I feel are “value” dividend stocks. Even though I’m up 15% this past year, I’m trailing the market and have gone back and forth on just going 100% VOO (I’m really struggling with my pride indexing). I’m in my early 40s so a minimum’s of 15 years to expected retirement age. 
What I’m considering is selling out of all of these positions and narrow this to 10 holdings at 10% each. The 10 I’m considering are not what I would consider value but great companies. Examples would be: MSFT, V, COST, UNH, APPL, NVDA, AMZN, WMT, MCD, and O.

2023-10-06 18:53:26,r/stocks,43 years old and I just invested in stocks for the first time in my life,"Hi everyone!

I decided to post here because I'm anxious, scared, and excited at the same time because I finally saved up some money and invested it for the first time.  I quit drinking beer and buying useless crap, and saved up (don't laugh) $1,000 dollars and had it sitting there in a credit union with pennies for interest and I didn't like that.  

I'm really kicking myself for not doing this when I was younger.  I remember when I was in my mid 20's ""this close"" to making a brokerage account and getting started, and I never did it.  Did this scare any of you the first time you got in to trading?  

The first share I bought was 1 full share in the Vanguard VGT ETF.  I know it sounds dumb, but it was pretty scary and exciting at the same time.  My position is focusing 80% ETFs and sprinkle in some individual stocks to play around with.  

My primary goal is dividends and compound reinvesting, in the hopes that I can have a nice-ish passive income 20-30 years from now.  I'm wondering what you guys think of my current positions:

**ETFs:** VGT, VONG, VTI, SCHD, and SCHG

**Stocks** *(I bought fractions of these)*:  AAPL, AMZN, HD, JNJ, KO, MSFT, NVDA, O, RTX, WM, WMT

That was my attempt of diversifying.  I have been reading until my eyes bleed, and I really have no idea if what I'm doing is considered smart or not.  But for the first time, checking my portfolio today.. seeing I'm up 1.24% with everything in green (short of stupid Wal\*Mart)...  

I'm up a whopping $10!  And I think that's pretty cool!!!  Now how in the hell do I make that **bajillions**?

* From 2025 through 2029, a nine-person council will have the authority to raise the hourly minimum wage annually for affected businesses.  Workers will get at least CPI.  If higher than 3.5% minimum that amount and council will determine pay.

* Tickers mentioned in article CMG, YUM, QSR, MCD, DPZ, AMZN, TGT, WMT

-----------------

Fast-food workers in California are set to receive pay hikes next year after the restaurant industry and unions reached a compromise over a controversial bill.

The deal, brokered with the help of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office, also creates a nine-person council that will decide on future wage hikes for the fast-food industry in California through 2029. The agreement ends a fight between the two sides that threatened to stretch out for years. The restaurant industry was gearing up to spend more than $100 million on the battle.

The deal will mean a wage floor of $20 for California workers at fast-food chains with at least 60 locations nationwide, starting April 1. And from 2025 through 2029, the appointed council will have the authority to raise the hourly minimum wage annually by whichever is lower: 3.5% or the annual change in the consumer price index.

The council will include four representatives from the fast-food industry, four from the workers’ side and one neutral party who will serve as chair.

While fast-food operators will have to cope with paying higher wages, the agreement thwarts more dire consequences, according to industry analysts.

“I certainly wouldn’t say it’s catastrophic, and certainly not as bad as it could have played out over the next year or two,” said Mark Kalinowski, CEO of Kalinowski Equity Research.

California lawmakers rushed to conclude the matter before the legislative session ends midnight Friday. The state senate passed the bill Thursday, and the state assembly has concurred with the upper house’s amendments. Newsom, a Democrat, has already pledged to sign the bill into law.

**California’s fast-food fight**

Newsom signed AB 257, also known as the FAST Act, into law in January. The legislation would have created a 10-person council that would govern fast-food chains with more than 60 locations, including setting guidelines for working conditions and wages. The initial wage hike could have been as high as $22 an hour.

But the fast-food industry was attacking the bill before it even made its way to Newsom’s desk. State records show that Chipotle Mexican Grill, Chick-fil-A, Yum Brands and Restaurant Brands International were among the chains that spent money to lobby California lawmakers to oppose the legislation.

McDonald’s U.S. President Joe Erlinger wrote a letter posted on the company’s website, making a rare public statement on a political issue. Erlinger called the bill “lopsided” and “ill-considered,” attacking lawmakers for not targeting all restaurants. As of 2022, just under 10% of McDonald’s U.S. restaurants were located in California, according to Citi Research. Most are run by franchisees.

The restaurant industry retaliated, gathering enough signatures to create a referendum that would make California’s voters decide on the matter. The Service Employees International Union, which backed the FAST Act, alleged in a lawsuit that the industry misled signatories, but a judge ruled against the union. The referendum was supposed to be on November 2024 ballots.

In response to the referendum, the SEIU backed another bill, AB 1228. The bill would impose joint-employer liability on franchised businesses — including the very restaurant chains that loudly decried AB 257.

Under the bill, franchisors like McDonald’s would be held liable for infractions committed by their franchisees. Opponents said that the bill attacked the very nature of the franchising model. AB 1228′s provisions were originally included in AB 257 but removed before Newsom signed it into law.

The California State Assembly passed AB 1228 in early June. But the state’s Senate never had the chance to vote on that version.

Instead, the restaurant industry and the unions struck a deal, replacing the joint-employer provisions with the terms of their agreement, which also includes repealing the FAST Act and withdrawing the referendum by Jan. 1.

**What’s next for workers?**

Fast-food workers employed by affected restaurants will see pay increases of as much as 25% hit their paychecks starting in April. The current California minimum wage is $15.50 an hour, with a bump to $16 set for January.

Employees of smaller fast-food joints and other restaurants could also reap some benefits from the legislation.

“When you look at the $20 minimum wage, that’s a bar that’s being set,” Joe Pawlak, managing principal of restaurant consulting firm Technomic, told CNBC. “That’s going to make the restaurant industry a lot more competitive for employees, so other industries are going to have to also step up.”

In recent years, Amazon warehouses and retailers like Walmart and Target have lured workers away with higher hourly pay. Now they’ll be forced to compete with fast-food chains, which have traditionally been slower to raise wages due to operators’ razor-thin margins.

Other states, like Minnesota or New York, could also follow California’s lead and craft similar councils to govern restaurants or other industries, Pawlak said.

″[The deal] puts a model in place with a structure that everybody is able to digest,” he said.

Still, labor’s side had to make some trade-offs to get the deal in California. One key concession is that the council won’t have the power to set working conditions. Instead, the Fast Food Council will only be able to recommend proposed standards to state agencies.

But that doesn’t mean that unions won’t keep trying to push for better conditions.

“Fast-food workers’ fight in California isn’t close to over — it has only just begun as they prepare to take their seat at the table and help transform their industry for the better,” SEIU President Mary Kay Henry said in a statement to CNBC.

**What does it mean for restaurants?**

Faced with a mandate to pay higher wages, fast-food operators will have to decide how they plan to deal with elevated labor costs. Some may raise menu prices, although customers may balk at having to foot the bill. Others may try to make do with fewer workers on hand or to invest in automation to handle more tasks.

But it’s not all gloomy for restaurants.

“This agreement protects local restaurant owners from significant threats that would have made it difficult to continue to operate in California. It provides a more predictable and stable future for restaurants, workers, and consumers,” Sean Kennedy, executive vice president of public affairs at the National Restaurant Association, said in a statement.

The chief uncertainty resolved by the deal is the referendum slated for November 2024 ballots. The industry had already spent more than $64 million on the referendum, according to California records, and was preparing to spend much more. But it would be difficult to predict which side voters would take.

″[The agreement] shows just how concerned the industry was,” Kalinowski said. “The referendum would have been very challenging, to have it come out their way.”

On top of that, restaurant chains like In-N-Out now save some cash that otherwise would have gone toward the industry’s war chest.

The deal also avoids the change to joint-employer liability that was feared by the broader franchising industry.

“This allows the franchise model to exist,” said Dana Kravetz, a Los Angeles-based labor attorney at Michelman &amp; Robinson.

Fast-food companies with heavily franchised footprints, like McDonald’s, KFC, Taco Bell and Domino’s Pizza, will largely escape the effects of the bill, unless they have company-owned locations in California.

Instead, their franchisees will have to grapple with how to pay higher wages. The National Owners Association, an independent advocacy group of McDonald’s franchisees, plans to push back. In a memo viewed by CNBC, the NOA projects the bill will cost each restaurant in the state $250,000 annually.

Restaurant companies that don’t franchise will have to foot the bill for increased labor costs themselves. That includes Chipotle Mexican Grill, which has 457 locations — or 14% of its total footprint — in its home state of California.",98,39,absoluteunitVolcker,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16jk0tb/a_fight_between_fastfood_chains_and_unions_in/,16jk0tb

Today people are beginning to realize a high PE is not what it used to be. The entire way companies are run is different. In the 1990s if a company had a high PE it was almost always because of having high debt, not having a good price point on products relative to consumer spending, etc. Today that is all out the window.

*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 15 points. Futures linked to the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 were also up slightly.
*****
&gt; Regional banks were set to build on their strong gains from the previous session. The SPDR S&amp;P Regional Bank ETF (KRE) traded 1.3% higher after rising more than 7% on Wednesday. Shares of PacWest popped nearly 6%.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a strong session, with the major averages jumping more than 1% each on Wednesday, as hope for a possible debt ceiling deal grew.
*****
&gt; House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Wednesday that he does not believe the U.S. will default on its debt. President Joe Biden also stated in later remarks that he was confident lawmakers would come together to reach a deal and avoid a default.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, Wells Fargo’s head of equity strategy Chris Harvey was skeptical that progress has been made in Washington on the debt ceiling talks.
*****
&gt; “We still think that macro is going to start to weigh over things. We think people are getting too excited about the debt ceiling in the short term. And we think that there’s probably some more downside as we go forward in time,” Harvey said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
&gt; “We think it’s going to get a little bit more tenuous as we go forward in time,” he continued. “We do think a deal [will] get done, but we think it’s too optimistic at this point in time.”
*****
&gt; Investors will be looking toward retail giant Walmart’s earnings report Thursday for insights on the health of the consumer. China-based tech giant Alibaba is also set to report earnings before the bell.
*****
&gt; Wall Street will also watch out for the weekly jobless claims numbers to gauge the strength of the labor market. The Philadelphia Fed’s manufacturing survey numbers for May, as well as existing home sales data for April, are also slated to be released Thursday morning.

2023-05-18 13:19:21,r/stocks,"Walmart raises full-year guidance, as earnings beat on boost from grocery and online businesses","https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/18/walmart-wmt-q1-2024.html

Walmart raised its full-year forecast Thursday, as fiscal first-quarter sales rose nearly 8% and its large grocery business helped offset weaker sales of clothing and electronics. 

The discounter said it now anticipates consolidated net sales will rise about 3.5% in the fiscal year. It expects adjusted earnings per share for the full year will be between $6.10 and $6.20.

Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said consumers are trading down to smaller pack sizes, buying fewer discretionary items and waiting for promotions before making pricey purchases like TVs.

Yet shoppers are still spending, he added. 

Here’s what Walmart reported for the three-month period that ended April 30, according to Refinitiv consensus estimates:

Earnings per share: $1.47 adjusted vs. $1.32 expected
Revenue: $152.30 vs. $148.76 billion expected
Net income for the big-box retailer fell to $1.67 billion, or 62 cents per share, compared with $2.05 billion, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. 

Total revenue rose to $152.30 billion from $141.57 billion in the year-ago period, beating Wall Street’s expectations.

Same-store sales for Walmart U.S. rose 7.4%, excluding fuel. The key industry metric includes sales from stores and clubs open for at least a year. E-commerce sales jumped 27% year over year for Walmart U.S.

Despite sales growth, Rainey said Walmart saw spending get slower as the quarter went on. He attributed that, in part, to the end of pandemic-related emergency funding from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and a decline in tax refund amounts. 

Shares of Walmart closed Wednesday at $149.53, bringing its market value to $403.33 billion. Its stock has climbed nearly 6% year to date. Shares have trailed the S&amp;P 500′s roughly 8% gain and the XRT’s nearly 2% gain during the same period.",422,59,_hiddenscout,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13kw2ud/walmart_raises_fullyear_guidance_as_earnings_beat/,13kw2ud
2023-04-25 03:09:15,r/stocks,How to best allocate final 15% of my porfolio?,"Hi there! 

&amp;#x200B;

I will try to keep this brief, but would really love to have some conversations with others about my allocation because I keep thinking myself in circles.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently my portfolio is:   


* Spy/Voo: 47% 
* VXUS: 15% 
* Target Date - 2055: 7%
* SCHD:  5%
* QQQ:  1%
* Individual Stocks:  23% (3% Appl, 3% MSFT, 3% CRM, 3% ABBV, 2% Cost, 2% UNH, 2% JPM, 2% BRK.B, 2% WMT)

&amp;#x200B;

I have been targeting a portfolio that will have roughly: 

* SPY: 40%
* Target Date: 30% 
* VXUS: 10%
* ???: 15% 
* Individual Stocks: 5%

&amp;#x200B;

(Context, the VXUS will go down as my 401k invests into target date fund which is already 1/3 VXUS but I will use my personal brokerage to help rebalance as needed)

&amp;#x200B;

I have held most of the individual stocks for quite a few years, its how I got started investing. They have all done well, luckily to some degree and some due to not touching for a few years. 

I have gone back and forth researching, and thinking myself in circles. I have considered just selling my positions in Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, etc and buying QQQ to keep a large cap growth tilt but worry it is just chasing performance. 

I have considered heavily SCHD and AVUV; SCHD for the drip effect in my roth to let it accumulate tax free but just havent found a reason to have conviction given my timeline is 20-30 years. AVUV in theory sounds good, the short track record and the ability to stomach downturns of SCV at 10-15% of my portfolio is possible but there isnt a ton of data to back up the fund. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would love others thoughts and opinions on this, I have been in a mental pretzel for weeks thinking about this.",23,16,silenceisbetter1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12y39k6/how_to_best_allocate_final_15_of_my_porfolio/,12y39k6
2023-04-24 05:36:17,r/stocks,"Searching for ETF tool with X,Y,Z stocks in them","Let’s say I want an ETF with Aapl, Mcd, and WMT. 

Is there a ETF screener that will spit out ETFs that have the stocks I am interested in holding ideally with a decent amount of weight in said ETF.

Here are the stocks I am interested in:

1) Aapl
2) Mcd
3) Pepsi
4) ABT &amp;ABBV
5) JNJ
6) MSFT
7) WMT
8) GOOG/Googl

1-3 I would love to have all 3 be a large contributor in an ETF. 

4-8: I would love to have all of these be weighted as close as possible to each other.

Edit: For anyone wondering the same thing , I decided to buy individual stocks instead of and ETF. Paying a high MER for an ETf that I liked the portfolio and weighting of is annoying and unnecessary. I like selling “safe covered calls” so this works out well.

ETFchannel was a godsend for getting to this decision since they have a tool that searches for the desired stocks with their total weighting.",13,1,ladyvirg,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12x1oqg/searching_for_etf_tool_with_xyz_stocks_in_them/,12x1oqg

# [Stock futures rise as Wall Street bets banking crisis has stabilized: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/29/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Thursday, building on the sharp gains from the previous session, as traders bet the regional banking crisis has stabilized.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 199 points, or 0.6% higher. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures were also up 0.6% and 0.55%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Regional banks ticked higher in the premarket, with the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) advancing nearly 1%. The ETF has gained 7% from its March 23 crisis low of $42.24, as investors posit that the central bank has reined in any further banking contagion. Shares of Western Alliance and PacWest gained 3% and 2%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The major averages entered Thursday’s session up solidly for the week. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow were up more than 1%, while the Nasdaq gained 0.9% through Wednesday’s close.
*****
&gt; The moves over the course of the week stem from Wall Street’s attempts to weigh varying factors, said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. Those factors, he said, include the latest batch of corporate earnings, the future path of interest rates and potential for a recession and, as of recent weeks, the state of the banks.
*****
&gt; “There’s always been the natural seesaw, but it’s sort of never been like this,” he said. “There’s just so many things that are on investors’ minds.”
*****
&gt; The three major indexes ended Wednesday higher, with the Nasdaq Composite leading the way with a roughly 1.8% jump. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow followed at 1.4% and 1% higher, respectively.
*****
&gt; On Thursday, investors will watch for economic data on weekly jobless claims and the gross domestic product. Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari are all slated to speak in the afternoon.

2023-03-03 00:41:57,r/stocks,Costco Q2 Earnings: Stock slips after mixed results,"https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/costco-q2-earnings-stock-slips-after-mixed-results-213931097.html

Costco (COST) posted fiscal second-quarter earnings results Thursday, March 2, after market close that mostly beat expectations. Shares were down more than 2% after the release.

As consumers sought out value and moved away from discretionary spending, the wholesale retailer saw a slight miss in quarterly revenue, coming in at $55.27 billion, but up 6.5% from a year ago. Meanwhile net sales saw a 6.5% increase, to $54.24 billion, up from $50.04 billion.

Here's what Costco reported, compared to Wall Street estimates, based on Bloomberg consensus data:

Revenue: $55.27 billion versus $55.58 billion expected

Adjusted earnings per share: $3.30 versus $3.21 expected

Same-store sales: up 6.8% versus up 6.16% expected

United States: up 5.8% versus up 5.56% expected

Canada: up 9.6% versus up 5.51% expected

Other international: 9.5% versus up 7.10% expected

""People are spending their dollars where they feel they should be spending them,"" CEO Craig Jelinek said on a call with investors. The retailer saw an increase in sales in the fresh food, food, and sundry categories and ""weakness in big ticket discretionary items"" with a drop in non-food items such as apparel, jewelry and electronics. This is similar to results from Target (TGT) and Walmart's (WMT) latest earnings.

In the U.S., sales came in slightly lower than expected, up 5.8% compared to estimates of 5.56%. Meanwhile, in Canada and internationally, Costco saw strength with same-store sales, both higher than estimates, up 9.6% and 9.5%, respectively.

Last quarter, e-commerce sales were down 9.6%.

Giving an outlook into the first few weeks of Q3 FY 23, in the first four weeks of February, U.S. sales are up 3.4% and up 1.2% in Canada. For its international business, sales are up 6.5%. E-commerce sales saw a decline of -11.2% in the month of February. Last month, the company saw net sales of $17.06 billion, up 4.7% from $16.29 billion last year.

Its private label business, Kirkland Brands, is also getting a boost from inflation. In the last few months, the company saw ""a bigger delta than normal"" to Kirkland Brands. For Q2, the company saw a roughly 1.5% increase in sales of Kirkland Brands, specifically food penetration, compared to roughly 0.5% typically. Jelinek jokingly called it a ""trade-up,"" adding, ""People are looking to save money, and it's our brand, that's great, creates loyalty.""

In the call with investors, Jelinek reiterated, similar to previous quarters, ""It's a question of when, not-if,"" it will raise prices. He then referred to its typical time line of membership fee increases, which is every 5 years and seven months, bringing the next potential hike to ... now.

Costco last raised prices in June 2017.

Jelinek remains confident that the wholesale retailer remains on top, saying, ""Our relative level of competitiveness is as strong as it's ever been.""

This quarter, membership fees brought in $1.03 billion, up 6.2% from a year ago and a tick higher than Wall Street estimates of $1.04 billion.

Stifel, which holds a Buy rating on the stock, expects ""greater clarity over the next approximately six months,"" however, that may be delayed due to the current macro environment. ""It is possible a weaker consumer environment and strong comparable store sales and renewal rates could delay an increase relative to historical timing.""

A Costco Gold Star membership costs $60 per year and an Executive Membership goes for $120.

That's compared to Sam’s Club, owned by Walmart (WMT), which raised prices in August for the first time since 1999. That move increased annual fees to $50 from $45 for Club members and to $110 from $100 for Plus members.

At BJ's, the basic membership costs $55 per a year and its perk rewards membership is $110.",62,11,Puginator,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11gkq9r/costco_q2_earnings_stock_slips_after_mixed_results/,11gkq9r
2023-02-21 13:06:51,r/stocks,Walmart easily beats expectations for holiday-quarter sales and earnings,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/21/walmart-wmt-earnings-q4-2023.html

Walmart on Tuesday topped holiday-quarter earnings expectations, as the discounter said it drew budget-conscious shoppers searching for food, gifts and household items at a lower price.

Here’s what the company reported for the fiscal fourth quarter that ended Jan. 31, according to Refinitiv consensus estimates:

Earnings per share: $1.71, adjusted vs. $1.51 expected

Revenue: $164.05 billion vs. $159.72 billion expected

The big-box retailer said it expects same-store sales for Walmart U.S. to rise by between 2% and 2.5% excluding fuel, in the fiscal year ahead. It said it expects adjusted earnings per share to range from $5.90 to $6.05, excluding fuel.

In a call with CNBC, Walmart’s CFO John David Rainey said grocery prices still remain elevated, which is causing shoppers to buy fewer discretionary items.

“The consumer is still very pressured,” he said. “And if you look at economic indicators, balance sheets are running thinner and savings rates are declining relative to previous periods. And so that’s why we take a pretty cautious outlook on the rest of the year.”

Walmart reported a net income of $ 6.28 billion, or $2.32, up from $3.56 billion, or $1.28, a year earlier. 

Same-store sales for Walmart U.S. rose 8.3%, excluding fuel. The key industry metric that includes sales from stores and clubs open for at least a year. E-commerce sales jumped by 17% year over year for Walmart U.S.

The company is not only the nation’s largest retailer. It’s also a grocery powerhouse, a factor that has steadied sales and driven foot traffic as Americans watch the budget because of high inflation. 

Walmart’s reputation for value has helped the retailer – as has its large grocery business. It is the largest grocer in the country by revenue. 

At Sam’s Club, same-store sales rose 12.2%, excluding fuel.

The company’s e-commerce sales in the U.S. increased/decreased TK% compared with the year-ago quarter. 

Shares of Walmart closed on Friday at $146.44, bringing the company’s market cap to nearly $395 billion. The company’s shares are up about 3% so far this year, underperforming the S&amp;P 500′s approximately 6% gain during the same period.",185,107,Puginator,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1181x41/walmart_easily_beats_expectations_for/,1181x41
2023-02-08 01:46:47,r/stocks,Portfolio critique,"Background first: I am a 20m college student with \~1000 in a roth and \~6500 in taxable (mostly from gifts). I have been investing since 2020 and have definitely learned some hard lessons along the way. The past 1.5 years I have greatly shifted focus from a quick buck to planning on never selling. Most of my taxable account is individual stocks with 10-30+ year outlook. Moving forward, all of my focus will be on my roth until I have 401k/trad IRA/have income above roth. I have followed this and other subs closely for a while and tried to learn as much as I can. I currently have my roth split across 5 funds which I want to ask about and be critiqued on. 

All portfolio % based on 15-20 year timeframe, but will reallocate as I learn and change with time

1: SCHD, planning for 20-30% of my portfolio

2: VOOG, I have high risk tolerance as a young person and thus have chosen VOOG over VOO/VTI. Goal is 30-40% of portfolio

3:RWL: This acts as my exposure to value stocks, an S&amp;P500 fund weighted by revenue rather than a traditional ""value"" fund. Goal 10-20%

4: ANGL: Bond exposure, still learning lots about this market. But I felt this was good initial choice to provide diversified corporate bond exposure and fixed income 10% goal

5: IYK: consumer staples ETF, consumer staples have a history of outperforming the market during periods of economic downturn. Exposure to this sector provides a nice buffer. 10% goal

With time I plant to add a limiting number of individual stocks, depending on timing, it would be no more than 15% of my portfolio, but my rough list is as follow: AAPL, F, KO, TM, UNH, COST, WMT, TGT, MSFT, MMM

As I near retirement I would rebalance my portfolio primarily through shedding individual stock as well as VOOG for either more SCHD, VOO, or VOOV.

2023-01-08 02:58:22,r/stocks,Amazon(AMZN) DCF Analysis need criticisms and advice,"# HISTORY:

The story of AMZN is one of trials and tribulation, it was not always smooth sailing where valuation steadily rose over the years. Rather, it was one that required a visionary CEO, one who had sufficient foresight to take gambles that paid off, one who could stomach the choppy seas of business cycles, one who had the determination and patience to see through their largest gambles. Having a humble beginning, AMZN’s IPO MC was valued at $430 Million before losing 95% of their valuation in the tech bubble crash. AMZN managed to survive the tech bubble crash but their valuation held rather steady at around 17 billion in the early 2000s. Meaning investors believed that AMZN could no longer grow past this threshold and have matured. Reaching 17 billion in valuation by itself would’ve been an impressive feat but it wouldn’t be enough for a story worthy for the history books as companies like WMT had a valuation of about 200 billion at the same point in time. AMZN released prime in 2005, their X factor to differentiate themselves from their competitor. Net income was 588 million that year but due to large investments into prime net income in 2006 fell to 190 million nearly 67%. Consequently, from 2005 to 2006 AMZN's MC fell nearly 20%  as investors did not fully believe in prime. But Jeff Bezos, believing in his dream for fast shipping, was unfazed by the whole ordeal and carried on investing heavily into the retail business. And this investment paid off as today we know AMZN as the 5th largest company by market cap in the world.

Tl;dr: Jeff Bezos I love you please sponsor my University fees.

# INTRODUCTION:

AMZN business model involves a few revenue sources, in no particular order.

1. Online Retail + Physical Store (AMZN Store): Their online retail website that generates the bulk of revenue, as physical stores have mostly stagnated and occupy a meager amount of revenue I'll combine both Online Retail and Physical Store into AMZN store in my DCF.
2. Amazon Web Services(AWS): Their cloud computing services which helps take businesses big and small into the cloud. Providing servers as well for firms. Brian Olsavsky described AWS as a business that helps firms change their fixed cost into variable cost, meaning firms pay more as they use more.
3. Third Party Services(3P): AMZN has extended their retail transport capabilities to their competitors allowing third party to set up their store on the webpage, leaving the problem of transporting the goods to AMZN.
4. Advertising: The latest significant addition to AMZN's top line, AMZN sold the capability for advertisers to have their products more visible to customers on their retail store and providing tools for advertisers to analyze the data collected.
5. Subscription: Lastly, Amazon Prime. Consisting of Prime video, Prime Gaming and Prime shipping.
6. Others: representing the other businesses that AMZN has tried breaking into like Twitch but for simplicity sake and because Others represented about 0.5% of revenue in 2021 I'll not forecast this in my DCF.

# REVENUE:

**AMZN store**:  
2022, Retail has been hit pretty hard due to inflationary pressures and Ukraine War bumping up costs. Retail has definitely taken a hard beating for 2022. As per 2022 Q3 earnings transcript, ""reduction in fulfilment and transportation capital investment...to better align with demand."" We can expect revenue to have taken a hit and definitely lower than 2021's 22% Y/Y.

Past 2022 however, I expect AMZN store to pick up as there is a large demand for the convenience provided by AMZN.  ""more than 90 percent of consumers expect two- to three-day delivery as the norm, while 30 percent expect same-day delivery."" - [(JPMorgan,1)](https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/treasury-payments/insights/why-shopping-has-changed-forever). Only AMZN is well situated in terms of fulfillment center, transportation and capacity for expansion to meet this goal. In fact, AMZN is expected to be the largest e-commerce platform world wide by 2027 [(Statista,2)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/) earning about 1.2 Trillion.

AMZN store is likely to have very high growth going into 2023 until at least 2025. It took AMZN about 2 years to double their fulfilment network from 2019 - 2020 hence the negative cash flows back then. So I'm assuming AMZN is going to be an aggressive grower with high revenues and low margins as AMZN will be expanding into new markets it'll probably minimally need to spend another 2 years doubling its current size. Hence I project high growth period from 2023 - 2025.  


**AWS:**  
2022, firms are likely to be more conservative in these uncertain times preferring to have more cash reserves in hand. AWS offers a pay-as-you-go approach, not requiring firms to tie up large capital into AWS and AWS helps business to reduce cost. As per 2022 Q3 earnings transcript, ""we've seen an uptick in AWS customers focused on controlling cost"" All that being said, I don't really expect any crazy amount of growth in AWS as companies are more likely to have their capital tied up in footing the bill for higher labor cost. Even management forecast growth ""more in the mid 20% growth rate"". Compared to 2021's Y/Y at 37.1% so 2022's Y/Y is about 13% lower than 2021's Y/Y growth rate.

AWS is likely to have high growth as well going into 2023 as management announces plans to introduce AWS to more regions ""launch of the AWS middle east region in August and the recent announcement to launch AWS Asia Pacific."" The cloud computing is a whole new realm of endless opportunities for Amazon to capitalize on, with the market expected to grow from 548 billion in 2022 to 1240 billion in 2027, [(marketsandmarkets,3)](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/cloud-computing-market-234.html) AWS being in a good spot at about 38% market share as of Q1 2022, [(statista, 4)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/967365/worldwide-cloud-infrastructure-services-market-share-vendor/) to capitalize on this large market. Similarly I expect high growth period from 2023 - 2025.  


**3P:**  
I was thinking about how exactly should I go about forecasting third party but due to a lack of available data I actually forecast 3P with respect to AMZN store.

Of course this was not just a random guess, 3P has always observed a direct relationship with AMZN store. Taking 3P revenue as a percentage of AMZN store from 2016 - 2021 that number has held steady at  a range of 25% - 43%, it makes logical sense as well for 3P to have a direct relationship with AMZN store as 3P are retailers facing the same economical environment faced by AMZN store.

So throughout my DCF, I took 3P's revenue as 33% of AMZN store, 33% is the average of 25% and 43%.3P undergoes same growth period Y/Y as AMZN store.

&amp;#x200B;

**Subscription:**  
Subscription was treated the same as 3P. My rationale for this was that you have to use AMZN store in order for a subscription to Amazon Prime to be useful for you. At least anecdotally, barring lord of the rings I have not really heard of any memorable titles on Prime Video. In fact, ""Seventy-nine percent of Amazon Prime users cite **free shipping** as the primary reason they subscribe to the service"", [(chainstoreage,5)](https://chainstoreage.com/technology/the-no-1-reason-people-subscribe-to-amazon-prime-is#:~:text=Seventy-nine%20percent%20of%20Amazon,%2C%20Twitch%2C%20or%20other%20benefits).

Subscription from 2016 - 2021 when taken as a percentage of AMZN store held steady at a range of 7% - 13%.

So throughout my DCF, I took Subscription's revenue as 10% of AMZN store, 10% being the average of 7% and 13%. Subscription undergoes same growth period Y/Y as AMZN store.  


**Advertising:**  
2022, I'd expect advertising to fall as the advertising industry has proven to be a cyclical one. Using GOOG as a proxy for example, advertising revenue for GOOG actually decreased Y/Y in Q3 so similar results can be expected for AMZN.

I won't expect very high growth for Advertising however as it is quite limited in terms of what can be advertised as compared to GOOG. For example, GOOG is able to advertise service companies but AMZN may not be able to advertise services on the retail webpage.

Regardless, AMZN is still a strong player in the advertising industry. By 2023, AMZN is expected to earn 7.1% of revenue in the digital advertising market worldwide, [(statistia,6)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/290629/digital-ad-revenue-share-of-major-ad-selling-companies-worldwide/).

I wouldn't expect much high growth for advertising as not much exciting news or technology was introduced for advertising that would significantly increase revenue.  


# EBIT:

As per Q3 2022 earnings transcript, ""drop in operating margin...we're working hard to make sure that current profitability is not the new normal."" Margins have taken a hit in 2022 due to higher labor costs from the tighter labor market and the Ukraine War affecting gas prices which affects energy prices affecting AWS' margins. I'd expect 2022's margins to be smaller than historical margins. The latest 3Y average margin was at 5.47%. Due to AMZN starting to lay off workers on 4th Jan 2023, I'd assume the margins were hit pretty hard, for them to have to further reduce expenses. Margins assumed at 4.5%.

AMZN's margins are not likely to significantly increase from 2023 - 2025 as AMZN is going to continue heavily reinvest back into the company so margins are most likely to go back to the norm of 5.47% by 2025 at the end of the high growth period.

But, as AMZN goes off their high growth period from 2026 onwards, margins are going to increase as they stop focusing on growing their business but start to become mature. I'd assume margins are about 9% by the end of my forecast period in 2031.  


# ASSUMPTIONS:

1. Taxes are taken to be 20%, 2021's tax rate was 19.26% so I'd assume in this similar conditions as closely as possible taxes are about 20%.
2. D&amp;A taken to be 7% with respect to revenue, historically from 2016 - 2021 D&amp;A with respect to revenue on average was 7%.
3. Other Ops Exp/Inc and Deferred income tax was omitted from being forecasted despite appearing on the cash flow statement as they were too meager so I opted for less granularity and omitted them.
4. Change in NWC taken to be -0.5% with respect to revenue, historically from 2016 - 2021 the average was -0.5%
5. CapEX assumed to be 11% for the high growth period from 2022 - 2025. Before decreasing to reflect a maturing company. A picture of CapEX and D&amp;A side by side: [https://imgur.com/qfOJPNF](https://imgur.com/qfOJPNF)   
positive net asset balance was taken throughout forecast period.
6. TGR taken to be 2%.
7. WACC is taken at 9.2%, Calculations is as such.

&amp;#x200B;

# QUESTIONS &amp; NOTES:

1. **WHY DID I GUESS AWS AND AMZN STORE ARE THE COMPONENTS GOING THROUGH HIGH GROWTH?**  
As per 2021 Q4 earnings transcript, ""40% of that capex is going into infrastructure, most of it feeding AWS...About just under 30% is fulfillment capacity, building warehouses -- warehouse only, not transportation. And then just under 25% is transportation capacity and building on our NACL network, principally globally."" So we can see AMZN believes in the growth of AMZN store and AWS so I think it's justified in my DCF to assume high growth for both.
2. **WHY DOES HIGH GROWTH STOP IN 2025?**  
AMZN’s actual valuation is very heavily dependent on how long the high growth period lasts for. No guidance was given for how long this period is going to be, but a decent guess for this would probably be 2 years from 2023. 2022 was a period of contraction from AMZN navigating higher labor costs and the Ukraine War. 2023 would be a good starting point for AMZN to begin expansion. Given that the AMZN network took 2 years to double. If 2 years later it doubles again to quadruple it is most likely able to also support other regions outside of the US to a competent degree.
3. **INACCURACY IN FORECASTING ADVERTISING**  
Data available for advertising is actually quite limited due to a lack of information from management and historically advertising has only been reported from 2019 onwards. As more financial reports become available for advertising the degree of accuracy of prediction increases, unfortunately only 3 years of data from 2019 - 2021 is available. The story for advertising business in AMZN is sadly just too murky and vague right now for me to paint you guys a decent scene.
4. **How much AMZN’s margins are actually going to be after the high growth period?**   historically AMZN always had low margins as they reinvested back heavily to the company. Once again a lack of suitable historical data, where we can observe how high margins could be with an average economical condition and with all investments paying off. 9% may be cutting it too little for AMZN, but better safe than sorry.
5. **LASTLY,**   
All my forecasting are based on me weighing all the factors and adjusting their impact according to how much impact I think they have. 

# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, I value AMZN at $115.61, it is undervalued compared to market's $84. This difference can probably be attributable to how strong the market thinks AMZN's high growth will be compared to mine. But, I do think that there are a lot of doomsayers especially in the news where literally every other day I'd open my preferred news app and see at least 3 different article about how inflation has not eased off to a great extent. Barring short term expectations, I really do see AMZN being a strong company with great free cash flow potential. 2022's 10-K is definitely going to make or break how investors view AMZN moving forward, Questions like ""Can AMZN finally break their negative CF?"" will finally have an answer and give investor some kind of confidence. 4/5 of AMZN's revenue sources are cyclical so they'd be overly affected by the current environment's pessimism.   
I see this 37% of difference in price not as risk but rather as an opportunity because I believe AMZN will minimally bounce back 37% sometime in the future, the question is just when.

For the last time, I appreciate any advice or comments on my DCF I really spent quite a lot of time on this DCF juggling between scouring for data and army left me literally devoting 70% of my weekends getting data. I've read the story AMZN has told and retold it in my own account and I hope this value adds to anyone even if no advice was given!

&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 199.37 points, or 0.59%, to 33,745.69, while the S&amp;P 500 climbed 0.48% to 3,965.34. The Nasdaq Composite finished just 0.01% above the flat line at 11,146.06.
*****
&gt; All of the major averages posted losses for the week. The Dow ended 0.01% lower. The S&amp;P 500 lost 0.69% for the week, while the Nasdaq ended 1.57% lower. All three indexes are positive for the month, however.
*****
&gt; The market was divided for much of the day, with the S&amp;P 500 trading mostly flat as investors started to reset expectations after a couple of rallies over the past week, beginning with the October CPI print. Stephanie Lang, chief investment officer at Homrich Berg, said this week is characterized by a “back-to-reality viewpoint.”
*****
&gt; “Following the big rally coming off the better-than-expected CPI print, the market’s digesting the current data, which is bringing things back to reality,” she said. “The rally that followed the CPI print we don’t feel was justified by fundamentals… The market’s also pricing in a soft landing here, which we don’t think is likely to occur. So when you hear the Fed officials coming out and reiterating their stance, you’re starting to see the market readjust to that.”
*****
&gt; On Friday, Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins expressed confidence that policymakers can tame inflation without doing too much damage to employment.
*****
&gt; St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said Thursday that “the policy rate is not yet in a zone that may be considered sufficiently restrictive.” He suggested that the appropriate zone for the federal funds rate could be in the 5% to 7% range, which is higher than what the market is pricing.
*****
&gt; ""We continue to think investors should place much more emphasis on the actual data and not focus too much on Fed rhetoric (the former will show where inflation is headed while the latter is fixated on where it was),” said Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge. “That said, investors are tired of battling the Fed’s daily tape bombs and the fear is it may take 2-3 more CPIs for officials to stop admonishing the market every time it tries to rally.”

&gt; # Do Stocks Really Like Gridlock?

&gt; The midterm elections are over, and the results aren’t 100% official yet, but we do know that we’ll have a divided government. As of now, the Democrats have 50 seats in the Senate to maintain control there, while the Republicans gained their 218th seat in the House to take control there. The bottom line though is neither the Senate nor the House has large majorities, in fact, they are both near historically small margins.

&gt; So that’s the big question, do stocks really like gridlock? Of course, things are never this simple, as there are so many other factors that matter to how stocks do, but it sure looks like gridlock could be a tailwind for stocks. Or at the very least, not a major headwind.

&gt; Here’s a chart that shows all the times since 1950 we’ve had a divided government and how the S&amp;P 500 did in those years. The average return for stocks was a very solid 15.7% under a divided government, with only one-year falling significantly back in 1981, while 2011 was nearly exactly breakeven. The other years saw some solid returns.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-176-800x297.png))**

&gt; As of now, it is expected the Republicans will take a three-seat majority in the House (this could change, but it’ll likely be near this number). This would be the smallest majority for the Republicans since 3 seats in 2001 and 2002. Here’s a great chart that shows just how rare it is to have a majority this small. Fun stat, the House moved to 435 seats in 1913, meaning 218 seats gives a party the majority. Fun stat #2, the Democrats controlled the House from 1955 to 1994, but things have been more even over recent years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-2-800x357.png))**

&gt; What exactly does a small-seat majority in the House mean? Odds are a small majority means there could be some gridlock, so do stocks like this? Below we show again this appears to be the case. When there is less than a 20-seat House majority, the S&amp;P 500 gained a median of 19.5% and was higher 12 out of 15 times when looking at the first year of a new Congress. In fact, 9 of the past 10 times there was a new Congress and a small majority, stocks finished higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-3-800x485.png))**

&gt; In conclusion, stocks really do appear to have no issues with a divided government and in many cases, stocks have done just fine under this scenario.

&gt; # Weakness Sets Up Bullish Thanksgiving Week/End-November Trade

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/983481ddc26e9faf09d4cbe60d182136/4dd2ef76a33815cb-d4/s500x750/221168352745363465f01d3a3261a2773c0690ab.jpg))**

&gt; The recent 21-year typical November graph here points to a seasonal cycle low point tomorrow, the 14th trading day of the month, the Friday before Thanksgiving and Op-Ex day. Thanksgiving week has a notorious “holiday fueled” bullish bias as do the last seven trading days of the month.

&gt; However, as you can see from the tables here of the history of the Thanksgiving trade the bullish bias has weakened over the last several years. The best short-term trade appears to be getting long into any weakness in the week or days before the holiday and selling any subsequent rally toward the end of Thanksgiving week or before month-end.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/afaf374bbaec07b073fabd03723ff324/4dd2ef76a33815cb-44/s500x750/bd219c6246d1918c7fc0bcee7ae9be9dd623cb64.jpg))**

&gt; First published in the 1987 Stock Trader’s Almanac, the Wednesday before and the Friday after Thanksgiving combined were up 34 times in 35 years. The only S&amp;P 500 decline was in 1964. Subsequently, this trend changed. In the 35 years since 1987, there have been 10 declines and 25 advances. See 2023 Stock Trader’s Almanac page 106 for more.

&gt; # Highest Bullish Sentiment of the Year

&gt; As we noted last week, this week's sentiment data is the first to encapsulate any reaction to last week's CPI number as well as the subsequent market rally. Although price action has been somewhat choppy and there have been plenty of other catalysts (FTX's collapse, more yield curve inversions, the missile strike in Poland) to balance out the inflation data and put investors back onto their heels, the latest AAII survey has shown a surge in bullish sentiment. The percentage of respondents reporting as optimistic jumped from 25.1% last week up to 33.5% this week. That is not only the largest one-week increase since the first week of June (when bulls rose by 12.2 percentage points) but is now the highest reading on bulls since the last week of 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111722-Sentiment-1.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment in turn dropped sharply falling to 40.2% for a decline of 6.8 percentage points. While an improvement, at the start of the month bearish sentiment had fallen by much more (both the last week of October and the first week of November saw double-digit week-over-week declines) and was at a much lower level of 32.9%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111722-Sentiment-2.png))**

&gt; The bull-bear spread has narrowed but still remains negative for the 33rd week in a row. If the spread remains negative into next week, it will tie the record streak from 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111722-Sentiment-3.png))**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111722-Sentiment-6.png))**

&gt; Neutral sentiment fell for a second week in a row with the total decline in that time eclipsing 10 percentage points. At 26.3%, it is down to the lowest level since the week of October 20th, implying that investors have become a bit more decisive in their respective market views.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111722-Sentiment-4.png))**

&gt; The AAII survey's more bullish turn this week was also seen in other readings on sentiment like the Investors Intelligence survey and the NAAIM Exposure Index. As a result, our sentiment composite which aggregates the findings of the three surveys into a single sentiment reading is back up to its highest reading since mid-August. Although the reading remains negative, it is no longer at the extreme levels that were common earlier this year.

&gt; # Consumer Discretionary's Muddled Relative Strength

&gt; Ranging from today's retail sales report to homebuilder sentiment to the earnings of some of the largest retailers like Target (TGT) and Lowe's (LOW), the economic and earnings calendar this week has given Consumer Discretionary stocks plenty of news to digest. Outside of the spring to late summer, the sector has generally been on the decline relative to the S&amp;P 500 in 2022. Last week, that relative strength line bounced right as it reached the late May low. However, over the past few days, it has been resuming its move lower, meaning it is back to underperforming.

&gt; While on a sector level the relative strength line has been falling, drilling down to the industry group level, there has been more variation. For example, even with some positive responses to earnings from the likes of Home Depot (HD) or Lowe's (LOW), the retailing industry has seen a sharp grind lower in its relative strength line versus the S&amp;P 500. Similarly, autos have seen a turn lower although it has been underperforming the S&amp;P for a longer period of time since the early fall. Meanwhile, Consumer Durables and Appliances (which includes stocks like the homebuilders and home appliance makers) has been moving higher. That move has paled in comparison to the relative strength of Consumer Services stocks (restaurants, cruise lines, hotels and resorts), though, as that group's line has surged over the past couple of months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-RSa.png))**

&gt; As mentioned above, retailers in the Consumer Discretionary sector have been underperforming the S&amp;P 500 lately but there is another group of retailers in which performance has been more solid. The Food &amp; Staples Retail industry is a component of the Consumer Staples sector, and its relative strength line has been trending higher since the spring lows. In fact, after the past week's move higher thanks in part to a strong response to Walmart (WMT) earnings, its relative strength line is approaching some of the highest levels of the past year, entirely recovering the massive drop from May in the wake of another, much more negatively received, WMT earnings report.

&gt; # How Bottoms Form. (It Might Surprise You.)

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 rallied again last week and was more than 10% off the October 12 closing lows, before selling off some yesterday. Nonetheless, the truth is the overall news really hasn’t really been that great, yet stocks have staged a strong rally over the past month. What gives?

&gt; Turns out, this is what tends to happen coming off major lows for stocks more often than not. Our friends at JPM Asset Management put together some of the best charts I’ve ever seen to describe this phenomenon. You can read the whole report from Michael Cembalest here.

&gt; They found that from the Eisenhower recession in 1957 to stagflation in the 1970s, to the early 1980s double dip recession, to the 1990 recession, stocks turned higher well before the other parts of the economy began to turn higher. As you can see below, stocks tended to bottom months (and sometimes years) before earnings, GDP, and payrolls officially turn higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-chart-166-800x527.png))**

&gt; More recently we saw similar action during the Financial Crisis and then again during the worst of COVID. I’ll never forget how stocks soared in April, May, and June of 2020, yet we saw some of the very worst headlines in our country’s history. The truth is the stock market isn’t looking in the rear-view mirror, it is always looking forward and discounting what could be out there in the future.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-chart-245-800x257.png))**

&gt; To keep things honest, this doesn’t have a perfect track record, as, after the dot-com burst, GDP and earnings both turned higher well before stocks officially bottomed.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-chart-34.png))**

&gt; This in one of the more confusing concepts for many investors, but it is one that is so important to understand. Stocks will likely rise even as the news is bad, this is how it works. If you are waiting for things to officially improve, you likely will miss out on substantial gains along the way.

&gt; Burt White likes to say if you are playing a video game and you are going toward the monsters, you are going in the right direction. Investing is similar, as times will sometimes be extra scary, but this is part of the process. If you are scared or uncomfortable, that is all part of investing in a lot of ways and if you run the other way every time things get scary, you’ll likely never be able to meet your investment goals.

&gt; # Homebuilder Hopes Demolished

&gt; The national average on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage has come back below 7%, but it remains elevated versus recent history as housing data still can't catch a break. This morning, the NAHB released their latest reading on homebuilder sentiment and for the eleventh month in a row, the headline index fell month over month. As shown below, the current streak of nearly a year straight of declines is far and away a record, surpassing two eight-month long streaks leading up to the Financial Crisis.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-NAHB-1a.png))**

&gt; This month, homebuilder sentiment dropped another 5 points down to 33. That is not the largest drop of the current streak of declines, with bigger drops of 8 points last month or 12 points in July, but it still ranks in the bottom 4% of all months on record. In other words, not only is homebuilder sentiment falling consistently, but it's falling fairly fast. The other components have also seen bottom decile declines with the only sub-index avoiding declines being in the West.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-NAHB-2.png))**

&gt; After the November decline, the headline homebuilder sentiment reading sits 3 points above the spring 2020 low. Similarly, Present Sales and Traffic are down to the lowest level since April 2020 while Future Sales have actually surpassed those levels to now sit at the weakest reading in over a decade.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-NAHB-1.png))**

&gt; Last month, we highlighted how the geographic breakdown of sentiment was showing homebuilders in the Northeast being much more optimistic than their counter parts in the rest of the country. In November, that region joined the rest of the pack with a massive 17 point decline. That ranks as the third largest monthly decline on record behind a 19 point drop in June 2010 and the 45 point decline at the onset of the pandemic in April 2020. While that has not been enough to result in a new low, similar to sentiment in the Midwest, sentiment in the South is down to the lowest level in a decade. The same could be said for the West although it rose marginally month over month.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-NAHB-3.png))**

&gt; As for the reaction of homebuilder stocks, the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB) is trading 1.1% lower as of this writing. As shown below, after last week's equity market surge on CPI in which the group moved not only above its 50-DMA but also its 200-DMA, ITB has continued to hold above its moving averages for now. Without much follow through on the post-CPI surge, any move above last week's highs would be a welcome bullish sign, whereas the 200-DMA is looking to be the critical level of support for the time being.

# [Dow futures jump 200 points after strong Walmart earnings, inflation data ahead](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/14/stock-futures-rise-after-falling-monday-fading-last-weeks-rally.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Tuesday as traders looked ahead to the release of more key U.S. inflation data.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 206 points, or 0.6%. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures gained 1% and 1.5%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Walmart shares jumped in premarket trading after the company beat Wall Street earnings and revenue estimates and boosted full-year guidance. Home Depot reported strong results too but kept guidance in place for the full-year. Its shares dipped slightly.
*****
&gt; The producer price index, which measures wholesale inflation, is set for release at 8:30 a.m. ET. The report comes after the latest consumer price index data showed signs of inflationary pressure abating last month, thus sparking a sharp rally to end trading last week.
*****
&gt; “After last week’s CPI undershoot prompted a huge equity rally &amp; reversal in the Dollar, the critical topic for markets this week will be the Fed’s reaction,” wrote Huw Roberts, head of analytics at Quant Insight, in a Monday note.
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and Lael Brainard spoke Sunday and Monday, respectively, about the potential future path of monetary policy. Waller said the market was overly optimistic and should brace for higher rates, while Brainard said the central bank could ease off rate increases.
*****
&gt; Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, Fed Governor Lisa Cook and Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr are set to speak Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere, Taiwan Semiconductor, Louisiana-Pacific and Paramount jumped after regulatory filings showed that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway had bought new positions in the first two, and raised its stake in the last.
*****
&gt; Earnings season continues this week with retail reports from Target, Lowe’s, Bath and Body Works, Macy’s, Kohl’s and Foot Locker on deck.

2022-11-15 13:32:04,r/stocks,"Walmart raises outlook as groceries boost sales, inventory glut recedes","https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2022/11/15/walmart-wmt-earnings-q3-2023.html

Walmart said Tuesday that sales rose by nearly 9% in the fiscal third quarter, as Americans across income levels bought the company's low-priced groceries.

The discounter beat Wall Street's expectations for the quarter and raised its outlook to reflect that beat.

Here's what Walmart reported for the three-month period ended Oct. 31, according to Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $1.50 adjusted vs. $1.32 expected
Revenue: $152.81 billion vs. $147.75 billion expected
Walmart posted a net loss of $1.8 billion, or 66 cents per share, down from a profit of $3.11 billion, or $1.11 per share, a year earlier.

On an adjusted basis, the company reported earnings of $1.50 per share. The retailer recorded a charge of nearly $3.33 billion, or $1.05 a share, as part of an opioid settlement.

'Pocketbooks are stretched'

Shoppers are watching how they spend, Walmart Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said. They are buying less-expensive proteins such as hot dogs, beans and peanut butter instead of pricier meats. They are waiting for sales events to buy items like TVs and air fryers and are spending less in the apparel and home categories.

""Pocketbooks are stretched,"" he said. ""People have less discretionary income or less disposable income to spend on things — and so they're looking for value.""

The discounter also made progress with an industry-wide headache: a glut of excess inventory. Walmart's inventory was up 13% year over year in the third quarter. That's down from 25% in the second quarter and 32% in the first quarter.

Rainey said Walmart has canceled orders, increased markdowns and cleared through the backlog of merchandise stuck at ports. He said about 70% of the inventory increase is from inflation rather than more units.

""From a unit perspective, we find ourselves in a much, much better place than we did in the first part of the year,"" he said.

Comparable sales for Walmart U.S. rose 8.2%, excluding fuel. The key retail metric includes sales from Walmart stores and clubs open for the at least a year, including remodels, relocations and expansions.

Walmart is navigating a more challenging backdrop as it gears up for the holidays. Inflation is near a four-decade high, driving up the prices of housing, gas and more. Competitors are dangling deep discounts to try to clear through excess inventory. And consumers are spending again on travel, dining out and other experiences.

As inflation runs hot, however, the big-box retailer has attracted higher-income shoppers. About 75% of its market share gains in food came from households that make more than $100,000 a year, Rainey said. The discounter saw that same pattern in the previous quarter. 

So far, he said the holidays are ""off to a pretty solid start,"" but ""consumers are using discretion in terms of what they're buying.""",267,26,_hiddenscout,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yvvutc/walmart_raises_outlook_as_groceries_boost_sales/,yvvutc

2022-09-30 02:07:37,r/stocks,FCF Yield of Stocks I am Watching,"I recently compiled a list of stocks with their free cash flow (FCF) yield to see how good or bad that investment might be compared to a **2 year treasury bond (which is currently yielding \~4.2%)**. The yield was calculated using the enterprise value (EV) of the company since a lot of the companies carry a high debt load (think about AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Comcast for example). 

**Here is the equation for FCF yield of a company/stock that I used: FCF(ttm)/EV and FCF(5 yrs avg)/EV.** So basically I looked at the trailing 12 months (ttm) free cash flows and last 5 years average free cash flows as well. The data was taken from Yahoo Finance app and approximate. If you like any of the stocks based on their FCF yield, definitely do additional research to verify /cross check the numbers (some of the data might be inaccurate because of human error ).

*****
&gt; Stock futures fell Monday as worries over rising rates and tighter monetary policy added fuel to a rout that began in the previous session.
*****
&gt; Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 264 points, or about 0.8%. Those for the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 dropped 1% and 1.2%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Wall Street was suffered a sharp sell-off on Friday, when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s short and blunt remarks in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, appeared to extinguish hopes of the central bank changing its aggressive course of rate hikes in the months ahead.
*****
&gt; The Dow fell 1,008 points, or just over 3%, for its worst day since May. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell 3.4% and 3.9%, respectively, for their worst days since June. The drop erased the August gains for all three averages.
*****
&gt; “Investors again cut back on their recent Risk-On positioning, supporting our view that it is way too soon to call their recent risk appetite a more permanent stance, and now one more likely to have cost them badly,” Rick Bensignor of Bensignor Investment Strategies said in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile in Europe over the weekend, European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel warned that central banks must continue to fight inflation — even if it tips economies into recession.
*****
&gt; The coming week brings more Fed speeches, including Vice Chair Lael Brainard on Tuesday, before August’s nonfarm payrolls report on Friday.

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were little changed Tuesday as traders weighed the earnings reports from two key retailers.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down just 6 points, or 0.02%. S&amp;P 500 futures slipped 0.6% along with Nasdaq 100 futures.
*****
&gt; Walmart reported earnings per share that beat analyst expectations, sending the stock up 3%. The company also stuck with its second-half outlook. Home Depot reported earlier in the morning, with earnings beating expectations and the home-improvement store maintaining its 2022 guidance. Target and Lowe’s will report quarterly results Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere, shares of ZipRecruiter slipped more than 5% after the company lowered its revenue outlook.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a solid session, with the major averages all rising Monday after a sharp intraday turnaround. The move higher built on the market’s rally off a June low.
*****
&gt; Still, some see the recent gains as a bear market rally instead of the start of a new bull cycle.
*****
&gt; “I think people are not being sensitive enough to this economic slowdown and what it’s going to mean for corporate earnings and profit margins,” Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said on CNBC’s “Fast Money.”

Walmart Inc. WMT is cutting hundreds of corporate roles in a restructuring effort, according to people familiar with the matter, a week after the retail giant warned of falling profits.

2022-07-27 07:12:18,r/stocks,WMT and FOMC thoughts,"7.6% drop on WalMart today, off 10.04 for a gap of slightly under 10 points. Interestingly, this represents the second large down gap WMT has made since May. How long it will take to recover remains to be seen, but the point I’d like to bring up is that the bottom line of the news is that WMT is having to further discount prices because merchandise is not selling. 

If people are not shopping at their rollback mega-stores that dot the land, what does that say about American consumer confidence and the financial reserves of the typical WMT shopper? They’re apparently not shopping at AMZN, as they gapped down 5% today or Target, down 3.1%, also a gap.

Food banks across America are facing surging demands according to CNN. Is that a further indicator that the recession is already lapping at our heels? 

The CCI as reported today showed a drop in confidence of 2.7 points to 95.7. Still pretty high compared to a bit over 25% during the Great Recession, but by no means a positive economic number. Also, it’s the third consecutive drop in the CCI.

The silver lining? 

If inflationary pressures &gt; less shopping &gt; price cuts and price cuts = lower corporate profits, then the resulting reaction is deflationary pressure on the market. Oil, gas, lumber and housing prices are all dropping.

 If the Fed is less aggressive in tone tomorrow, they’ll be looking at data like this and the CCI drop today rather than signaling the next hike.

So, if the market reacts favorably to the FOMC news, then I expect WMT to have a bounce through Friday. If the market’s down, then the chart tea leaves I read suggest 117.75-ish as the next support.

Finally, those tea leaves I was just reading? Well, they were apparently laced with peyote, so no one should take any of my views with any seriousness. This is NFA.

2022-07-26 17:00:27,r/stocks,Tech Stocks Are Moving Back in Favor. 3 That Are Trying to Break Out.,"Technology stocks have been on a tear recently. Traders looking to catch the rally should look to the stocks that have just begun breaking out. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has gained almost 11% from its lowest close of the year in mid-June. That beats the S&amp;P 500’s roughly 8% gain since its mid-June low. Much of what is driving tech’s gains has been related to interest rates. Markets see a higher likelihood that inflation has peaked, and that the Federal Reserve will soon slow down the pace of interest-rate increases. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond has slipped since mid-June. Lower bond yields make future profits more valuable—and many fast-growing tech companies are valued on the basis that they’ll churn out a chunk of their profits many years in the future. 

**Netflix (NFLX)** is a good example. The stock is up about 31% from its June low. At $218 a share, it’s now above its 50-day moving average of $187. That signifies that market participants are now willing to buy the stock at levels above a longer-term trend. That signals increased confidence in the stock’s outlook. It’s not just lower bond yields juicing the stock. Netflix’s earnings last week revealed fewer subscriber losses than analysts had anticipated, while management said it expects subscriber growth in the current quarter. Analysts are also predicting the company will rely less on upping its spending to accrue new subscribers and grow revenue, which will allow profit margins to expand. Earnings per share are expected to compound at annual rate of about 15% for the next three years, according to FactSet. 

**Spotify (SPOT)** is another example of a tech stock that is starting to break out. It has climbed about 20% from its 2022 low hit in mid-May. At $108, it’s above its 50-day moving average of about $105. Plus, buyers have frequently stepped in this year in the low-$90 area, to bring the stock upward. John Kolovos, chief technical strategist at Macro Risk Advisors, wrote that the stock could have easily hit a “double bottom” in the low-$90 area. Spotify’s earnings are due out Wednesday. That will be a key catalyst keeping the stock trading at healthy levels, or it could send the price tumbling again. 

**Amazon.com** **(AMZN)** stock is also looking better. It has jumped about18% from its June bottom and, at $121, it is above its 50-day moving average of $113. A “bullish breakout” is in play if the stock can continue upward, Kolovos wrote.  Earnings for the e-commerce giant are coming Thursday. This all may sound rosy, but there is plenty ahead that could complicate tech stocks’ upward trajectory. Tuesday’s trading is evidence of that: The Nasdaq slid more than 1% after Walmart’s (WMT\_ earnings warning dented broader market sentiment. In addition, many tech companies report earnings in the next few weeks, and the Fed’s next interest-rate decision on Wednesday will be key for both the bond and stock markets. Meanwhile, all three of these tech stocks are still trading below their 200-day moving averages. In order for anyone to become even more bullish on these names, surpassing those levels will be key.

# [Stock futures fall after Walmart cuts forecast, says inflation hit consumer spending](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/25/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell on Tuesday morning after Walmart cut its profit forecast, sending retail stocks tumbling in the premarket.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 141 points, or 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 futures lost 0.4% also and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 0.5%.
*****
&gt; A late Monday announcement from Walmart, which cut its quarterly and full-year profit estimates because of rising food inflation, alarmed investors who deliberated the implications for other retail stocks. The big-box retailer said higher prices are spurring consumers to pull back on general merchandise spending, particularly in apparel.
*****
&gt; Walmart plunged 9% in early morning trading and dragged other retailers with it. Target dropped 5.2%, and Amazon fell 3.7%. Kohl’s and Dollar General lost 4.5% and 3.6%, respectively, while Costco shed 3.1%.
*****
&gt; “Clearly, they have the wrong stuff, and they have to sell it more aggressively to clear that out, which looks like it’s going to take a pretty dramatic hit as a result of that,” Jeremy Bryan, senior portfolio manager at Gradient Investments, said during CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
&gt; “The question is, how does this relate to the rest of the discretionary space?” Bryan added.
*****
&gt; General Motors fell 3.6% in premarket trading after the company missed earnings estimates, citing supply chain disruptions stemming from Russia’s war on Ukraine and global Covid lockdowns.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere, Coca-Cola shares rose 1.3% premarket after the topped earnings and revenue expectations, citing recovering sales volume that dropped in the pandemic and higher pricing.
*****
&gt; Shares of McDonald’s eked traded just above the flat line in early trading following mixed second-quarter results, in which net sales were hurt in part by the closure of locations in Russia and Ukraine, but international growth elsewhere fueled a rise same-store sales.
*****
&gt; General Electric, UPS and 3M also reported strong quarterly earnings Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Traders are bracing for an onslaught of mega-cap tech earnings and economic data this week, as well as the outcome of the Federal Reserve meeting, that will help Wall Street direct its expectations for the rest of the year.
*****
&gt; “I think that there’s going to be a bifurcated market,” VantageRock Capital’s Avery Sheffield said during CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” “I think the bottom might be in certain stocks, but nowhere in others. So this actually could be one of the most dynamic earnings seasons we’ve seen in a long time.”
*****
&gt; Stocks traded in a narrow range during Monday’s session, with the S&amp;P 500 adding 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 90.75 points, or 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lagged, sliding 0.4%. All of the major averages are on track for their best month of the year.
*****
&gt; On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve will commence its two-day policy meeting. Traders are widely expecting a three-quarter percentage point hike.
*****
&gt; On the economic front, investors are expecting the latest reading of the Case-Shiller Home Price Index at 9 a.m. ET. The consumer confidence report and new home sales data are due out at 10 a.m. ET.

&gt; **Walmart (WMT)** – Walmart slumped 9.5% in the premarket after cutting its outlook for the current quarter and full year.

# [Stock futures fall as growth concerns linger, dollar surges](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/11/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday as worries over global economic growth dented investor appetite for risk assets. Wall Street also looked ahead to the start of what could be a difficult earnings season.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slipped by 221 points, or 0.71%. S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.43% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.07%.
*****
&gt; Investors appeared to be shunning riskier assets such as stocks in favor of traditional safe havens such as U.S. Treasurys and the dollar. The 10-year Treasury yield fell 7 basis points to 2.92%.
*****
&gt; The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency’s performance against six other currencies, popped 0.5% to 108.51. That gain put the euro on the brink of parity with the dollar, as recession fears grow in Europe.
*****
&gt; The dollar index has been on fire this year, rising 13% in that time. Several Wall Street strategists have warned that this strength in the U.S. currency could spell trouble for corporate earnings ahead.
*****
&gt; “The surging USD is a symptom of global unease and will make life even more difficult for Corporate America (the EPS headwind from FX is going to be enormous) and int’l central banks (as the slumping EUR, GBP, etc., adds to the inflationary pressures in the EU and UK),” wrote Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge.
*****
&gt; PepsiCo kicked off the corporate earnings season Tuesday morning, with the snacks and beverages giant reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue. The company also raised its revenue outlook for the year. Delta Air Lines and JPMorgan Chase are among the companies slated to report later this week.
*****
&gt; Market participants will watch for downside risk to earnings forecasts as companies grapple with rising interest rates and greater inflationary pressures, and as Wall Street debates the likelihood of a recession.
*****
&gt; “In terms of S&amp;P earnings, for instance, we think we’re already moving towards an earnings recession,” Marathon Asset Management’s Bruce Richards said Monday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
&gt; “Companies are getting squeezed at all sides, they’re getting squeezed on cost of goods and the wages and all things that go into input from our manufacturing goals or services. And on the other end, we think revenues are starting to flatten before turning down at a time when interest cost is going up. ...That’s a lot of downgrades, a lot of potential defaults coming from the system as a result of higher charges.”
*****
&gt; Inflation is also on investors’ radars this week with June’s consumer price index report set for release Wednesday. The headline inflation number, including food and energy, is expected to rise to 8.8% from May’s level of 8.6%, according to estimates from Dow Jones.
*****
&gt; Wall Street was coming off a downbeat session in which the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq all fell.

2022-05-26 17:21:57,r/stocks,"Near-term bottom forming in health insurance, pharmaceuticals, financials, basic materials/commodities, telecommunications services, industrials &amp; consumer cyclicals","We're now into 5 days of gains for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. A possible near-term bottom is forming in health insurance, pharmaceuticals, financials, basic materials/commodities, telecommunications services, industrials &amp; consumer cyclicals, with the strongest gains in high cashflow, dividend paying stocks in those sectors. 

Tech continues to drag; however, the lifting effect of value stocks &amp; undervalued sectors are lifting selected names in tech/growth. 

In consumer defensive/retail, only select names are rallying (DG, DGTR, JWM, M) while select names have tumbled (WMT, TGT) depending on earnings reports. 

A short to intermediate bull market in energy &amp; related stocks, travel, and beverage stocks continues.

___________________

**Are we in a ""rally"" and is the ""bear market"" over?**

Financial reporters have been alternatively using the terms ""rally"" and ""bear market rally"" while analysts also claim that we're not near a market bottom yet. 

My personal take on the market this week is that there are sectors and names in the market that have bottomed and are gaining/regaining value while tech/growth stocks are continuing to sink. My most bullish view is that while tech/growth stocks may see a short bear market rally in June, and then resume falling, some of the rest of the market may be starting to bottom, particularly the value stocks/sectors and the high cashflow companies within all sectors. While the rest of the market may resume falling after a brief early Summer rally, stocks that are not tech/growth may never fall into bear territory and some may even rise out of correction territory. Overall, I think most of the sectors in the stock market are still giving the best results to stock pickers. 

There are far too many geopolitical moving parts &amp; unpredictable market forces ongoing as the pandemic economy unwinds, to predict whether a bottom is in (even for a subset of the market) or whether this is a ""rally"" or ""bear market rally"". Many of the unpredictable, independent factors have enough impact to move the dial at any time.

________________________________

**My personal takes**

I personally feel that it's unproductive for me to focus wholly on broad market indexes. 

It seems clear that part of the market are in a definite bear market and have more to fall while some sectors of the market, like some industrial specialties, energy &amp; commodities, are in a long term bull cycle. 

Other sectors have been falling but seem to be finding some footing lately. 

For some people who have been able to avoid the overvalued stocks, this has not only not been a bear market, but not even a market in correction. Because of the footprint of the overvalued tech/growth/mega caps, the volatility of those stocks of course will drag down the entire market at times, but this is not necessarily a bad thing. 

This is a good time to talk about rotations. What is happening is that excess capital in some overvalued stocks are leaving those stocks/sectors and flowing into others. When that happens, that's called ""sector rotation"" if the money is leaving one sector and flowing into another, or ""rotation from growth to value"" as money leaves growth stocks that had been pumped up too much by low interest rates and flows into stocks that pay dividends and have good cashflow/fundamentals. If your eye is only on broad market indexes or one sector, you may be missing all the rotation-type action. 

Why are dividends the new favored stocks? When there's high inflation &amp; rising interest rates, real cash money in your hand today is worth more than the promise of future money that you will get a year, two years, or farther down the road. Dividend stocks pay you cash made by their businesses at regular intervals. Growth stocks, on the other hand, represent a promise of future money at some later time. The more inflation and/or interest rates rise, the more cash-money today is worth versus promises of future money that you'll see later on down the road. 

I feel think that it's still a stock picker's market and that there's an overall long term downtrend for the broad market indexes.   

There are a lot of risks and downsides in the market environment today &amp; none of this is advice that anyone who is not actively interested in following markets &amp; stocks should invest at this time.

2022-05-25 00:25:50,r/stocks,The South Park Investing Strategy,"**Intro**

Greetings you filthy animals! In light of the collapsing market I've been looking for investing strategies that still work (like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/uw86l4/this_is_actually_beating_the_sp_500_this_year/)). This is another one of them!

**The Question**

Could a portfolio that invests in stocks when they're mentioned on South Park actually be a viable investment strategy?

**The Data**

I originally used the South Park Fandom site to brute force scrape every episode script in search of company names listed in the NYSE/NASDAQ database. This picked up a lot of shit and even missed a few obvious ones, like a mention of Campbells Soup in the 2015 episode Red Man's Greed. I needed a different way to get all the data. I hit the jackpot on Wikipedia when I found they have a summary of every episode, complete with a list of references made. I wrote a script to pull the ticker symbols associated with the company names, along with each episode air date. We were in business.

**The Strategy**

Being mentioned in the episode was our buy signal, so we just needed to test the right time to sell. I played around with a few investment windows - 30 days, 60, 120, 360 - but nothing looked all that impressive. I decided to try a more aggressive approach, completely selling previous holdings as soon as the next company mention occurred. This makes us entirely beholden to South Park as our stock picker, which for some reason is what we want...

**The Results**

Um....

South Park. Fucking. Destroys. Of course it does because nothing makes sense. Our South Park strategy returned 1100% over the past 7 years, compared to 200% for the S&amp;P 500. This boils down to a 50% CAGR over the past 7 years with a Sharpe ratio of about 1.4. Not too bad. Now, keep in mind that this strategy basically boiled down to ""buy Build a Bear and $VIAC during the pandemic."" But gains are gains and this strategy fucking worked. So cheers WSB, you're 2 for 2 on meme strats!

**Conclusion**

Idk man... I guess just go with what you feel? If this works then who am I or anyone else to tell you a strategy is dumb. If you put a bunch of time in and do your DD you'll probably lose money. If you think your bowl of Cheerios is telling you to buy Realty Income Corp (look it up) then it'll probably be a winner. Up is down, and Cartman should be hosting Mad Money (which I think he did once, right?). I got inspired to try this strategy by the data-driven investing strategies like on [Quantbase](https://www.getquantbase.com) and this this could be a sweet one to try (they might even have it).

So what other commonly-agreed high conviction bring-it-to-grave stocks that can be used as the low tide markers? I will list the FAANG first and will add more if you can let me know stocks in other sectors, like TGT and WMT? JPM?

EDIT: To clarify my question, I'm asking about high-conviction stocks now, in this period, your period. Let's say if you own AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, MCD, KO and SPY, which will be the last stock to sell if you have experienced financial hardship (I don't wish this to anyone!)?

UPDATE: I'll keep adding mentioned tickers. There are few stocks still holding strong (less than 15% discount), such as WM, KO, ABBV and MCD. Perhaps when these 10%er move into 20%er, the final heirlooms are pawned.

2022-05-13 02:27:12,r/stocks,A simple South Park index fund beats the S&amp;P (not a total meme),"# Intro

I'm aware of how WallStreetBets-y this post sounds, and to be fair I did post something similar there [earlier today](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uo246c/ask_and_you_shall_receive_the_south_park/). But bear with me - I tried to be more sober with this analysis.

I made [this Inverse Cramer Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uiipwu/this_is_actually_beating_the_sp_by_over_30_for/), which is beating the S&amp;P by \*20% YTD - I also made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ujt0lx/i_built_the_inverse_cramer_index_what_should_i_do/) asking folks what I should do next, and the highest upvoted comment was a portfolio that invested in stocks based on South Park mentions. So I built it.

# The Question

Is a portfolio that invests in stocks when South Park mentions them a viable investment strategy?

# The Data

I originally used the South Park Fandom site to try and brute force scrape every episode script and compare to every company name in the NYSE/NASDAQ database. This picked up a lot of shit though (and it also didn't pick up a lot of stuff that it should have, like a mention of Campbell's Soup in the 2015 episode Red Man's Greed), so had to figure out a different way to get all that data. I got creative - found out that Wikipedia has a summary for every episode, and links to the company names, so I built out a script that pulled tickers by scraping for these company names.

# The Strategy

I tried a bunch of things. Because the signals we get from the show are only buy signals, we have to create the sell signals ourselves based on some sort of unbiased metric. First, I tried making a few investment windows, aka selling all buy picks after x days since the last buy mention - I tried with 30 days, 60 days, 120 days, and 360 days.

Most investment windows were on par or slightly outperformed the S&amp;P. The iteration that worked best was selling completely once the next episode mention occurs, so that you're always fully invested in the most recent episode's picks. This ends up exposing you pretty strongly to South Park as a stockpicker aka signal producer, which I guess is exactly what you want. If I were doing this in an actual portfolio like the Inverse Cramer, I'd do the investment windows, albeit maybe a larger window, greater than 365 days, just because of tax reasons.

# The Performance

[https://i.imgur.com/waNPQAp.png](https://i.imgur.com/waNPQAp.png)

South Park destroys. Not what I was expecting at all. An increase of about 1100% over 7 years (including the recent downturn), compared to close to 200% for SPY and 300% for QQQ. This bakes in about a 50% CAGR for the past 7 years, with a Sharpe of about 1.4. Keep in mind, though, that this seems to essentially be a ""buy $BBW and $VIAC during the pandemic"" strategy that causes this much outperformance - otherwise, the results would likely be only a few percentage points of outperformance, based on the South Park picks beating, but essentially tracking the other indexes.

# Discussion/Conclusion

No fucking clue lmao - I would never invest based on South Park data. Maybe that's why I'm poor though. On a more serious note, the way many hedge funds get their supposed ""edge"" is by paying a lot of money for alternative datasets like this. Some others that I've heard of are parking lot fill data, company mentions on Instagram posts weighted by follower count, and I'd definitely assume WallStreetBets sentiment analysis tracking. **Any other alternative datasets you've been curious about?**",255,35,SchemeElectronic9058,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/uofcca/a_simple_south_park_index_fund_beats_the_sp_not_a/,uofcca
2022-05-11 12:16:50,r/stocks,Selling Individual stocks at a gain and reinvesting in the S&amp;P 500 right now?,"Hello all. I have a few stocks that have weathered the current downturn pretty well.

LLY, UNH, KO, SYY, MCD, WMT, COST. Roughly around 35k all together.  I am up between 4-25+ % all time of these buys. 

My question is: Would it make sense to sell these stocks at a gain, and put the money directly in an ETF  that mirrors the total market or S&amp;P 500 like VOO or VTI, given that these funds are down roughly 18% and will (unless the American economy fails) eventually recover. I am 24 years old and do not need this money anytime soon. Some would be sold at short term cap gains, but I assume my overall portfolio will be negative anyways by the end of 2022 for tax purposes.",60,19,maccyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/un6kvk/selling_individual_stocks_at_a_gain_and/,un6kvk
2022-05-10 03:50:52,r/stocks,There isn't any purpose to being in the market this year or next!,"Ok guys I've been thinking tonight again!

I've come to the conclusion after many hours of pondering the subject that .... There is absolutely NO PURPOSE to being in the market at very least 2022 and most likely 2023!

I just can't see any of this getting better any time soon!

Tomorrow I will increase my SQQQ position size and the only stocks I will hold will be a few oil and maybe WMT! At least till 2024 or so!

I am going to cut my losses and get out while I'm ahead from my first 2.4 years investing! Yes, I'm still up a measly 18% for 2.4 years, but it's better than being 0 or less as we go down further.

I believe we may have a relief rally soon but in my opinion in won't amount to much. Maybe 1 or 2% portfolio up.

Then I'll exit to maybe 60% cash at least.

I hate to say this but I had a vision last night of the market getting down to about 2000 or so and not recovering till maybe 2024.

What I'll do is buy back in a little here and there at about 3000 or less on sp500.

I feel we should all be very careful now and preserve as much cash as possible.  All my new savings have been going directly to money market and is not entering the market. There is no point. All miney that enters now will just get gobbled up as we fall.

That's just my opinion, but on a serious note I just don't see ANY good in markets this year.

If you do please enlighten me. I just don't see it, but I am only a layman.

So my brothers, please be very careful. The only stocks I'll purchase after we hit 3000 or less will be things like MSFT AAPL GOOGL and maybe NVDA mostly.

Also I believe in UNH TMO SHW and HD.

I will also be purchasing some VTI once we hit 3000 or so as I believe that is a good entry point.

Stay safe all and remember that in a couple years I have hope that things will eventually get better if even only slightly.

Use this oppurtunity to purchase our equities at a large discount! But in my opinion right now is TOO SOON! The market has more purging to do!.... A lot more!

Peace and keep the faith! Things will get better some day!",0,0,apooroldinvestor,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/um78wa/there_isnt_any_purpose_to_being_in_the_market/,um78wa

2022-04-15 19:57:37,r/stocks,"Thoughts on the long-term growth of AMZN, ADBE, and CRM","Follow-up to my MSFT/GOOGL/NVDA post earlier this week (resolution there was to keep all three but perhaps trim them some).  **This is part two, but will likely be the last such post for a while as I do not intend to bombard you with these types of posts (I know they might get annoying) but do value your feedback.**

What are your thoughts on the long-term growth of AMZN, ADBE, and CRM?  By long-term I mean for the next 5-10 years, and taking into consideration various scenarios like stagflation, recessions, or on the flip side, an economic boom if Powell can figure out inflation and Putin loses his war quickly.

My preliminary thoughts:

* AMZN: Overall, I see it as a good stock with a weakening moat.  AWS is their crown jewel and will likely remain so, but they are facing increasing competition from MSFT, GOOGL and others (e.g. ORCL, IBM, but these are to a much lesser extent).  E-Commerce appears to be slower growth especially given the immense costs of capex (delivery, warehouses).  E-Commerce is facing increasing competition from others like TGT, WMT, and SHOP, and the first two of these are already big box stores and thus do not need to spend as much on capex to ramp up.  For example, TGT/WMT offer buy and pick up services, which while not as convenient as AMZN prime, is still pretty useful (I use it sometimes).  Bottom line, I fear AMZN's growth will be slower going forward, which does not bode well as its PE is also quite a bit higher than MSFT and GOOGL.

* ADBE: Its software is ubiquitous, but seems to have stalled out on growth.  My favorite segment of theirs is actually the Experience Cloud, which appears unique but is having inconsistent results.  Document Cloud faces heavy competition from Docusign, etc. and anyway is free for most users (Adobe Acrobat Reader) or already installed (meaning incremental revenue would have to come from fee increases and not necessarily new licenses).  Creative Cloud remains good, but it is mostly focused on 2D AFAIK.  If 3D imaging continues to gain steam, I see ADSK and U being better.  Bottom line and as with AMZN, competition and over-saturation are issues.

* CRM: It appears quite clear that its sales platform is saturated, and it appears that even Marc Benioff knows that (hence the Tableau and Slack acquisitions).  I see the Analytics Cloud as being potentially the biggest gamechanger of theirs as Tableau's competitors are rather weak and smaller companies (e.g. Alteryx).  I have heard that Microsoft has a competing product called PowerBI, but I don't know exactly how it stacks up to Tableau.  Not sure though if the Analytics Cloud will be enough to take CRM to significantly higher growth (e.g. 20%+ revenue growth yoy).",23,4,tinyraccoon,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u4dsoz/thoughts_on_the_longterm_growth_of_amzn_adbe_and/,u4dsoz
2022-03-13 19:27:38,r/stocks,Investing in companies with wide moats,"The term ""**economic moat**"" was coined by Warren Buffett.

Think about a castle that is surrounded by a deep trench, a moat, filled with water. The moat acts to protect the castle from invaders, and the bigger the moat, the less of a chance attackers have of getting across the moat!

Moats, in the context of investing, allows a company to outearn and fend off its competitors for as long as the moat is intact. Just like a castle, the wider and deeper these moats are, the harder it is for competitors to replicate, the less of a chance they have of seizing market share.

Moat investing is based on a simple concept:

**Invest in companies with sustainable competitive advantages trading at attractive valuations**.

One of the first steps in implementing this approach is finding companies with a moat. A company’s moat refers to its ability to maintain the competitive advantages that are expected to help it fend off competition and maintain profitability into the future.

# Moat archetypes

While Moats come in different shapes and sizes, they can be categorized into **five distinct archetypes** (you can find a more comprehensive explanation with examples in this [VanEck Report](https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/morningstar-wide-moat-etf-moat/what-makes-a-moat-white-paper.pdf/)).

1. **Intangible assets** (e.g. SBUX) -  Patents, brands, regulatory licenses and other intangible assets can prevent competitors from duplicating a company’s products, or can allow the company to charge a significant price premium
2. **Network effects** (e.g. GOOG, MSFT, V) - As more people use a company’s product or service, the value of that product or service increases for both new and existing users
3. **Switching cost** (e.g. CRM) -  When it would be too expensive or troublesome to switch away from a company’s products, that company often enjoys pricing power
4. **Low-cost producer** (e.g. WMT) -  Firms with a structural cost advantage can either undercut competitors on price while earning similar margins, or can charge market-level prices while earning relatively high margins
5. **Natural monopolies** \-  (e.g. D) When a company serves a market limited in size, new competitors may not have an incentive to enter. Incumbents generate economic profits, but new entrants would cause returns for all players to fall to a level in line with or below the cost of capital

# Key Takeaways:

* A company is a good investment if they **earn and can continue to earn more than what they’re selling for**. The greater the earnings are compared to the price, the better the investment.
* A moat is a distinct and structural advantage a company has that is difficult to replicate and are what allows a company to earn lots of money. **The stronger the moat, the more money it earns**.
* The **longer you hold a company** with a strong moat, the **better your return on investment will be**.
* Identifying a moat is not rocket science — **understand how the company makes money**, **figure out why consumers prefer their products over their competitors**, and cross-reference your hypothesis with a few key numbers.
* Owner's earnings growth is a good and reliable way to identify if a company has moat. **The wider the moat, the more owner's earnings will grow**.

Interested to hear examples of companies with wide moats in each of these archetypes, so feel free to share in the comments.",71,15,SkittleznTiddiez,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tdd2ma/investing_in_companies_with_wide_moats/,tdd2ma

SMG is near 52-week lows. they have a PE of 18.6 which isn't amazing and isn't horrid. They do pedestrian stuff and have a wide reach. The dividend isn't amazing, but it's not horrid.

# **The Federal Reserve’s rate debate and Ukraine tensions could jolt markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/11/fed-rate-debate-ukraine-tensions-could-jolt-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks are likely to be volatile in the week ahead as investors watch tensions between Russia and Ukraine and debate how quickly the Federal Reserve can raise interest rates.
*****
&gt; Markets were roiled in the past week and bond yields spiked after a hot inflation reading Thursday upended many Wall Street forecasts for interest rate hikes. Investors were dealt another blow Friday after the White House warned that Russia could invade Ukraine during the Olympics. Both the U.S. and U.K. have called for their citizens to leave Ukraine as soon as possible.
*****
&gt; “I think the Fed is keeping everyone on edge, and this is going to add to that edginess,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “So we had a three-week earnings respite from the macro. We turned micro, and this week we were reminded earnings season is pretty much over and all macro issues matter again.”
*****
&gt; The major averages slid sharply on Friday afternoon, and Treasury yields came off the highs they set after Thursday’s report that January’s consumer price index jumped by 7.5%, a 40-year high. The S&amp;P 500 lost 1.8% for the week, falling to 4,418.
*****
&gt; With about two hours left to Friday trading, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told a White House briefing that there were signs of Russian escalation at the Ukraine border. Sullivan said it was possible an invasion could occur during the Olympics, despite speculation to the contrary.
*****
&gt; “Up until now, I’d say it was all about monetary policy. This throws an extra unknown into the works,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. “The dollar is rallying, oil prices have rallied and stocks are selling off... Even if nothing happens this weekend, people will be nervous about it in the next week.”
*****
&gt; Boockvar said the Russian tensions complicate the central bank’s outlook, and an invasion would add to already hot global inflation. “It’s causing problems for the Fed because this basically would inflate oil prices, food prices, wheat, fertilizers and everything else and just make the Fed’s inflation fighting capability that much more difficult to maneuver,” he said. “The Fed can’t back off. You can’t blame geopolitics as a reason not to hike rates.”
*****
&gt; He said if the central bank were concerned about an economic impact, it could slow hikes.
*****
&gt; # Fed’s inflation fight
&gt; By Friday morning, some economists had ratcheted up expectations for the Fed to hike interest rates by a half point in March, following the January inflation report. Others, like economists at Goldman Sachs, have raised their views to a faster pace, with as many as seven quarter-point hikes for this year.
*****
&gt; Fed speakers will be a highlight in the week ahead, particularly St. Louis Fed President James Bullard who appears on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Monday at 8:30 a.m. Bullard added to market turbulence and the sharp jump in bond yields Thursday when he said that he would like to see rates rise by 100 basis points (or 1 percentage point) by July.
*****
&gt; “I think volatility remains elevated as we transition from essentially this more dovish Fed to this more hawkish Fed policy which we’re experiencing,” said Patrick Palfrey, senior equity strategist at Credit Suisse. “We haven’t yet settled on how hawkish we are going to be and until we can chart a new path for interest rates hikes with some consistency, I think volatility is going to remain elevated, and that’s going to be more true for high valuation companies.”
*****
&gt; # What to watch
&gt; The Federal Reserve releases minutes from its last meeting on Wednesday. Investors will watch it carefully for any new insights on its plans for rate hikes, the inflation outlook or comments on its balance sheet.
*****
&gt; There will also be more important inflation data, when the producer price index is reported Tuesday. That report is also expected to be very hot, after January’s CPI. Surging inflation has caused consumer sentiment to slump, and now economists are watching consumer spending closely. That means January’s retail sales will also be important when it is reported Wednesday.
*****
&gt; There is also a final rush of big earnings reports, with Cisco, Nvidia and AIG Wednesday. Walmart reports Thursday, and Deere reports Friday.
*****
&gt; “We’re starting to transition beyond earnings, I think investors took a fair amount of comfort that profit margins stayed as high as they did,” said Palfrey. “I think the question is as we look out at the next couple of quarters, are we able to pass through prices at the same rate?”
*****
&gt; # Fed debate
&gt; Palfrey said investors are looking for more clear communications from the central bank. Bullard is the only Fed official who endorsed a 50-basis-point hike, while others, like Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said she does not expect to raise the fed funds target rate by more than a quarter point. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has left the door open to a half point hike but did not say he favored it.
*****
&gt; Fed Governor Lael Brainard speaks Friday, as does Fed Governor Christopher Waller. Mester speaks Thursday.
*****
&gt; Other Fed officials have pushed back on Bullard’s comments. But still, there is a high level of uncertainty in the market, and bond pros are wondering if the St. Louis Fed chief will walk back his comments Monday morning.
*****
&gt; Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said some investors wonder if market volatility could slow the central bank’s tightening path.
*****
&gt; “The Fed is full steam ahead. They have to be... They’re still adding to the balance sheet. We’re still at zero on rates,” she said. “There’s nothing in my mind, unless an asteroid lands on earth and blows us all to smithereens, that makes the Fed say we’re fine, we’re going to stay at zero.”
*****
&gt; “They’re admitting themselves they’re behind the curve. They let the inflation cat out of the bag. I don’t think they thought it would have the traction it has had,” she said.
*****
&gt; # Rate rally and reverse
When bonds sell off, yields go higher and they jumped this past week. The 10-year yield was as high as 2.06% Friday. After the Ukraine news, the 10-year yield was back down to about 1.93%.
*****
&gt; The 2-year yield was at a high of 1.63% Friday, up from 1.32% the week earlier. The biggest moves were Thursday, and the yield on the 2-year note moved more than 20 basis points Thursday. But by Friday afternoon, it had fallen back to 1.51%.

&gt; # First Trading Day of February Monthly Options Expiration Week DJIA Down 9 of Last 17

&gt; In addition to being Valentine’s Day, next Monday is also the first trading day of February’s monthly option expiration week. Traders looking to roll or exit positions may begin first thing next week. Since 1990, Monday or the first trading day of the week has a bullish record. S&amp;P 500 has enjoyed the greatest frequency of gains, up 23 times in 32 years with an average gain of 0.26% on Monday. Russell 2000 is second best since 1990 with 21 gains. However, since 2005 the day has seen less bullishness with DJIA down 9 of the last 17 and its average performance slipping to just 0.09%. S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have held up better over the last 17 years when compared to DJIA.

&gt; # Super Bowl Indicator

&gt; Americans across the country are gearing up for Super Bowl LVI this Sunday. The Rams are currently a four-point favorite, and the Bengals could struggle to contain the league's best defensive line. Both teams come into this game with their respective offenses on fire, and the last few weeks of the playoffs have resulted in nail-biting finishes.

&gt; One outlandish market theory suggests that when the NFC wins the Super Bowl the market will perform better than average. Conversely, when the AFC wins, the market underperforms. Although there is no basis of truth to justify these claims, the conclusion has historically been accurate. As you can see from the table below, the S&amp;P 500 averages a gain of 10.3% from the Super Bowl through year-end when the NFC takes home the Lombardi trophy. On the other hand, when the AFC wins the Super Bowl, the S&amp;P 500 averages a gain of 6.2%, which is 4.1 percentage points lower. The positivity rates have slightly favored an NFC victory as well (78.6% vs 70.4%).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/02/021122-AFC-NFC.png))**

&gt; Neither the Rams nor the Bengals have won multiple Super Bowls. The Rams have won just once (in 2000), and this is the Bengals third time competing in the Super Bowl. Of the teams that have won multiple Super Bowls, the S&amp;P 500 has performed best through year-end when the Steelers, 49ers, Broncos, or Bucs take home the trophy. After the Dolphins, Raiders, and Giants won Super Bowls, forward returns were negative on an average basis.

&gt; Given that the one Super Bowl the Rams won was in 2000, you would think that the last thing a bull would want to see on Sunday is a win by Matt Stafford and crew. On the other hand, in the two prior Super Bowls that the Bengals played in and lost, the S&amp;P 500 was up over 20% for the remainder of the year both times, so it's a bit of a push. Within the Bespoke crew, the Bengals are a near but not unanimous pick, Who has heads on the coin toss?

***** 

&gt; # Do Stocks Want The Bengals or Rams to Win?

&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks fall. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but “data don’t lie”: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 55 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won.

&gt; It was originally discovered in 1978 by Leonard Kopett, a sportswriter for the New York Times. Up until that point, the indicator had never been wrong.

&gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl Indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC—and ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.8% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 7.1% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 65% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.9.22-Blog-Chart-1.png))**

&gt; So should the bulls be rooting for the Rams? Maybe not. Stocks have actually done just fine lately when the AFC has won. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 Index gained 10 of the past 11 years after an AFC Super Bowl champ.

&gt; “Interestingly, there have been 55 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Of course, we’d never suggest investing based on this, but history would say that lately AFC teams have been quite good for stocks, but I’m also a Bengals fan, so I’m clearly biased.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.9.22-Blog-Chart-2.png))**

&gt; Here’s a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories. The author’s favorite team, The Cincinnati Bengals, isn’t on this list just yet. Hopefully that changes this time next week.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.9.22-Blog-Chart-3.png))**

&gt; Lastly, Tom Brady won’t be in this Super Bowl and won’t be in any more now that he has retired. He played in a record 10 Super Bowls and won a record 7 of them. Maybe something he should be known for is the Brady Indicator, as when he won the big game stocks did well and when he lost, they didn’t.

Retirement, education, growth, play money etc. Would like to know what buckets do you have, what do you hold in them and why you sequestered your money in that way? Also looking for input/comments on my allocation. My buckets are as follows:  


Retirement fund: Cash account. 25% of my money. About 10 ETFs (QQQ, VOO, DIA, BND, ARKK, DRIV, XIT, XIU. Not in any order). Horizon is 20+ years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Education fund for dependents: Cash account. 12% of my money. 3 ETFs (QQQ, VOO, DIA). Horizon is 10 years. Just created this portfolio.

&amp;#x200B;

Tax free account: Cash account.14% of my money. About 10 ETFs (QQQ, SPY, DIA, BND, ARKK, SOXX, WCLD, XRE, DRIV, XIT, XIU, XQQ). Quite similar to the retirement account. Horizon is 1-2 years

&amp;#x200B;

Growth fund: Margin account. 52% of my money. High risk. Very concentrated (MSFT, APPL, WMT, LYFT, CRM, TSLA). Horizon is 5 years. I want to reduce my money in this account but I am deep in red.

2021-12-31 20:16:04,r/stocks,A message to all of you who earned less than 30% this year,"Over the past couple weeks, there have been a number high-horse posts on this sub directed at people who underperformed the S&amp;P 500 index this year. 

I am here to tell you this: You might have done everything right and still fallen short of the S&amp;P. That isn't inherently bad nor is it inherently a sign of failure. Lots of great companies' stocks had a bum year (AMZN, V, WMT, DIS, BA, MRK) and some got clobbered (PYPL, telecos, etc.) 

Despite popular opinion, investing in individual stocks is not about beating the indexes over an arbitrary short-term period of time. It's about owning shares of strong companies regardless of what the market is doing. Stocks like V and DIS could very feasibly beat the market significantly next year, and may be better positioned to do so if they're seen as a good value. 

Meanwhile, many posts and comments on here suggest getting out of every stock immediately (and worse, selling while they're down), and that you're foolish for even trying. This is not helpful advice. This advice is only helpful if you're the kind of person whose portfolio is 100% meme stocks with no earnings and you have no desire to learn anything new or improve your understanding of stocks or companies whatsoever. If this is you, then yes, you should listen to VTI or VT gang. 

But, I suspect this is not most people here. I suspect this is a tired stereotype, and that a large number of people reading this understand the fundamentals of their holdings quite well but still underperformed this year. Big deal. If you're a buy and hold investor, this isn't a problem unless there's really something wrong with the companies. We all know stocks are more volatile than index funds. 

There are lots of other reasons why someone might not be enjoying this 28% ride: Maybe they didn't have much invested at the beginning of the year. Maybe they're actively learning and making adjustments along the way. Maybe their net worth *is* mostly in index funds and they just want to play jazz with their stock portfolio. Maybe they're in VT and bonds, which is arguably more responsible, and had a far lower return than the S&amp;P. 

I have learned an incredible amount about stocks this year thanks to this sub and websites like Investopedia, FinViz, OpenInsider, and others, and it has given me much enjoyment to participate in the markets in this way. Posts and comments that demean underperforming stock pickers essentially discourage learning. 

One last point: There is an ever increasing interest in socially responsible investing, and rightly so in my view. However, the S&amp;P is not very ESG. Everybody ""buying the haystack"" is profitting off the fossil fuel industry, war planes, guns, major polluters, animal testing, alcoholism, lung disease, the list goes on. The best performing sector this year was energy, specifically oil and gas companies, the main culprits of climate change. Of course, many people don't care and flout such concerns. But I bet many people in VTI or VT gang don't fully appreciate this relationship and would choose not to invest this way if they knew of a better option. Stock picking allows you to invest in companies you actually support without enriching the insiders of companies you don't. 

In summary, this is r/stocks. We should be encouraging informative and intellectual discussion about stocks, and not ridiculing fellow redditors like they're a bunch of idiots.",3292,592,MinnesotaPower,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/rt12le/a_message_to_all_of_you_who_earned_less_than_30/,rt12le

Going back to 1985 TGT has outperformed COST, but recently 2011 to 2021 COST has outperformed TGT.

TGT looks like a much better value now compared to COST.

So I'm leaning towards a 50/50 split. Maybe 2.5% portfolio each for about 5% of my portfolio.

Are other retail worth considering?   WMT looks terrible as of late and hasn't really done well in comparison to COST and TGT I think. I realize WMT is one of the most powerful companies though, but I'm looking for return of course as we all are!

* Apple
* CMS Energy
* Conocophillips
* Meta
* JPM
* MSFT
* RH
* UAA
* VRTX
* WMT

&gt;The bank is recommending cyclical quality stocks from its high-quality large-cap portfolio, which should help investors capture some upside and outperform to the downside. Each stock has an overweight rating by Wells Fargo analysts, a market cap of more than $3 billion, and “favorable” quality, which is based on debt to EBITDA (or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), profit margins and return on equity.

&gt; “We believe it is time to move up in quality and down in risk,” Harvey said. “The Fed has turned hawkish; we are seeing pricing fatigue; growth is decelerating; market froth is abundant; and risk-averse options are relatively cheap but limited... so expect pressure on multiples.”


....

&gt;Harvey noted that much of consumers’ pent-up demand has been satisfied and retailers might have a harder time hiking prices going forward.

&gt; “We are not worried about the overall health of the U.S. consumer,” Harvey said. “Our focus is more the marginal change as it relates to future spending, since we are beginning to suspect the consumer is no longer the price-taker it was six to 12 months ago.”

So most of this list is pretty standard. Although I'm not very familiar with the cases for RH and UAA. Why doesn't Wells see dampening consumer demand for these products?

2021-12-19 23:48:30,r/stocks,Sitting on WMT,"Background: I've been buying shares of Walmart through my employee stock plan for a bit over a year now.

2021-12-07 00:51:21,r/stocks,Long Term Portfolio Stock Selections,"My aim is long-term retirement inventing, and I am in mid late-20's so my time horizon is 40+ years. I have been maxing my Roth/Traditional IRA's since I was 22, with my investments split 70/30 VTI and VXUS.

The retirement plan at my employer is an ESOP, and we do not have a 401k option. I also do not have an HSA-eligible plan. I only say this to give context that my $6k/yr IRA investment is my primary retirement savings. My ESOP has potential to be substantial, but I do not like to rely on it.

I am opening a brokerage account through Vanguard (where the rest of my accounts are housed) for additional investments. I believe that I can likely put $500 - $1,000/month into account. I would like to continue investing into VTI and VXUS, but also incorporate some individual stock picks. I believe a good balance could be 50/35/15?

I'd like these choices to be somewhat set-and-forget picks that I think can do well to stand the test of my entire timeline. Obviously I can re-evaluate, but this is my aim. I also like the idea of dividend stocks to weather downtimes and still see dividend revenue. Most of the picks below are what I call my ""pessimistic picks"" in that if things are going poorly in the world I believe these companies could survive and possibly thrive.

2021-12-01 20:54:43,r/stocks,"$BGRY - Robotics Company Riding the Huge Wave of Warehouse Staff Shortage and E-grocery Boom and yes, Omicron Variant","**BGRY is the only warehouse robotics company listed and have been hammered by the market.**

Analyzing it the tailwinds and headwinds.

Silverline:

**$BGRY - Berkshire Greyis is making the robots and the AI sofware for Walmart, Target, Fedex and others to keep up with the boom in e-commerce and the supply chain bottle necks.**

**There are almost 19,000 warehouse facilities in the United States, and it is these facilities that represent a critical link in the commerce supply chain. Over 80% of them rely on human work only with no automation, 15% us seom automation, while 5% are automated.**

**There is a huge shortage of staff in the warehouse industry is US. The warehouse and transportation industry had a record 490,000 openings in July 2021, a gap that experts predicted will widen in coming months.**

**All this 3 factors are creating a market that is screaming for help.**

**How BGRY is helping ?**

BGRY robots are making all kind of tasks from piking, sorting, packing or smart shelf replenish in regular retail shops. They have a flexible suit of solutions and AI based sofware that can replicate ""robot work experience"" and can import skills as needed. Walmart $WMT, Fedex $FDX, Target $TGT, Bells, Atos and others are starting to use their solutions.

**Why BGRY is the main protagonist in this market?**

a.**Is the only pure play stock in warehouse logistics. The means faster access to capital generaying faster growth.**

b. **Has the best list of customers that are switching to automatisation to keep up with the new realities: Walmart, Fedx, Target, Bells, Atos etc.**

**c. Has one of the best teams to ride this wave with 2 names that you should remember:**

**CEO Tom Wagner is the former CTO from IROBOT l**eading the tech efforts in the critical years of growth that made IRBT the company that is today (and also made some investors very happy).

**Chief Scientist - Matt Mason - former director of the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon** where he supervised all the activities of the Robotics Institute and the National Robotics Engineering Consortium (NREC). Supervised R&amp;D projects for Walmart, ABB, Kuka, etc., and US technology organizations such as the Army, DARPA, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research.

**d.** **The AI Entreprise Software is a much ore tasty cookie in all this mix. While selling robots is a good busines to be now, the AI cloud with integrated skils for robots will be a market of its own. BGRY as pioneer in this field is building right now years of robot training and skills ready to deploy anywhere in the world.**

**Why BGRY is so cheap right now?**

**Problem**: The sophistication of Berkshire Grey’s system means that right now only the big companies can access those technologies.

**Solution**: While the workforce is getting more expensive and harder to find, warehouse robotics will be adopted by more and more companies while he pioneers in automatisation will speed up the transformation.

**Problem**: BGRY orders are relatively small for the moment

**Solution**: The industry is changing but the speed up has just started. The orders are increasing at an impressive speed and most of them as reccuring orders (like that 25 M order from a [36 M order in October 2021.](https://www.berkshiregrey.com/resources/press-release/berkshire-grey-secures-36-million-in-new-orders/) Last earnings has shown a revenue of $18.8 million in the third quarter of 2021, an increase of $16.6 million or 750% from the third quarter of 2020 and an increase of $14.3 million or 317% from the second quarter of 2021.

**Total backlog (as nov 2021) was 113M in total (de be delivered some in 2021 and some 2022), a 20+% increase from the last quarter only.**

Revenue growth is set 99% CAGR and judging by the numbers recorded this year, this doesn't seem so difficult.

**Problem:** BGRY is not profitable and an rate hike will make them pay more for the capital needed for growth.

**Solution:** The brake even if projected for next year - pretty much when the interest rate hike is expected by the most howkish at the Fed. Also they had some 200M + in cash in NOv. 2021&gt; So cash wise they are pretty much safe and able to grow.

**Why not waiting until BGRY will prove itself and have meaningful EBITDA ?**

The initial valuation of 2B this summer was not that attractive as they had to show some numbers first. Now, after very promising earnings and new contracts ad partnerships, we have a 1.2B EV on the table.

Current EV/E2025EBITDA gives us a 5.2 result. With a conservative 12 EV/EBITDA multiplier Berkshire Grey's EV would be \~ 2.77B or $13.8/share, more than double from current price. 

**Brooks Automation, Inc. (BRKS)** an established robotics &amp; automation company for example, a ev/ebitda over 100 right now.

The growth projected by BGRY didn't factor in 3 important cathlysts: The wage increase in many sectors (warehouses included), the staff shortage and the supply chain bottle necks. The market might speed up to automatisation a lot sooner than expected any spark can get BGRY for a rally.

E-grocery and e-comerce has not slowed significantly during the re-opening and the growth trend is here to stay for years to come.

Fed gov has money and the political will to finance solutions for fixing the supply chain. Automation maight just be one of those solutions.

Amazon already bought Kinva (2012) and Canvas (2019) robotic and automation companies. Amazon is a trend setter and big players outhere might just put a bid on the table for BGRY and the price will fly an never comeback.

Finally - we might have noticed in the news that some countries are closing borders and there is a new spike in infectins across the globe. The winter ahead wil make all the cathalysts mentioned above even more critical. If the new variant(s) prove to be just as deadly as Delta, all e-grocery/e-commerce and robotics will see a renewed interest.

Stocks traded mixed on Thursday, with Nasdaq (QQQ) massively outperforming on the day, driving by strength in mega-caps like Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Amazon (AMZN) while the Dow Jones (DIA) fell for the second straight day. Market participants continue to digest the tail-end of a better-than-expected corporate earnings season amid a backdrop of rising inflation. 

Key Numbers For Today 

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +0.34%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +1.04% 
* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.13%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.41%
* Apple (AAPL): +2.9%
* Amazon (AMZN): +4.14%
* NVIDIA (NVDA): +8.25%
* Alibaba (BABA): -11.26%
* Rivian (RIVN) and Lucid (LCID): -16.4% and -10.47%

After a monster run-up last month, the choppiness in the market can be attributed to mixed economic reports coming out recently. While US retail sales came in better-than-expected, a great sign that consumer demand  is staying robust, the recent report on inflation showed the fastest pace of growth in roughly 30 years. 

Earlier in the week, Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT), two of the largest retailers in the US, reported earnings. While the report was better than expected, executives from both companies raised concerns over rising prices, rising labor costs, and supply-chain disruptions affecting the bottom line. 

The possible staying power of inflation remains the central focus for market participants, as a potential damper to consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP and as a catalyst for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than originally expected. Despite starting to taper the pace of quantitative easing, the Fed has remained very accommodative and says an interest rate hike could take place sometime near the middle of next year. It would be really bad for markets if the timeline is accelerated. 

Adding another wrench in the plans, President Biden is expected to announce his nominee to be the Chair of the Fed. So far, the two main candidates are incumbent Jerome Powell and current Fed Governor Lael Brainard. 

The Labor Department’s Weekly Unemployment Report came in slightly higher than expected but still eked out a new pandemic-era low. Here are the numbers:

* **Initial unemployment claims, week ended November 13:** 268,000 vs. 260,000 expected and an upwardly revised 269,000 during prior week 
* **Continuing claims, week ended November 5:** 2.080 million vs. 2.120 million expected and an upwardly revised 2.209 million during prior week

**Highlights**

* Shares of Alibaba (BABA) fell after the company disappointed in their latest earnings report and slashed guidance for the full year, citing slowing consumption trends in China. Here are the numbers:
   * **Revenue** $31.15 billion vs $32 billion expected
   * **EPS**: $1.74 vs $1.93 expected. 
   * **Guidance Forecast:** 20-23% growth in fiscal 2022 revenue, down from 27% growth expected
* Shares of NVIDIA (NVDA), my personal favorite stock, exploded higher after the company posted record revenues in gaming and data center sales and raised guidance moving forward. CEO Jensen Huang said, “Demand for NVIDIA AI is surging, driven by hyperscale and cloud scale-out, and broadening adoption by more than 25,000 companies. NVIDIA RTX has reinvented computer graphics with ray tracing and AI, and is the ideal upgrade for the large, growing market of gamers and creators, as well as designers and professionals building home workstations."" Here are the numbers:
   * **Revenue:** $7.1 billion versus $6.81 billion expected.
   * **Earnings per share:** $1.17 versus $1.11 expected.
   * **Gaming revenue:** $3.22 billion versus $3.18 billion expected.
   * **Data Center revenue:** $2.94 billion versus $2.69 billion expected.
   * **Forecast for Q4:** Revenue and EPS expected to grow 50% year-over-year, much higher than 38% growth expected

Stocks mostly drifted lower to hover below record levels, as market participants further digested yesterday’s US retail sales report and new corporate earning results from major retailers, which provide further data into consumer spending patterns amid supply-chain disruptions. 

**Here are some key numbers for today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -0.25%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +0.05%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.58%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -1.27%
* Apple (AAPL): +1.75%
* Target (TGT): -4.73%

The Department of Commerce released their monthly Retail Sales Report, which showed better than expected consumer spending trends as the holiday season, by far the busiest in the year, continues to play out. Here are the numbers

* Retail Sales: 1.7% increase vs 1.4% expected
* Core Retail Sales: +1.6%
* Manufacturing Production: +1.2%

The solid report suggests that high inflation is not dampening consumer spending. Rising household wealth, thanks to a strong stock market, house prices, and rising wages appear to be cushioning consumers against the highest annual pace of inflation in roughly thirty years. 

Steven Wieting, Citigroup’s Global Wealth Chief Investment Strategist said, “The markets generally are looking at it \[the pace of inflation\], benignly - they are not discounting some longer-term inflation of more than 2.5%. You can see this in the pricing out on the yield curve of Treasuries. You can see this in the composition of the market with growth stocks not really being beaten down by any concerns about some lurch higher, tightening of monetary policy. We think that story is largely correct – it’s benign for markets. It doesn’t mean we get to repeat the returns from the past year, however.”

Today, Target (TGT) and Lowe’s (LOW), two major retailers in the US, both reported better than expected earnings. This comes on the heels of both Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) both reporting strong earnings results earlier in the week. Here are the numbers (second number were analyst expectation):

**Target (TGT)**: “With a strong inventory position heading into the peak of the holiday season, our team and our business are ready to serve our guests and poised to deliver continued, strong growth, through the holiday season and beyond,"" said Target Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell in a statement. 

* Revenue: $25.7 billion vs. $24.20 billion
* Comparable Store Sales: +12.7% vs. +8.3%
* Gross Margin: 28% vs. 29.80%
* Operating Margin: 7.8% vs. 7.68%
* Diluted EPS: $3.03 vs. $2.84

**Lowe’s (LOW):** “Our momentum continued this quarter, with U.S. sales comps up nearly 34% on a two-year basis, as our Total Home strategy is resonating with the Pro and DIY customer alike. In the quarter, we drove over 16% growth in Pro and 25% on Lowes.com. We also delivered operating margin expansion by driving productivity through disciplined operational execution and cost management”, said Lowe Chairman, President, and CEO Marvin Ellisoln. 

* Revenue: $22.92 billion vs. $22.06 billion 
* Earnings per share: $2.73 vs. $2.36
* $1.90 billion in profits vs $692 million Q3 2020
* Same Store Sales: +2.2% vs -1.5%

**Highlights**

* The party seems over… after a blockbuster IPO, shares of EV startup Rivian (RIVN), which had a market cap of $150 billion on essentially 0 revenue, fell 15% today. In my humble opinion, I’d get out if I had profits (not playing this at all). Shares of Lucid Motors (LCID) were also down roughly 5% in sympathy
* CME Group (CME) the world's largest financial derivatives exchange in the world, trading everything from agricultural products, currencies, energy, interest rates, metals, stock indexes to digital currency futures, announced it was planning to move core trading systems Google Clouds, a massive move in financial markets. Until very recently, it was assumed that cloud computing was ill suited for high frequency trading, forcing these companies to build and develop complicated systems geared for time sensitive markets. If this works, it could reduce the cost of operations by a lot. 
* Fisker (FSR), another EV startup in the market, announced an electric SUV with higher driving range than Tesla’s (TSLA) Model Y. Fisker announced the OCean Ultra SUV, which is planned to begin production next November, has a range of 340 miles and costs $50,000 compared to 300 miles and a cost of $60,000 with the Model Y
* Apple said Wednesday that it has created a self-service repair program that would allow customers to repair their own devices using genuine Apple parts and tools. The iPhone and Mac maker said Self Service Repair would begin in early 2022 with a focus on the most common serviced modules, including phone display, battery and camera, with additional repair options to be added later in the year. The right to repair has been a big controversy surrounding technology sold by companies. 
* According to recent filings, Elon Musk is roughly halfway done with his pledge to sell 10% of his stake in Tesla (TSLA). You can see it here [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/insider-activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/insider-activity)
* Waymo, which is a subsidiary of Google’s parent company Alphabet, said on Wednesday it is expanding its partnership with United Parcel Service (UPS) to move freight using autonomous trucks between two of the parcel delivery company's Texas facilities during the holiday season. This comes amid a shortage of delivery drivers in the US.

Considering both companies had good earning reports. It’s interesting to see the pullback. 
I always look at the fourth quarter or December is the holy Grail for retailing.

The analyst in pundits all had comments as to why the pullback occurred. Walmart is the most intriguing since CEO Doug McMillan said that he basically did not raise prices in order to help the consumer.

They have not performed as well over the last 24 months as target has. Do you consider both of them a good buy?

**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 16, 2021**

Stocks gained today, with market participants releasing a sigh of relief as new economic data showed consumer demand remains strong despite ongoing supply-chain disruptions and labor shortages. Moreover, major retailers like Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Lowe’s (LOW), and Home Depot (HD) are set to release quarterly earnings this week, giving us more information into the state of consumer spending in the US. As a reminder, consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP.

The Department of Commerce released their monthly Retail Sales Report, which showed better than expected consumer spending trends as the holiday season, by far the busiest in the year, continues to play out. Here are the numbers

* Retail Sales: 1.7% increase vs 1.4% expected
* Core Retail Sales: +1.6%
* Manufacturing Production: +1.2%

The solid report suggests that high inflation is not dampening consumer spending. Rising household wealth, thanks to a strong stock market, house prices, and rising wages appear to be cushioning consumers against the highest annual pace of inflation in roughly thirty years. 

Matthew Shay, President of the National Retail Federation, said of the report, “Today’s numbers show that consumers are getting a jump on their holiday shopping. We continue to urge consumers to shop early and shop safely, and we fully expect this holiday season to be one for the record books”.

Meanwhile, two of the largest retailers in the US, Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD), reported earnings today, with both companies demolishing earnings (though WMT stock did not react positively). Here are the numbers:

* **Walmart (WMT)** 
   * Revenue: $140.53 billion vs $135.60 billion expected 
   * Earnings per Share (EPS): $1.45 vs $1.40 expected
   * Sames Store Sales: +9.2% vs +6.9% expected 
   * eCommerce Sales: +8% vs +1.9% expected 
* **Home Depot (HD)**
   * Revenue: $36.82 billion vs $35.01 billion expected
   * Earnings per Share (EPS): $3.92 vs $3.40 expected
   * Same Store Sales: +6.1% vs 1.9% expected

These reports came at the tail end of what has already been an exceptionally strong earnings season. As of Friday, 92% of S&amp;P 500 companies had reported actual results, and of these, 81% of them had reported better-than-expected earnings results, according to FactSet.

**Highlights**

* Somehow, someway, shares of Rivian (RIVN) keep rising after its blockbuster IPO, with the company now being the third largest auto manufacturer by market cap at roughly $150 billion despite barely completing any deliveries. This is, by far, the craziest valuation I’ve ever seen. 
* The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that import prices rose 1.2% on a monthly basis in October, coming in well above the 0.4% rise for September. This was also above the 1.0% increase consensus economists expected for October, according to Bloomberg data.
* Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM) are on fire after the company projected that its chipset business will average “midteens” revenue growth through its fiscal year 2024. That’s well above the 8% average contemplated by Wall Street’s current estimates.
* Netflix (NFLX) is set to release the highly anticipated sequel to Tiger King tomorrow. It seems like Netflix has been on an amazing roll as of late and now has a higher market cap than Disney (DIS)
* Lucid Motors (LCID) has now overtaken Ford Motors (F) in market cap
* Apple (AAPL) is reportedly working to make its own in-house modem chip that allows wireless connection for iPhones by 2023. Qualcomm (QCOM), which currently supplies modem chips for all Apple devices, estimates Apple will self-supply 80% of modem chips by 2023.

# [Stock futures are flat as investors evaluate big retail earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/15/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained after better-than-expected results from Walmart and Home Depot.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow, which contains the two big retailers, added 70 points, or 0.19%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures were slightly in the red.
*****
&gt; Walmart kicked off a busy week of retail earnings by saying third-quarter profit and revenue was well above estimates with U.S. same-store sales jumping 9.2%, excluding fuel. The company also raised its forecast for 2021, saying adjusted earnings per share will be around $6.40 versus its prior expectations of between $6.20 and $6.35. The shares moved slighly lower in premarket trading.
*****
&gt; Home Depot gained more than 1%, however, after its third-quarter earnings beat estimates on a 9.8% sales burst.
*****
&gt; Retail sales figures for October came in 1.7% higher than 0.7% in September, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expected sales to have jumped by 1.5%.
*****
&gt; Industrial production numbers will also be released Tuesday, as well as the NAHB housing market index survey.
*****
&gt; During regular trading Monday, the Dow dipped about 13 points, or 0.04%, for its fourth negative session in the last five. At the high of the day the 30-stock index gained about 136 points. The S&amp;P 500 finished the day unchanged at 4,682.87. The benchmark index moved between gains and losses during the session, at one point gaining 0.3%, while also trading 0.21% lower. The Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.04%. The Russell 2000 was the relative underperformer, declining 0.45%.
*****
&gt; Stocks’ move came as interest rates rose, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note topping 1.62% while the 30-bear Treasury bond rose above 2%.
*****
&gt; Inflation fears are weighing on the market after last month’s consumer price index posted its largest annual increase in more than three decades. Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he believes inflation will moderate in 2022, but that “the path to lower inflation [will] begin with higher inflation in the front half of the year.”
*****
&gt; “The stickier drivers of inflation are likely to persist, but our base case is that they will not outweigh the improvement we expect in the transitory elements,” he wrote in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; On Monday afternoon President Joe Biden signed the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill into law. The package includes funding for transportation, broadband and utilities.
*****
&gt; The major averages are coming off their first negative week in six, but stocks are still trading around all-time high levels. As Wall Street strategists look to 2022 some, including Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson, believe the picture looks muted.
*****
&gt; “With financial conditions tightening and earnings growth slowing, the 12-month risk/reward for the broad indices looks unattractive at current prices,” he said Monday in a note to clients. “However, strong nominal GDP growth should continue to provide plenty of good investment opportunities at the stock level for active managers,” he added. His 12-month base target for the S&amp;P 500 is 4,400, which is 6% below where the index closed on Monday.

2021-11-15 23:39:35,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, Nov 15, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 15, 2021**

Stocks finished mixed, with the Dow Jones (DIA) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closing modestly lower, as market participants digested upbeat economic data coming from China and await for a key report on retail sales in the US later this week. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, underperformed on the day, closing 0.44% lower.

Stronger than expected economic data coming out of China helped lift the sentiments of market participants following last week’s inflation report. The world's second-largest economy saw both retail sales and industrial production unexpectedly rise in October in a year-over-year period, suggesting that China’s economy is holding up better than expected amid new stay-in-place restrictions and ongoing power shortages. However, prices of new homes dropped 0.25% in October versus September, marking the biggest drop in more than six years as the nation’s real estate market remains under pressure from the Evergrande situation. Here are the numbers:

* Retail Sales: +4.9% YoY vs +3.5 expected
* Industrial Production: +3.5% YoY vs +3% expected

Tomorrow, market participants will receive the Commerce Department’s monthly Retail Sales report, which is expected to show a 1.3% year-over-year rise in retail sales, improving from September’s disappointing 0.7% rise. Moreover, major retailers like Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD), and Lowe’s (LOW) are set to report Q3 earnings, which will offer additional data regarding the state of consumer demand.

Last week, markets were spooked by the pace of inflation, with the recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) showing the fastest pace of increase in roughly 30 years. which showed prices soared 6.2% in a year-on-year period, accelerating from September’s 5.4% YoY rate, and higher than the 5.9% expected. The staying power and magnitude of inflationary pressures has, perhaps, become the central question for market participants, with companies across the board reporting rising input costs and price hikes passed on to the consumers to preserve margins. While Q3 earning results have robustly demonstrated that companies in the SPY were largely able to navigate these cost pressures, the possibility remains that if inflation runs hotter than expected for longer than expected, it could begin to hamper consumer demand.

Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note to clients, “The surge in core inflation in October marks the start of a run of big gains, thanks to surging used auto prices, rebounding airline fares, and faster increases in housing costs. We think core inflation will peak at almost 7% in March, which will pose a serious challenge to the Fed's benign medium-term view. Chair \[Jerome\] Powell will have to convince markets that the combination of rocketing payrolls and soaring inflation does not threaten the transitory story, to which he appears still to be committed. We remain of the view that the Fed will start to hike in September, but a June hike can't be ruled out. If labor participation shows no sign of life by the March FOMC meeting, we expect the Fed to accelerate the taper and then hike in June. This would play badly across all asset markets.” As always, it is important to acknowledge and understand the risks present in the market.

**Highlights**

* Shares of Boeing (BA) surged after the company said it was “hopeful” China would resume order of the 737 Max two years after its grounding.
* U.S. crude oil output from the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico is set to jump to a record 4.95 million barrels per day in December, a new government forecast showed on Monday. This would bring production in the key U.S. shale patch well above its pre-pandemic average from March 2020.
* Shares of oat-milk maker Oatly (OTLY) fell more than 20% after missing earnings expectations and cutting guidance. The stock is down roughly 50% since IPO back in late-May.
* Shares of Snap (SNAP) were up after the company reached a deal with Sony Music Entertainment to allow the company to use its artist and sounds on the Snapchat App.
* Twitter Inc said on Monday it will expand free access to the social networking site's data to help software developers create tools and products that could promote safer online conversations or curate content. The move is part of Twitter's growing effort over the past year to decentralize the company, a vision that aims to give users more control over what content they see in their Twitter feed or have new ways of sharing content on the site, Amir Shevat, Twitter's head of product for the developer platform, said in an interview.
* Amazon.com Inc has reached a deal to sell virtual medical services to Hilton Hotels in the United States, one of the first major customers for the company’s burgeoning healthcare business. Amazon Care is an on-demand health offering that lets users message or video-chat clinicians and receive home visits in some cities.
* UK ministers are expected to order an in-depth investigation of Nvidia Corp's planned $40 billion acquisition of British chip designer ARM over antitrust and national security concerns. As a huge NVDA bull, hope all goes well!
* Social Finance Tech (SOFI) announced an offering of 50 million shares. The stock is down as a result. Not surprising for management to take advantage of this massive runup
* Shares of oat-meal maker Oatly (OTLY) gapped down -20% after missing earnings expectations and cutting guidance moving forward. After a promising start, the stock is now roughly -50% since its IPO

# **Inflation remains the hot topic in week ahead as Walmart and other key retailers report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/12/inflation-remains-the-hot-topic-in-week-ahead-as-walmart-and-other-key-retailers-report.html)**
*****
&gt; Consumers are in the spotlight in the week ahead, with the imminent release of retail sales for October and earnings from major chain stores.
*****
&gt; Retail sales is the big economic report for the week, when the Census Bureau releases October data on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said he’s also looking at the New York Federal Reserve’s Empire state manufacturing survey Monday for updates on prices paid. The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey, a measure of growth in that region, is released Thursday.
*****
&gt; “That’s going to be key, outside of that it’s retail sales,” Boockvar said. “I think the inflation story will continue to dominate the headlines and the news flow in markets and what the Fed does.”
*****
&gt; Investors will also be watching the outcome of the virtual meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday evening.
*****
&gt; “I think it’s good that they would be on a talking basis,” Boockvar said. “I don’t think anything would come out of it unless there’s some shocking change in the tariff situation, but I doubt anything will happen.”
*****
&gt; # Chain store earnings
&gt; The earnings season is winding down, but the big-box stores have yet to report. Walmart and Home Depot release results Tuesday, and Target reports Wednesday.
*****
&gt; “Walmart is a pretty big barometer for the health of the consumer for sure, and it will be interesting to see how they handle margins,” National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said. Rising costs have been pressuring companies across industries, and many have raised prices in response.
*****
&gt; Based on the latest sentiment data Friday, consumers are getting worried about rising prices. The University of Michigan’ consumer sentiment index dropped to a 10-year low of 66.8 in the preliminary November report, from 71.7 in October.
*****
&gt; “It’s so important to look at what consumers do, versus what they say,” Hogan said. He said retail sales are expected to be up 1.1%, compared to a 0.7% gain in September.
*****
&gt; “The trend that we’re looking for in the next week is sequential improvement in economic data,” Hogan said. “That’s the important thing to focus on.”
*****
&gt; Other data in the coming week includes industrial production Tuesday. Housing starts and building permits data will be released Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Inflation also proved to be a problem in the stock market this past week, after both producer prices and consumer prices increased more than expected. The consumer price index jumped 6.2%, a three-decade high.
*****
&gt; Stocks snapped a five-week winning streak, and all major indices were lower in the past week. The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.3% for the week, at 4,682. The Nasdaq and Russell 2000 saw the biggest declines, falling 0.7% and 1% respectively.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields rose, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner to combat inflation.
*****
&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.57% on Friday afternoon, and the 2-year yield traded at 0.52%. Yields move opposite price.
*****
&gt; The best performing major S&amp;P equities sector was materials, an inflation play that gained more than 2.5%. The worst performer was the consumer discretionary sector, which includes retailers: It declined nearly 3.2%.
*****
&gt; Hogan said even with inflation fears, he expects stocks to continue to rise.
*****
&gt; “I think we continue to grind higher. We did the larger reset that we needed, which was six weeks - in September and two weeks of October,” he said. “The good news is demand hasn’t been destroyed. It’s been delayed.” Hogan said supply chain issues should get sorted out. He noted that some components of CPI, like higher used car prices, show that the inflation should be temporary.
*****
&gt; Trivariate Research founder Adam Parker said he expects the market to continue its march higher. “What would make me call for a correction in the market would be two things — hubris and debt,” he said. Neither of those are currently a problem, since he does not see signs of “management gone awry” and many companies restructured their debt.
*****
&gt; Managements are not engaging in arrogant behavior that would be more common at a market top, like excessive spending, he said.
*****
&gt; Parker said he expects mid-single digit earnings growth. “I think we could be pretty constructive for the next couple of quarters,” he said.

&gt; # Best and Worst S&amp;P 500 Stocks Since September 30th

&gt; The past month has seen the S&amp;P 500 pivot and rally higher after declines throughout the month of September. Since the end of Q3, the S&amp;P has now gained 8.6%, which is slightly off the highs from earlier this month. Earnings season has been in full swing over the past few weeks meaning there have been plenty of stocks with catalysts for big moves since the end of September. Below we show the stocks that have risen and fallen the most since September 30th.

&gt; Topping the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH) having rallied 67.77% in the past month and a half. The bulk of that gain came after earnings as the stock leaped 24.65% the day after reporting and plenty of follow-through in the days after. Arista Networks (ANET) is also up over 50%. Like ENPH, a large portion of ANET's move came from an over 20% gain on earnings in response to a triple play. There are 18 other stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have risen by more than 25% since the end of September. The largest of those are NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).

&gt; Only 18% of the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower since September 30th, and by far the biggest decliner has been Moderna (MRNA). Although it has fallen a dramatic 41% in a short span, that eats into what have been very strong gains this year. Even after its decline so far in Q4, MRNA has still more than doubled year to date. The only other biggest decliners since September that are still up year to date are Garmin (GRMN), Allstate (ALL), Carnival (CCL), and Dish Network (DISH).

&gt; # Week Before Thanksgiving, DJIA up 19 of 28, but weaker lately

&gt; Next week is not only November’s monthly option expiration week, but it is also the last full week of trading before Thanksgiving. DJIA has a reasonably solid track record over the last 28 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.41%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks have not been as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 18 years with a median loss of 0.09%.

&gt; S&amp;P is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.24% and down 10 of the last 18, –0.16% median loss. NASDAQ is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.28% and down 9 of the last 18, +0.07% median gain. Russell 2000 is up 15 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.54% and down 10 of the last 18, –0.20% median loss. If weakness does manifest next week, it may be a good set up for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.

&gt; # Reasons To Be Thankful

&gt; As we reach the home stretch of 2021, there is a lot to be thankful for. Stocks are having an amazing year, the economy is improving, and COVID-19 trends are going the right direction. Let’s look at some reasons to be thankful.

&gt; What an amazing year and incredible recent run in stocks. The S&amp;P 500 Index just made 8 consecutive all-time highs for the first time since 1997 and it was up 17 out of 19 days for the first time since 1971. Along the way, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 25% year-to-date in the month of November, making it one of the best years ever.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has made 65 new all-time highs this year, tied for the second most in any year ever (tied with 1964), with only 77 in 1995 higher. Although it is still a longshot, there’s a chance we could see 13 more new highs and break the record, something to be thankful for indeed.

&gt; “Although the economy did slow in the third quarter, it looks like that was a one-off event due to supply chain issues and the Delta variant,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We fully expect growth to pick up over the coming quarters as the economy continues to rebound thanks to a very healthy and strong U.S. consumer.”

&gt; From the best services number ever, to job growth beating expectations, to inflation and supply chain issues showing signs of peaking, to consumers with trillions of dollars in savings, there are many reasons to expect the economy to remain strong as we head into 2022.

&gt; At the end of the day, though, it is all about earnings. So, while the economy might have slowed in the third quarter, earnings once again came in much better than expected, showing how agile corporate America can be. S&amp;P 500 earnings are tracking to a 39% year-over-year increase in the third quarter, more than 12 percentage points above expectations with still more than 40 index constituents left to report. As our Earnings Season Dashboard shows below, there is a lot to be thankful for as it pertains to earnings.

&gt; Lastly, the trends in COVID-19 are going the right way, with the number of hospitalizations down more than 50% from the September peak. With booster shots on the way and kids allowed to get vaccinated, there are many tailwinds to a continuation of the reopening we’ve been seeing. This is definitely something to be thankful for.

&gt; # Sentiment Steadily Moving Higher

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has encountered some selling pressure this week, but that hasn't stopped sentiment from continuing its grind higher. The weekly AAII sentiment survey saw 48.0% of respondents report as bullish this week up from 41.5% last week. That puts bullish sentiment at the highest level since the first week of July when it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it is now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; The increase in bullish sentiment borrowed from bears as less than a quarter of respondents reported having negative sentiment for the first time since the last week of July. Similar to bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment is now at the lowest level since the first week of July when it came in at 22.2%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; Overall, sentiment continues to favor bulls to a wide margin. As a result of the inverse moves in sentiment, the bull-bear spread rose to 24 from 15.5 last week. Again, that is levels not seen since early July.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Spread.png))**

&gt; Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling by 4.5 percentage points to 28%. Unlike bullish and bearish sentiment, that reading is basically in the middle of the past several months' range as the reading has generally hovered around the 30% level.

&gt; # Small Business Economic Outlook Dour

&gt; This morning the NFIB released the results of their October survey of small business sentiment. The report saw small business sentiment fall for the second month in a row. At 98.2, the index is now back to the same level it was at this past March.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-HL.png))**

&gt; With the decline in the headline reading, breadth was terrible with only one index that is an input to the optimism index—Plans to Make Capital Outlays—moving higher month over month. The various indices are now all over the place with regards to their own historical ranges. For example, Higher Prices, Compensation, and Compensation Plans all hit a record high while Expectations for the Economy to Improve and Credit Conditions for Regular Borrowers are just off of record lows.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Table.png))**

&gt; Sales and earnings-related topics weighed on optimism in October. A net negative percentage of responding firms reported weaker actual and earnings changes. Meanwhile, the weakest percentage of respondents reported now as a good time to expand since February. Alongside that weaker reading, Outlook for General Business Conditions continues to collapse and is now at the second-lowest level on record; only slightly above the low from nine years ago. One potential factor playing into that weak sentiment is higher prices as that index hit another record.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Sales.png))**

&gt; While the headline Small Business Optimism index has declined, it has held up considerably well relative to the massive drop in the Outlook for General Business Conditions. As shown below, the spread between the two is now at a record high dating back to 1986.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Spread.png))**

&gt; While there were some signs of cooling in October, overall the employment metrics in the report continue to be historically strong. Hiring Plans were unchanged at 26 which is off the late summer peak but still above any pre-pandemic level. While firms do not plan to take on as many workers as they had planned a few months ago, they are at least paying them better. Both Compensation and Compensation Plans continue to surge to new record highs. That has appeared to have some effect as the number of firms reporting Job Openings as Hard to Fill fell modestly. Additionally, as we noted in today's Morning Lineup, fewer businesses are reporting labor problems as their biggest concern.

2021-10-27 01:35:37,r/stocks,Looking for some advice for my first stock portfolio,"I’m not from the US so I don’t use TD ameritrade nor any other internacionally used broker and the one I use which is from my country just released the option to buy fractions of stocks so I wanted to invest a little money I got “picking the stocks myself” (I’ve only invested in ETF’s and crypto). I’m young, I don’t have any debts and want to start learning how this works so I’m not really worried about the risk this takes. 
I have already in mind stocks like AMZN, GOOGL, AAPL, MSFT, FB, NVDA, DIS, NFLX, EBAY, ABNB, WMT, PFE, BA, TSLA, JNJ.
I know most of the ones I just mentioned are like, well known and I think are kind of “conservative” (because of their market cap), but anyways…
Are those good options? Which stocks would you recommend or which ones of the ones I listed should I not buy? Of course I’ll do my own research but I want to get some ideas first.

&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed about 164 points, or 0.5%. S&amp;P 500 futures added 0.5% and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.4%.
*****
&gt; The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 come into Tuesday both sitting about 1% from record highs.
*****
&gt; Dow member Travelers saw its shares gain more than 3% in the premarket after the insurance company’s quarterly earnings report topped expectations.
*****
&gt; Fifth Third Bancorp shares ticked up in early morning trading after its profit and revenue beat Wall Street estimates.
*****
&gt; Procter &amp; Gamble continued the bullish trend with better-than-expected earnings, but its shares dipped more than 1% in premarket trading. The consumer products giant said it is raising prices to cover rising commodity and freight costs and warned that inflation may continue.
*****
&gt; Johnson &amp; Johnson also beat third-quarter earnings expectations by 25 cents per share, but saw its shares dip in early morning trading.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere, Walmart shares gained around 2% in the premarket after Goldman Sachs added the big box retailer to its conviction buy list, saying the stock could rally nearly 40%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 36 points, dragged down by a 3% drop in Disney’s stock.
*****
&gt; While reports have been strong, investors are looking for commentary from corporate America about supply chain issues and inflation.
*****
&gt; “The financials got earnings season off to another strong start, but let’s be honest, COVID and supply chain issues aren’t going to impact this group. Now it gets very interesting to see what other industries will have to say about the health of the economic recovery,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.
*****
&gt; Netflix could set the tone for technology earnings this season. Three months ago, the streaming giant forecasted paid net subscriber adds of 3.5 million, while analysts expect about 3.84 million, according to StreetAccount. Analysts are also forecasting fourth-quarter subscriber guidance of 8.5 million, which would be the highest outlook since the first quarter of 2019.
*****
&gt; Shares of Netflix have traded lower on six of its last seven earnings releases.
*****
&gt; Earnings from United Airlines should give investors a gauge on the travel recovery from the pandemic and Procter &amp; Gamble earnings could show how strong the consumer is in the goods sector.
*****
&gt; Stocks are coming off of a winning week but have been volatile since September. Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity strategist Mike Wilson — who has been calling for a correction in the broader market — told clients on Monday that although fundamentals are deteriorating, the market seems to be resilient to a bigger pullback.
*****
&gt; “Whether we end up getting this finishing move at the index level this year or not will depend largely on retail participation, the message that 3Q earnings brings from a guidance standpoint, and the path of PMIs into year end,” said Wilson.
*****
&gt; Economic data from China weighed on investor sentiment after it reported low GDP and industrial production for September that fell short of expectations. Industrial production in the U.S. also fell for September as supply constraints continued to hinder manufacturing, the Federal Reserve reported Monday.

2021-10-13 22:26:50,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, October 13, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, October 13, 2021**

***Hey Psychos!! Today's recap is a bit longer than usual because there was a lot of really important information released. I urge you to read until the end, especially the part regarding the CPI.***

Stocks finished mostly even, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) leading the day as market participants digested the start of earnings season, the consumer and producer price indexes, which showed an acceleration in inflation, and the Federal Reserve’s September meeting minutes, which are basically notes of what was discussed in the meeting. 

While supply-side disruptions have been going on since the beginning of the pandemic (when the world was essentially forced to shut down overnight), recent developments reflect the extent of these disruptions heading into the holidays, by far the busiest season for retailers. Due to congestions in the ports and sky-high shipping rates, companies like Target (TGT), Costco (COST), and Walmart (WMT) have resorted to chartering their own ships and diverting the usual routes to less congested ports. In a statement, Target recently said “As co-managers of the ship, we can avoid delays from additional stops and steer clear of particularly backed-up ports.”

In addition, President Biden met with leaders from the Port of Los Angeles, the Port of Long Beach, and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union to discuss supply chain issues at the ports. In the end, the parties agreed to expand port operations activities to be 24/7 nationwide. 

The latest batch of economic data due Wednesday confirmed that these supply and demand mismatches translated to ongoing inflationary pressures.  Labor Department's Consumer Price Index, core prices, excluding food and energy, rose by 4.0% in September over last year, coming down only slightly from June's 30-year high of 4.5%. And a broader measure of consumer prices including all categories rose 5.4% in September compared to last year, coming in at the fastest pace since 2008. Please, before you ask why food and energy are excluded from core CPI, read the exact reason by the Federal Reserve below. 

To understand why the categories of food and energy are more sensitive to price changes and thus not useful measures when considering broad inflationary measures, consider environmental factors that can ravage a year’s crops or fluctuations in the oil supply resulting from the OPEC cartel. Each is an example of a supply shock that may affect the prices for that product. However, although the prices of those goods may frequently increase or decrease at rapid rates, the price disturbances may not be related to a trend change in the economy’s overall price level. Instead, changes in food and energy prices often are more likely related to temporary factors that may reverse themselves later. Basically, including food and energy prices economists may be fooled into believing that general prices are rising or falling more rapidly than they really are

Please, I urge you to read the Fed’s exact reasoning as to why Core CPI is taken as the real measure of inflation, I’ve seen a TON of misinformation spreading about this across social media. Core CPI has been calculated the exact same way for decades, I don’t understand why it became so controversial this year. Please read to link below, it is fundamentally necessary for us market participants to understand how this works. 

[https://www.frbsf.org/education/publications/doctor-econ/2004/october/core-inflation-headline/](https://www.frbsf.org/education/publications/doctor-econ/2004/october/core-inflation-headline/)

In the latest monthly monetary policy meeting, the Fed signaled it would likely begin reducing the pace of asset-purchasing by $15 billion per month starting in November or December. As a reminder, since early on in the pandemic, the Fed implemented a program of quantitative easing at a clip of $120 billion per month. This is exactly what I said would happen last month, and it seems the market already priced this in. Like I have said multiple times before, I remain bullish until the Fed begins discussing raising the interest rate. 

Q3 earnings season kicked off with JP Morgan (JPM), the largest bank in the US, and BlackRock (BLK), the largest asset management company in the world, reporting earnings. Both smashed earnings estimates. Here are the numbers

**JP Morgan - JPM**

* Revenue of $30.44 billion v $29.8 billion expected
* Earnings per share of $3.74 v $3 expected

**BlackRock - BLK**

* Asset Under Management (AUM): $9.46 trillion v $7.81 trillion last year
* Revenue of $5.1 billion v $4.9 billion expected
* Earnings per share of $10.95 v $9.54

Wall Street analysts are looking for third-quarter earnings growth of about 27% on a year-over-year basis, [according to FactSet data. ](https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_100821.pdf)Though this would still be the third-fastest earnings growth rate since 2010, it would be a marked slowdown from the second quarter's nearly 90% pace.

2021-10-12 13:22:16,r/stocks,Earnings are headed for an all-time high if supply-chain and staffing woes don’t get in the way,"Corporate earnings reached a record in the first half of 2021, and analysts expect that the rest of the year will add up to yet another record-breaker. There are some concerns about that path, however. Namely, the issues that industries are experiencing as staffing shortages impact the supply chain, which could hurt the ability of retailers to get enough goods to sell to consumers this holiday season. As earnings season kicks off this week, analysts expect that S&amp;P 500 SPX, -0.69% earnings will increase 27.6% year over year, which seems strong until you compare it with the two previous quarters — earnings increased 52.8% in the first quarter and 92.4% in the second quarter, as companies lapped the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those two quarters produced the largest net income on record for a six-month period, according to Dow Jones Market Data, which has records dating back to 2008.

Expectations are for the second half — which is typically bigger, thanks to back-to-school and holiday shopping — to produce the biggest profit for the year as well. But companies are starting to get nervous about the supply-chain issues that have popped up and could get in the way of continued earnings power.

So far this young earnings season, 21 companies have reported third-quarter earnings, and nearly three-fourths of them — 15 of the 21 — have mentioned negative effects of supply-chain disruptions in their earnings calls, FactSet Senior Earnings Analyst John Butters wrote in a note Friday. Just behind, with 14 of the 21, was staffing issues and labor costs, which are believed to be at the heart of the supply-chain issues. Those issues could show up in many places, including lost revenue from the inability to obtain goods and services to sell to consumers or companies, but also in the costs that companies must bear. For instance, large retailers such as Walmart Inc. WMT, -0.09%, Target Corp. TGT, -0.08%, Home Depot Inc. HD, +0.79% and Costco Wholesale Corp. COST, -0.48% have taken to chartering their own ships to ensure supply, which will show up in their costs and could cut into profit. For investors, the prospect of supply-chain and staffing issues getting in the way of an earnings beat is not a small matter. The S&amp;P 500 is trading well ahead of its five- and 10-year average for forward price-to-earnings, as Butters pointed out, with a forward P/E of 20.5, though that number is at one of its lowest points of the past 18 months. Butters pointed out the still elevated P/E ratio is partly because investors expect companies to beat on earnings, as they have historically. During the past five years, actual earnings for the S&amp;P 500 have outpaced expected earnings by 8.4% on average, leading the earnings growth rate to top the expected rate by an average of 7.2% throughout the earnings season. Those numbers have exploded higher in the past five quarters, however, as concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic have failed to show up in corporate earnings results, with outperformance in that period hitting 19.1% on average, according to Butters. DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas wrote in a Monday morning research note that companies will have to come closer to the second number than the first to see any gains for stocks in the coming months. “The companies of the S&amp;P 500 need to beat by an aggregate 10 percentage points this quarter, or we’ve almost certainly seen the highs on U.S. equity markets for the year,” he wrote. The flood of reports really kicks off this week, with banks and other early reports.

**This week in earnings**

Four of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.72% components are on track to report this week, while 18 S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to reveal numbers. Outside of the major indexes, keep an eye out for Alcoa Corp. AA, +2.74%, which used to matter a lot more than it does now.

2021-09-24 12:04:56,r/stocks,"I broke a personal Margin rule, help on how to exit gracefully.","I have a taxable trade account that I put my extra savings into, I have it margin enabled to take advantage of short term buy opportunities.  For example, 2 days ago I bought NVDA on margin and have a 7.5% gain.  I should sell it now to keep from over extending margin (haven't sold yet).  That is how I intended to use margin...(buy, hold for a day or two, sell).  This was meant to be done rarely and only when the opportunity presented itself.  I never intended to long term hold margin.

In the spring, I took a big position in AAPL when it dipped under $130.  It kept going down so I kept buying.  That position is up quite nicely. (I'd like to learn how to spot the bottom and buy on the way up, but that's for later).

Around the same time, I took positions in (and am still holding) MSFT, NVDA, V &amp; WMT, which are all up.  I also have some taxable GME gains from earlier this year too.

I also took positions in (and am still holding) ARKW &amp; CRSR.  The losses on these positions almost wash the AAPL gains.  CRSR is especially frustrating as I really do think it should be in the mid $30's.

Since the AAPL gains and ARKW &amp; CRSR losses pretty much wash, when the market dipped earlier this week the entire account was showing a loss.  It's back up but still lower than where it was a few weeks ago.

So, here's the problem: as it sits, a bit less than half my positions are currently held in margin and I don't have any more funds to send in to reduce it.  I'm pretty certain I want to eliminate my margin holdings.  The only way to do that is to sell positions.  I just don't know when and how many of which shares I should trim.

I can't tell if we're going to be going into more or less volatility in the coming weeks so I don't exactly know what to do.

If I cut the losers and CRSR finally bounces, I'll be very frustrated but those losses will reduce my taxable GME gains.  If I trim all holdings equally it just seems unfocused.

Suggestions on what and when to trim?",0,0,dreamliner330,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pugmva/i_broke_a_personal_margin_rule_help_on_how_to/,pugmva

# **Markets brace for hot consumer inflation report in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/10/markets-brace-for-hot-consumer-inflation-report-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Investors are paying close attention to any reading on inflation these days, and the consumer price index will be the big one to watch in the coming week.
*****
&gt; The latest snapshot of the economy comes just a week before the Federal Reserve’s important September meeting. At that meeting, the Fed is expected to discuss more details about its plan to taper down its bond buying program, or quantitative easing.
*****
&gt; Market professionals say a hotter inflation reading could speed up the Fed’s plans to slow the $120 billion a month in bond purchases. The paring back of its asset purchase program would be the Fed’s first major step away from the easy policy it put in place to combat the pandemic.
*****
&gt; The consumer price index is expected Tuesday, and there is retail sales data is released Thursday. They are expected to show consumer prices jumped at a 5.3% annual pace in August, according to the consensus estimate from FactSet, while the consumer continued to pull back from the high spending levels of earlier in the year.
*****
&gt; # Hot CPI
&gt; “If the CPI is hotter than expected, it could make the difference between a September announcement for tapering or waiting to November,” Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said.
*****
&gt; Economists expect CPI to rise at a 0.4% pace month over month. The report comes after August’s producer price index — which was released Friday — showed a jump of 8.3% year over year, due in part to supply chain constraints.
*****
https://i.imgur.com/3ia6fMl.png
*****
&gt; The Fed’s formal announcement about tapering its bond-buying program, also called QE, is widely expected in November or December. Many of those who had expected a September announcement pushed back their time frame to later in the year after August’s employment report showed just 235,000 jobs added, about 500,000 less than expected.
*****
&gt; “Certainly the trend has been for the inflation number to come in above expectations. I think if that happens again, it will feed the narrative that high inflation is going to stick. Obviously, it’s an issue for the bond market if it’s viewed at all as accelerating the timing of the QE tapering, and or accelerating the timing of the first rate hike,” CIBC Private Wealth U.S. chief investment officer David Donabedian said. That would be a negative for stocks.
*****
&gt; “If markets have an inflation mutiny here and there’s volatility as a result, they could move it up to September,” Donabedian said of the Fed’s taper announcement. “But I think there’s kind of a one in four likelihood in my view.”
*****
&gt; # Stagflation?
&gt; That combination of higher inflation and slower spending, particularly after August’s weaker jobs report, has spurred talk about the threat of stagflation. Those worries have also increased as economists ratchet back growth forecasts for the third quarter to a still high level just above 5%, from above 6%.
*****
&gt; “I’m more about the ‘flation’ side of it than the ‘stag.’ I think the economy is going to perform fine right through next year,” Donabedian said. He said the slowdown in consumer spending after stimulus checks had boosted retail sales earlier in the year is not surprising and may be just a “short-term warning.”
*****
&gt; “We had this explosive growth in retail sales early in the year as a direct result of stimulus payments and vaccines coming and a burst of consumer optimism. It’s really settled down now,” he said. “There was an enormous amount of liquidity and saving and they spent what they spent out of that extra amount of savings and you’re going through a bit of a retracement here, which is why you’re seeing economists mark down their third quarter estimates. Consumer fundamentals are pretty good.”
*****
&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said he expects the CPI report to show that inflation is peaking, just as the Fed has said. But he says the slowing trend is not just an issue for consumer spending. It is also showing up in business spending and housing.
*****
&gt; “With where labor markets are, August was a bit of an egg. But growth in employment has been solid on average, very robust over the course of the year,” he said. “Even though employment disappointed in August, hours and and earnings were still pretty good. There’s income there for consumers to spend. We’re looking at this as a short-term hiccup.”
*****
&gt; Gapen said third-quarter economic growth may be somewhat slower than expected. However, he said some of the lost growth could show up in the fourth quarter.
*****
&gt; “It has some characteristics of stagflation, but true stagflation is rising unemployment and rising inflation. We don’t have that,” he said. “These are bottlenecks that are kind of constraining the pace of the recovery and lead to higher inflation. Demand isn’t the problem right now. Supply is. The unemployment rate is still coming down and employment is improving. It has the whiff but I wouldn’t call it stagflation.”
*****
https://i.imgur.com/tjC3emB.png
*****
&gt; Donabedian expects higher prices and shortages to continue into next year, as supply chains keep getting disrupted. Some companies, including PPG and General Electric, have already commented on how they see issues with supplies stretching into 2022. Donabedian expects to see more warnings ahead of the third-quarter earnings season.
*****
&gt; Stocks were lower this week, with the S&amp;P 500 losing 1.7% to 4,458. The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield has held above 1.3% and was at 1.33% on Friday.
*****
&gt; A number of strategists expect to see the stock market pullback during the typically choppy September and October period. Some say the Fed’s September meeting could be a catalyst, especially if the central bank sounds particularly hawkish.
*****
https://i.imgur.com/IP5Vq9T.png
*****
&gt; “We’re up over 30% in 2019, over 18% last year and over 21% in the first months of this year,” Donabedian said. “These are unsustainable rates or return. ...Our takeaway is it’s going to get tougher from here. Valuations are somewhat extended and this whole incredibly supportive policy framework is going to get a little less friendly.”
*****
&gt; # Now watch Congress
&gt; Donabedian said it will be important to watch discussions in Congress as it begins to put details around the infrastructure spending and what type of tax increases will be proposed to pay for it.
*****
&gt; “They’re going to start to fill in the blanks on where the money is going to be spent and what taxes and tax rates are going to be written into the legislation,” he said. “It’s the overall corporate tax rate, it’s the tax on foreign earned income, capital gains rates and dividend tax rate. These are big investor related issues.”
*****
&gt; He said the market has been ignoring the tax issue. “Those sort of issues went quiet over the summer but it’s back full bore over the next two weeks. It will get a lot of attention.”
*****
&gt; The tax decisions could have big implications for corporate earnings, which have been a big driver of the stock market’s gains. “One very direct way that could go wrong is if you get a large set of tax increases that go into effect in 2022. That’s a direct hair cut,” he said.

&gt; # Beige Book Decelerates As Delta Impact Widens

&gt; Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve updated its twice-quarterly qualitative assessment of the economy based on conversations with business contacts across the twelve regional districts. For each Beige Book release, we apply a natural language processing algorithm to assess the relative frequency of positive versus negative words, giving us a quantitative comparison of Beige Books over time. As shown in the chart below, our index of Beige Book activity has fallen from record levels recorded back in June to elevated but much more modest levels in September. That's consistent with the Fed's description of ""moderate"" growth thanks to the impact of the Delta variant.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/091021-Beige.png))**

&gt; In the second chart below, we show the relationship between GDP growth and our Beige Book Index from above. As shown, the current reading of our index equates to GDP growth of a bit less than 4% YoY. But keep in mind that extreme base effects are still driving wild YoY GDP readings. With that in mind, the Beige Book Index appears to be showing above-trend but decelerating growth, when accounting for base effects of the extremely low GDP reading from Q2 of 2020.

&gt; # Most Heavily Shorted Stocks

&gt; Over the course of 2021, we have seen some aggressive short squeezes, resulting in turmoil for certain financial institutions and millions in profits for some retail traders. The ""reddit army"" has gone after multiple stocks, most notably Game Stop (GME) and AMC (AMC). Let's dive into the 25 companies in the Russell 3,000 currently with the highest short interest as a percentage of float. Of these 25 companies, only 8 have experienced positive returns in 2021, and 6 have seen their share price half. Since GameStop peaked in late January, 20 of the companies on this list have lost value, and 9 have seen their equity trade down by 50%. Since AMC's peak in early June, 7 companies have seen price appreciation, and zero have seen their value decrease by 50%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/Russell-3000-Highest-SIPF.png))**

&gt; The average short interest as a percentage of float for the entirety of the Russell 3,000 is 3.46%, but certain sectors have much higher proportional short interest than others. Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, and Real Estate have the highest, while Utilities, Financials, and Consumer Staples have the lowest. High levels of short interest is a sign of negative investor sentiment, but certain sectors will consistently have higher figures due to the riskiness of their business models.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/R3000-Sector-Short-interest.png))**

&gt; To dive deeper, let's look at the average short interest in each industry. Retail, Pharma &amp; Biotech, and Consumer Services have the highest levels, while Banks, Tech Hardware, and Utilities have the lowest levels. The average short interest in the retailing industry is more than three times higher than that of banks for companies in the Russell 3,000.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/Industry-avg-SIPF-Russell-3000.png))**

&gt; Although there are many exceptions to the rule, in 2021 equities with higher short interest have generally underperformed the remainder of the Russell 3,000. The average return for equities with short interest between zero and ten percent were higher than that of equities with 33%+ short interest.

&gt; To support this, let's undergo a decile analysis. The stocks in the top 20% in terms of short interest have significantly underperformed the rest of the Russell 3,000 since GME hit its highs. While the equities in the bottom 20% of short interest have averaged a 22.23% return since January 27th (GameStop's top), the top 20% of most heavily shorted stocks have declined by 1.40% on average.

&gt; # Largest 25 Stocks in the S&amp;P 500, Now vs 20 Years Ago

&gt; Yesterday, we took a look at the makeup of the S&amp;P 500's largest 25 companies in 2021 and compared it to that of 10 years ago. Today, we will be extending the study to 2001, twenty years ago right before the 9/11 attacks. On the day before 9/11, the sectors with the largest number of components in the top 25 in terms of market cap were Consumer Staples, Health Care, Technology, Financials, and Communication Services. While all of these sectors still hold a spot in the current top 25 list, the makeup has shifted substantially. Energy and Industrials, which each accounted for 8% of the top 25 companies in 2001, now have zero representation in today's list. Consumer Staples also reduced its count from five to two.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/sector-breakdown-top-25-stocks-now-vs-2001-v2.png))**

&gt; Only four companies that made up the list of top 25 names in September 2001 remain on the list today. Those four companies are Microsoft (MSFT), J&amp;J (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Pfizer (PFE). The average return of these four equities, excluding dividends, is 221.81% with a median of 129.58%. While the turnover of this list has been high over the last 20 years, every member of this list is still in operation today, but two have been undergone mergers (Time Warner &amp; Royal Dutch Petroleum). Interestingly enough, the members of this list have approximately the same proportionate makeup of the S&amp;P 500, with only a 1.89% increase in the weightings of the top 25 stocks now relative to September 2001.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/2001-vs-2021-biggest-comps-SP500.png))**

&gt; The US economy today is far different than it was in 2001. As it has changed, some companies have adapted and experienced massive growth, while others have been left in the dust. Apart from the two companies that are no longer independently publicly traded, the average return of the 25 largest companies from 2001 is 92.94% with a median return of 49.08%. Over that same period, the S&amp;P 500 has returned 310.61%.

&gt; # September Seasonal Pattern: Weakness After Mid-Month

&gt; September is the final month of the third quarter and historically it is essentially tied with August as worst month of the year. Since 1950, September is ranked last for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have fared slightly better, but historical average performance is still negative. Over the last 21 years, September has generally opened tepidly with mixed performance depending on index with Russell 2000 often rising the most through mid-month. However after mid-month, any gains have tended to fade quickly and turn into losses by month’s end. Sizable losses in 2001, 2002, 2008 and 2011 weigh heavily on average performance.

&gt; # September quarterly option expiration week: S&amp;P 500 up 13 of last 18

&gt; September’s option expiration week is up 59.0% of the time for S&amp;P 500 since 1982. DJIA and NASDAQ have slightly weaker track records with gains 53.8% of the time and 56.4% of the time respectively. However, the week has suffered several sizable losses. The worst loss followed the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. In the last eighteen years, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are tied for best record during September’s option expiration week, up thirteen times. Friday had been firm with all three indices advancing every year 2004 to 2011, but S&amp;P 500 has been down eight of the last nine since.

&gt; # What Could Happen The Rest of the Year to Stocks and Bonds?

&gt; This week in the latest LPL Market Signals podcast, Ryan Detrick and Lawrence Gillum discussed global central bank policy, recently weakening economic data, and where stocks and bonds could go the remainder of this year.

&gt; In today’s blog we will focus on their discussion on stocks and bonds.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index was up more than 20% by the end of August for the first time since 1997 and it has made a new high every single month this year so far (9 for 9). Incredibly, it made 53 new highs before August was over, the most ever. Any way you slice it, this year is historic for the bulls.

&gt; The catch (and there’s always a catch) is the S&amp;P 500 hasn’t pulled back 5% all year, with the last 5% pullback last October. Not to mention September is the worst month for stocks the past 10 years, 20 years, and since 1950.

&gt; But history says that great starts to a year tend to see continued strength the final four months. “Looking at the previous top 10 starts to a year ever, the final four months have gained eight times,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “So should we see any seasonal weakness, we’d use it as an opportunity to buy before likely continued strength.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 2021 ranks as the 6th best start to a year ever. The previous top 10 best starts to a year averaged a return of 4.0% the rest of the year, with a very solid median return 5.4%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.8.21-Blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Turning to bonds, we continue to expect higher yields due to the growth and inflation outlook, with a target of 1.75% on the 10-year treasury yield by year end. This of course could pressure bonds, as they trade inversely with yields.

&gt; From a portfolio point of view, we would keep overall interest rate sensitivity muted and favor mortgage-backed securities and short- to intermediate-maturity investment grade corporates. As a result of our higher rates call, we suggest being underweight longer maturity high grade corporates or long-term treasuries, which are more sensitive to rising rates. So sum it up, taking a more of a defensive posture as it relates to interest rate sensitivity makes a lot of sense the remainder of 2021.

&gt; Also, the potential this week for a European Central Bank (ECB) announcement on tapering could push European yields higher, which in turn could push U.S. yields higher as well.

2021-09-02 22:07:37,r/stocks,"PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, September 2, 2021","Stocks once again traded, mixed, this time with the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) modestly underperforming relative to the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) both of switch had a last minute rally to close barely on the green. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed the three major indexes, rising 0.68%. Following the Federal Reserve’s annual Jackson Hole Symposium last week, market participants are anxiously waiting for the August Jobs Report, which will further illuminate the state of the labor market, a key factor in the Fed’s decision-making regarding a potential taper timeline. 

ADP, a leading human services and payroll management company, released their monthly private job report, which estimated that the US gained 374,000 jobs in August, far short of estimates of 600,000, though an improvement over 326,000 last month. Most of the new jobs came from leisure and hospitality, which added 201,000 positions in a somewhat hopeful sign that an industry beset by a labor shortage continues to recover. Education and health services combined to add 59,000, with employment dented by a surge in Delta variant cases. This sets a backdrop for the official August Jobs Report, set to be released on Friday. Economists estimate 756,500 jobs will be added, which would represent a slowdown compared to the 943,000 jobs added in July.

Mike Loewengart, managing director of investing strategy at E-Trade Financial, wrote in a note to clients, “The private payroll numbers have been all over the map during the pandemic. But with so much pressure on improvement on the labor market front coming from the Fed, this could send a signal that jobs growth is stagnating. That’s likely a good thing for the markets, though, as it means easy money policy continues.” 

Members of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially close at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the “substantial further progress mark” the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, “I think that one more good job report if it’s in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.” As I have said multiple times in the past, personally, I remain bullish even during tapering talk, I think the real test for equities will come when interest rate hikes start being discussed.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, August 17, 2021**

Stocks fell firmly on Tuesday, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones retreating from record levels yesterday amid a mixed batch of earnings results from major retailers and new economic data regarding retail sales. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting to hear from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who is scheduled to speak later this week. Market participants will be waiting to see if there is any new information regarding a potential taper timeline. 

Shares of Dow component Walmart (WMT) fell even after the big-box retailer posted second-quarter results that blew past estimates and raised its full-year guidance. Stimulus check spending, strong grocery demand and e-commerce sales helped push U.S. comparable sales excluding gas up by 5.5%, topping estimates but still slowing from last year's 9.9% surge. Home Depot (HD), meanwhile, missed on comparable sales for the second quarter, with these rising 4.5%, way below consensus estimates of a 5.5% increase. 

According to the Department of Commerce, for the month of July, retail sales in the US fell 1.1%, much higher than the drop of 0.3% expected and below the 0.7% increase in June, a sign that economic activity is slowing down, likely to the surge in the coronavirus delta variant and government stimulus drying up. Consumer spending makes up nearly 70% of US GDP, so market participants closely track these reports. 

China released economic data for July that showed growth rates slow down dramatically as the world’s second largest economy battles with summer flooding and the resurgence of coronavirus thanks to the highly contagious delta variant. Industrial production, a gauge of activity in the manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors, grew by 6.4% year-over-year in July, a sharp deceleration from the 8.3% rise in June and below the 7.9% growth expected. Retail sales, a key measurement of consumer sentiment in the world’s most populous nation, grew by 8.5% in July, way below the 12.1% increase in June and missing the 11.5% expected by economists. 

The National Bureau of Statistics noted “the impact of multiple factors including the growing external uncertainties and the domestic COVID-19 epidemic and flooding situation,” according to a release. The bureau added that the “economic recovery is still unstable and uneven.”

Looking ahead, market participants are set to receive the Federal Open Market Committee's July meeting minutes (which are basically notes of what was discussed) on Wednesday, offering more context around how much more amenable central bank officials have become to the notion of tapering their crisis-era asset purchases as the economic recovery takes place. As I have said in the past, I wouldn’t be surprised if there is more discussion about a potential timeline to begin tapering quantitative analysis, though I remain unconcerned. While the markets may react negatively, the real test will be in 2022 when discussions of raising the interest rates are brought to the table.

* The world's largest nonfinancial companies had a record $6.85 trillion in cash on their balance sheets as of the end of the second quarter, according to data from S&amp;P Global Ratings.

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* ALLE
* GRUB
* UVXY

Gapping DOWN:

* TSLA
* HD
* LOW
* FUTU
* BABA
* JD
* LUV
* SAVE
* RBLX

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open a bit lower this morning, as we pull back from ATH levels. Delta variant fears continue to linger, and recovery plays are struggling as a result. HD saw sales slow a bit, and the stock is down in premarket trading. LOW is also down in sympathy. Meanwhile, WMT beat expectations and raised their forecast. The stock is trading flat in premarket at the moment, after recovering after a dip. China continues to tighten its grip on Chinese tech companies, with the purpose of dealing with unfair competition and handling of critical data handling. Chinese stocks are showing weakness in premarket trading, as a result. Lots of uncertainty for the future, and understandably. This could prove to be a good buying opportunity, but the fears of increased regulation are warranted, thus high risk. 

SPY is trading just under 445, and I'm expecting to see some uncertainty in today's trading. Yesterday's session started off a bit choppy before we saw a push to new ATH. If we see weakness today, we could retrace to 443. DIA is in a similar technical level, and could test 354.50 as resistance. QQQ saw some volatility in yesterday's trading, and has seen significant resistance in the 368-370 range. Gold and silver are up a bit this morning, while crude oil is slightly down. B\*\*coin is up a bit this morning, currently trading around 47,000. Could test resistance at 48,000. If we see weakness in the overall market today, I'll be watching how B\*\*coin behaves in relation. Cr\*pto-related stocks are up a bit in premarket trading. Airlines and cruise stocks are seeing weakness in premarket as delta variant fears continue to linger with no near-term end in sight.

2021-08-16 21:46:36,r/stocks,Walmart (WMT) - Golden Cross + ATH + Earnings,"Hey all,

Just saw Walmart flashing up in came up in my screener settings for golden cross for long term golden cross (SMA50 crossing up SMA200) at the end of last week and the last time this happened was on Apr 2020. On average the golden cross only happens once each year and it seems that this year's golden cross happened last week.

Also, WMT is about to reach all time highs and it will be interesting to see if it breakout to the upside or gets rejected and becomes a double top at the key 152-153 level.

Earnings tomorrow and price action this coming week will probably be a defining catalyst as to whether or not the breakout will occur. Through my analysis, there seems to be weak correlation for price action relative to WMT experiencing a EPS beat, but if EPS misses, you can most likely count on the price to decline significantly in the next 7-30 days ([data here](https://hopium.ai/symbol/wmt/catalysts/earnings?filter=price_after_event&amp;limit=-1)) - especially with that double top potential at the ATH. On the bright side, EPS consensus seems to value a beat for tomorrow's earnings by \~3%. It will be interesting to listen in on their upcoming and full year forecast with regards to strong back to school demand and how the delta variant will impact traffic + online sales

I have no positions in Walmart (WMT) but will be looking to play the breakout or rejection as it occurs this week

* NAOV (+27%): Up on continuation from the past few days of trading. I'll be watching price action around the resistance level of 3. 
* ENLV (+17%): Up after Israeli Ministry of Health authorized phase IIb clinical trials for their drug for severe COVID patients. Seeing some weakness in price action at the moment, so I'll want to see that turn around. Premarket high of 13.19.
* DPW (+8%): Up after reporting earnings. Seeing pretty good volume and price actionI'll be particularly interested if it can break and hold over the resistance level of 3. 

Not a whole lot to look at for the momentum watchlist this morning, it will be worth running the screener a few more times before open to see if anything else is moving. 

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open lower this morning, as delta variant fears continue to escalate. We also are seeing a slowdown in global economic growth, and this is worth monitoring closely. China has been reporting weaker economic numbers and outlook, and if delta variant concerns continue to escalate, we could see a similar trend in the US. This week we'll be getting earnings from some major retailers such as WMT, TGT, and HD, and this should help to paint a picture of how the US economy is doing in terms of spending. 

SPY is trading a bit over 444 and we could see some choppiness today after pushing to new ATH on Friday. DIA is trading just under 354 and is in a similar technical position compared to SPY. QQQ is trading a bit over 367. If it sees weakness, I'll be watching action around the 365 support level. Gold and silver are down a bit at the moment, while crude oil is down a bit over 3% at the moment.

Stocks rose modestly in another very choppy session, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) narrowly eking out fresh intraday record highs. The Nasdaq (QQQ) remain just a tick below its previous all-time high. Market participants continue to digest corporate earnings data and new economic reports.

Yesterday’s Weekly Unemployment report showed a third straight drop in filings, an encouraging sign that the recovery in the labor market continues. The report showed new unemployment claims coming in at 375,000, in-line with analyst estimates. Continuing claims came in at 2.866 million, better than the 2.9 million expected and 2.980 million the week prior. 

The Labor Department reported Wednesday that its consumer price index (CPI) rose 5.4% in July from a year earlier, in line with June’s figure and matching the largest jump since August 2008. The government said CPI increased 0.5% on a month-over-month basis, matching a consensus forecast from economists surveyed by Dow Jones.

Core CPI which excludes energy and food, rose by 0.3% last month, shy of a forecasted 0.4% increase and well below June’s rise of 0.9%. The core figure is up 4.3% over the last year, a slight deceleration from June’s 4.5%. Economists often consider core CPI to be a more reliable indicator since it’s insulated from the frequent swings in petroleum and food prices. It’s encouraging to see prices slowly moderate as the economic recovery continues to mature and pent-up consumer demand is increasingly released. 

On the other hand, the producer price index (PPI) came in higher than expected. The producer price index for final demand increased at a 7.8% pace for the 12 months ended July, according to the Labor Department. The July print was faster than the 7.3% pace recorded in June and ahead of the 7.3% rate expected. Prices rose 1% in July, matching the increase in June and higher than the 0.6% increase expected. 

Earlier in the week, the US Senate passed the $1 trillion infrastructure deal in a surprisingly bipartisan manner. The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation’s roads and bridges, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation’s broadband infrastrucutre. The vote, 69-30, was uncommonly bipartisan given the seeming contention the Republicans had for the initial drafts of the infrastructure bill. President Biden said, “This historic investment in infrastructure is what I believe you, the American people, want, what you’ve been asking for for a long, long time.” Mitch McConnell, who earlier in the year publicly declared “100% of my focus is on stopping this new administration” said of the deal, “I was proud to support today’s historic  bipartisan infrastructure and prove that both sides of the political aisle can still come together around common-sense solutions.” The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation’s roads and bridges, bolster public transportation, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation’s broadband and 5G infrastrucutre.

Stocks were mixed today, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) underperforming, while previous laggards like financial, industrial, and energy stocks picked up the slack, driving both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) to fresh, intraday, all-time highs. While the past few weeks have been quite choppy, with concerns surrounding inflation and the coronavirus Delta variant weighing on the minds of investors, the overall market has displayed remarkable strength amid record corporate profits and expectations for economic expansion. Today, market participants were encouraged by the July Job Report, which showed a stronger-than-expected rebound in employment last month.

The Labor Department’s July Jobs Report marked an unexpected upswing in employment, with the economy adding 943,000 jobs to the 845,000 expected. The unemployment rate was 5.4%, also better than the 5.7% expected. With the coronavirus Delta variant forcing some parts of the US to reinstate some pandemic-era measures, like indoor mask mandates, market participants were closely waiting for this unemployment report. Like I said yesterday, this Job Report was a bit of a wild card, with estimates fluctuating widely from 330,000 to the high 900,000s. Earlier in the week a report by ADP suggested private payrolls were much weaker than expected, with only 330,000 private payrolls added versus the 700,000 expected. On the other hand, Bloomberg economists estimated a gain of more than 900,000 jobs. Happy to see the report come in so positive, a great sign, that despite headwinds remaining, the labor market continues to recover. 

So far, 59% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) have reported Q2 earnings, with 88% of these beating analyst expectations, according to FactSet. This quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking one, with corporate earnings growth rate expected to accelerate 85% year-on-year, which would be the biggest jump since the Q4 2009. 

However, it is important to note that, despite beating earnings expectations, a number of these companies have pulled back, with tepid outlooks moving forward overshadowing strong results. Moving forward, given that most companies have so far exceeded pre-pandemic levels and the current quarter has an easy comparison to last year, expectations for growth are inevitably going to moderate. This said, I think the pullback in some stocks following earnings is an overreaction. 

**Highlights**

* The Weekly Unemployment Report came in roughly in-line with analyst expectations
   * First time jobless claims: 385,000 vs 383,000 expected

* The crackdown in China continues… Alibaba (BABA) told investors during a call that their tax rate will balloon to 20% by the end of Q3, according to a report by Bloomberg. This is likely due to the fact that the CCP has removed a 10% preferential tax break given to “key software enterprises”. This is likely to affect other Chinese technology and internet stocks.

He asked what I think of the stock. Ive been watching stock and feel its above fair value for me but for him is a screaming deal. Led me to research companies Ive worked at a holding of.

The ones that trade publicly are:

YUM brands: YUM

would not buy on open market, believe it will do well but not outperform. Id be happy to buy discounted shares however. 

Albertsons: ACI

financials seem terrible, no room for real growth with pretty robust competition. Avoid.

Modivcare Inc: MODV

Stock price running real hot and enjoying a covid high, will probably correct hard. Medical transportation and logistics has been huge with covid but will soon be back to normal and they cant maintain the growth, with a PE of 66 im scared plus so much revenue is based on government contracts  I'm avoiding.

WalMart: WMT

Not going to outperform, never going away. Would buy at discount, wont buy open market.

Dick's:  DKS

their financials seem really good. I dont know how but they are crushing it. The ones local to me dont seem to do much business. But revenue, profits, doing great. Buying back shares to increase stock value and even paying a dividend for icing on the cake. Im contemplating buying some open market after some more DD as this one confuses me and will jump on a discounted share in a heartbeat, which almost pains me to say since that was my least favorite place to work ever.

My current employer is the federal government so their stock is pretty much a bond and those arte pretty lame. Where have you worked you would hold stock in?

Apple is leading the way. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google aren't far behind. The purpose of this post is the look at how much more value the top companies have gained in comparison to to the rest of the market. As of market close today, here's the indices:

&amp;#x200B;

|Index|Price|52-week range|Highs|Lows|Off highs|Off lows|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|S&amp;P 500|$4,358.69|$3,200.05 - $4,393.68|$4,393.68|$3,200.05|\-0.80%|36.21%|
|Nasdaq Composite|$14,631.95|$10,217.31 - $14,803.68|$14,803.68|$10,217.31|\-1.16%|43.21%|
|Dow Jones Industrial Average|$34,798.00|$25,992.28 - $35,091.56|$35,091.56|$25,992.28|\-0.84%|33.88%|
|Russell 2000 Index|$2,234.04|$1,432.57 - $2,360.17|$2,360.17|$1,432.57|\-5.34%|55.95%|

&amp;#x200B;

S&amp;P500, NASDAQ, and Dow are about 1% from its highs while the Russell Index is about 5%. All indices are way off its lows from 52 weeks ago (even more so from the bottom of the 2020 cash). Clearly the indices are doing ok. But what about the stocks in the S&amp;P500?

In this next chart, here's the value companies in the S&amp;P500 have made since 52 weeks ago (again, the gains should be much more than this since the 2020 lows).

**Marketcap valuation gained during the last 52 weeks**

||Top 5|Top 10|Top 20|Top 50|Top 100|Top 250|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$|$4.96T|$6.49T|$7.93T|$10.76T|$14.15T|$18.03T|
|%|23.69%|31.02%|37.87%|51.42%|67.62%|86.14%|

&amp;#x200B;

||Bottom 250|Bottom 100|Bottom 50|Bottom 20|Bottom 10|Bottom 5|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$|$2.9T|$780.77B|$340.88B|$92.3B|$38.79B|$13.11B|
|%|13.86%|3.73%|1.63%|0.44%|0.19%|0.06%|

The total value gained in the S&amp;P500 index since one year ago is $20.93 trillion! The top 5 companies contributed to about 24% of those gains and the top 250 companies contributed to basically all of it (\~86%).

As of right now, the S&amp;P500 index is now valued at $39.38 trillion, so the S&amp;P500 index has doubled in value since a year ago which is absolutely insane. Let's look at the valuations of these companies.

**Valuations of companies right now**

||Top 5|Top 10|Top 20|Top 50|Top 100|Top 250|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$|$9.08T|$12.26T|$15.67T|$21.89T|$27.68T|$34.86T|
|%|23.05%|31.13%|39.8%|55.59%|70.29%|88.51%|

&amp;#x200B;

||Bottom 250|Bottom 100|Bottom 50|Bottom 20|Bottom 10|Bottom 5|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$|$4.52T|$1.18T|$478.81B|$159.71B|$73.03B|$23.64B|
|%|11.49%|3%|1.22%|0.41%|0.19%|0.06%|

&amp;#x200B;

**Top and Bottom Companies off their highs and lows**

||Top 5|Top 10|Top 20|Top 50|Top 100|Top 250|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|off the highs|\-2.56%|\-12.340%|\-9.13%|\-6.86%|\-6.79%|\-7.42%|
|off the lows|54.50%|54.221%|48.67%|47.09%|53.02%|54.03%|

&amp;#x200B;

||Bottom 250|Bottom 100|Bottom 50|Bottom 20|Bottom 10|Bottom 5|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|off the highs|\-11.53%|\-13.56%|\-14.55%|\-16.05%|\-20.23%|\-19.23%|
|off the lows|65.00%|67.48%|75.81%|67.54%|61.85%|56.65%​|

Top 10 includes Tesla, which is about 25% off its highs that's why you see the top 10 is -12% off its highs. Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index. The top 250 aren't doing so bad either. After that, the bottom 250 gets a bit ugly. The smaller caps did gain more overall up until their highs before they retreated.

Now let's look at how much carrying the top companies are doing.

|ADBE|0.74%|$2.92B|0.007%|$5.83B|0.01%|$8.75B|0.02%​|

Every 1% move Apple makes as of now, \~$24 is moved and the S&amp;P500 index moved \~0.06%. A 3% move would impact $72 billion dollars in valuation and has a 0.18% impact on the index. Doesn't seem much but the index is valued at almost $40 trillion dollars. Look at how much of an impact these stocks together make.

&amp;#x200B;

||1% move|2% move|3% move|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Top 5|0.23%|0.46%|0.69%|
|Top 10|0.3%|0.6%|0.9%|
|Top 20|0.391%|0.78%|1.17%|

The top 20 companies can make a 1%+ move if they averaged a 3% increase/decrease.

So what should I get out of this?

* The S&amp;P500 is top heavy - 23% of its valuation comes from the top 5 companies. 55% of its valuation from the top 50 companies. Almost 90% from the top 250 companies.
* S&amp;P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them.
* Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD.
* Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down.
* Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season.

Hope ya'll find this useful. Good luck to all.",96,13,reggiebergst,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/op2ket/the_top_five_us_public_companies_are_carrying_the/,op2ket
2021-07-18 16:37:45,r/stocks,"If you started investing this year, don’t fret.","I know I’ve spoken to people on here in the same situation as me. You started investing at the beginning of 2021 and you’ve been trading sideways since you started. Your portfolio has been jumping between positive and negative all-time. I’m not worried and you shouldn’t be either. 

I would assume that most people finding themselves in this scenario aren’t index fund or “safe” investors. You’re trying to build a high growth portfolio for the long term like I am. 

For reference, here is my portfolio breakdown:

“Safer” steady growers - HON, WMT, ABBV, GE, SONY, CLF, NEE*, and BHVN*. I see NEE and BHVN as safer compared to the other high growth stocks I own. BHVN has a very promising pipeline of drugs and has grown a lot as of late. NEE may be the most promising renewable energy company in the market. 

Mega-cap tech - AAPL and GOOGL.

More speculative, high-growth - BABA, AMD, ZG, NIO, NOK, PSFE, PLTR, SOFI, DKNG, MTZ, ETSY, and STEM.

That’s my portfolio. 22 positions as of now. Out of those, here are the ones I’m currently negative in - BABA, ZG, PSFE, PLTR, SOFI, DKNG, MTZ, and GE. Besides GE, the rest of those are more speculative and more or what I would consider high growth. That’s what has been getting hit as of late. I’m not worried because I am confident these companies will do well long term and the stock prices will inevitably go up. In the short term, I’ll continue to average down through DCA. I’ll grit my teeth through the risks of inflation and rising interest rates. Short term it may be rough, but long term I think it will pay off. I will not sell any of these companies. I may add a few “safer” companies or buy up some VTI, but I think this aggressive approach will be well worth it.",285,74,thelandonblock,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/omrp2w/if_you_started_investing_this_year_dont_fret/,omrp2w

2021-07-02 03:23:55,r/stocks,Building a Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) Portfolio,"I've been struggling these past few months at settling on a portfolio that I was happy with. I am young (23), so I wanted my investments to take advantage of that by being more aggressive with growth. At the same time, I realize that the current market is overextended, and a lot of the companies I really like are trading with a lot of that growth priced in. So, I wanted to put together a portfolio that would satisfy my risk/reward tolerance without having to pay a hefty premium.

The two pieces of advice that I greatly resonate with are:

1. Invest in a great company at a good price &gt; good company at a great price
2. concentration builds wealth, diversification preserves it

So I wanted to keep the number of stocks low (&lt;10) and put my money in companies for which I have high conviction. I started out by first creating a list of sectors that I think are best set up for hyper-growth in the next 10-20 years. For me, those are:

* Tech &gt; Information &amp; Communications / AI, AR, and Automation / Cyber Security
* Financial Services &gt; FinTech
* Healthcare &gt; Health Tech &amp; Genomics
* Consumer Cyclicals &gt; Internet Retail / Gambling
* EVs

Obviously, that list is not exhaustive, but those are the areas I feel the most comfortable with and in which I can see the long-term potential. I used that list as a starting point to look into companies and solidify the ones that will make up my portfolio. Some of the positions are more speculative than others, but I have found to have a compelling enough business model for me to invest in. If you have any criticism or suggestions, please comment below! I'm always looking to learn and discover great companies!

# Portfolio Holdings:

**FB**

For me, this was a no-brainer. The fundamentals are absurdly strong; pretty much no debt with a boatload of free cash. Consistent share buybacks (although not much) and increase in revenue. Outside of the main platform, it owns Instagram and Whatsapp which are incredibly sticky apps. Not to mention all the other projects they have going on (Occulus, FB Watch, etc.). What appealed to me the most was the fact that their ROIC is one of the best compared to the other FAANG stocks. There's also still room for ARPU to grow, especially on the international level. Instagram is also getting reworked to increase monetization. This stock is still undervalued/fairly valued and has, in my opinion, a lot more growth compared to some of the other FAANG companies.

&amp;#x200B;

**SOFI**

I wanted a piece of the fintech space, but the industry leaders PYPL and SQ are way too expensive for me to justify starting a position now. Comparatively, SOFI is trading way below their multiples and there's a lot to like about this company. With SPACs, a lot of the time the fundamentals do not match up to the hype they receive. However, SOFI's Q1 report showed tremendous YOY growth with promising guidance. They also show an increase in the number of users that use more than one of their services, which is an extremely important part of their identity. Now bears may say that this company lacks a moat because traditional banks can just enter the space easily, however, that's not considering one of the most compelling parts of this company, which is their acquisition of Galileo, a payment processor that is integrated with over 90% digital banks in North America and over 70 of the top 100 FinTech companies. So, even as more competitors enter the space, SOFI stands to benefit from that.

Not to mention their management team is stacked with talent. What really sealed the deal for me was the vision of CEO Anthony Noto. In a recent interview, Noto states that the reason SOFI hasn't gone international, despite the interest, is that they wanted to keep refining the product and make sure it can suit the user as best as it can before expanding overseas. This is a CEO that really cares about what they're building and the people who use it.

There's a lot of tailwinds for this company, and even if the fed does increase interest rates in 2022/23, they only stand to benefit.

&amp;#x200B;

**DKNG**

This position hinges on political policy, but I'm optimistic about it given how smooth the process of legalizing online betting in the US has been so far. The balance sheet may not be the cleanest, but companies like these typically spend a lot upfront in the form of CACs, and they've done an amazing job in that regard at making this company a household brand. Q1 2021 reports that monthly unique payers (MUPs) increased 114% yoy.

There's so much growth ahead in the short and long term. Over half the country has legalized betting (in some shape) in 3 years. The gambling market size is predicted to undergo hyper-growth in the next 10 years. Furthermore, DKNG has expressed interest in the esports scene, which is also something that has and will see explosive growth.

With that all said, I don't think the stock is cheap, and there are definitely a lot of risks here, but I believe in what they've done so far and can see a lot of upside in the long term.

&amp;#x200B;

**ABBV**

I was between this and BMY, and I might end up just going 50/50 in both. Great fundamentals, a lot to like. Strong top-line revenue growth yoy and a lot of free cash flow. Share buybacks every year, except for the most recent when they issued shares to raise money for their acquisition. There's some concern that HUMIRA, their most popular drug which makes up about 50% of their revenue, has its exclusivity period ending 2023, but their recent acquisition of Allergen positions them well for the future. ABBV is certainly not a crazy hypergrowth stock, but they still have room for growth and their dividend is king. Especially now, when it's trading at a very reasonable valuation, it's a great time to buy in.

&amp;#x200B;

**BABA**

I'm sure this stock needs no explanation on this sub. I really think this stock, or the likes of TENCHY, belongs in every portfolio that's focused on long-term growth at a reasonable price. So unless you're extremely against Chinese companies and the risk they may present, this is an absolute steal at these prices. In fact, right now most U.S companies are overvalued whereas almost every Chinese stock is undervalued.

&amp;#x200B;

**COIN**

I stayed far away from buying into this company when it IPO'd. Now it has fallen to a pretty reasonable valuation, so I decided to start a small position. I hold a small crypto portfolio myself and although I don't think crypto will replace fiat money, I still see a lot of potential in it long term for a variety of uses. If you don't believe in crypto at all, then it's a lot harder to justify buying into this company.

COIN itself is one of the most popular crypto exchanges and they posted blistering numbers in their 2021 Q1 report. Granted, a lot of that was tied to the initial explosion of crypto in mainstream media, but the conservative projections for the full year of 2021 are still great. Crypto is still in its infancy in terms of mainstream support and use and the potential TAM is massive.

That said in the short term, there will be a lot of volatility with this stock. That's why I'm starting with a very small position, with the intention to add if the numbers and guidance continue to impress. Bear cases made of COIN usually rests on the fact that there is nothing proprietary about COIN or that they depend too heavily on transaction fees, which I fully acknowledge, but they have the name recognition and the biggest userbase, and it'll be up to their management team to make the right moves and continue to innovate. I'm still learning about the crypto space, but there's a lot more than just a means of exchange.

&amp;#x200B;

**CLF**

American steel. Steel futures have been unstoppable lately, with the re-opening and word that an infrastructure deal is in the works, there's a lot to like about steel. News of China pulling back from steel exports also allows American steel to be more competitive in the marketplace. Yet, despite all these catalysts, the prices of companies like CLF are still lagging behind. This is not your typical growth play, and I personally see this as a short-term (6-12 months) position, due to steel's cyclical nature. I'll also admit I got into this a few months before when CLF was sitting at 18 a share. Still, CLF is poised to gain a lot, and quite a lot to like about this company. The management team under Lourenco Goncalves has revitalized CLF, making big acquisitions of AK Steel and ArcelorMittal USA. He's also recently gone and raised Q2 2021 guidance, and there's reason to believe that even that was conservative for how hot the industry is currently. 

If you're interested in learning more about the thesis behind steel, I'd suggest checking out r/Vitards. Anyways, I don't know if I'm going to hold this position for say 10+ years, so I'll be looking to capitalize on some short-term gains and use those profits to either open up a new position or fuel my current investments.

&amp;#x200B;

**TDOC**

This is also a very speculative position, similar to COIN. After the major pullback, I believe TDOC is at a very fair evaluation. Despite posting another quarter without profit, there's a lot to like about this company. They have one of the highest NPS scores, significantly greater than AMZN and APPL, which is something that's very compelling and which is something the balance sheet doesn't reflect. Combine that with the fact that they have captured a big chunk of the market, with healthcare professionals and big institutions, makes the company very, very sticky. Even if it only is the ""Zoom for healthcare,"" the quality is strong enough that users won't just drop it for just any other substitute. 

But it's not just the ""Zoom for healthcare"". The acquisitions it has made, both BetterHelp and Livongo, have amazing implications and have yet to show their full potential on TDOC's balance sheet. There's still so much of the healthcare space that can be innovated, and TDOC is primed to take over.

For right now, I'm OK with TDOC being unprofitable even with the pandemic pushing it along so well. That tells me they're funneling their revenue back into research and development to continue to build up its services and revenue streams.

I also believe that telehealth is still in its infancy, and even though it was massively adopted during COVID, that only accelerates its long-term use and adoption by a little bit. It's going to take a while before it becomes sophisticated enough for people to see the value. This is a long-term play to which I will be consistently adding.

&amp;#x200B;

**BARK**

Barkbox features in delivering monthly care packages for dogs on a subscription basis. This is something that's not as hyped as EVs, but pet care is a fast-growing market that sees more spending each year. In fact, quarantine boosted the number of pet owners in the US dramatically. Barkbox has seen tremendous yoy growth in revenue and subscriptions, with a CAGR, gross margins, and a returning customer rate that beats the industry leader CHWY as well as other popular brands. BARK has made a lot of partnerships with the likes of AMZN, WMT, TGT, etc., and looks to continue to expand vertically in the space of dog hygiene/medicine/food. All of this while trading at a much lower multiple than the other big pet care brands. 

The management team is fantastic. Manish Joneja, CEO of BARK, has 2 decades of experience as director of Amazon global exports and expansion and 5+ years on eBay as product lead. Carly Strife and Henrik Werdelin have been featured in Forbes 30 under 30 and Top 100 Most Creative/Top 100 people in tech, respectively. 

The bear case of this company is that they have no moat, but their customer retention speaks a lot to brand loyalty and satisfaction. CHWY also has a box subscription service for dogs, however, it's nowhere close to as popular as BARK. BARK is also expanding internationally, starting first with Australia.

Will it get to where CHWY is? That part isn't clear and it depends on how well BARK is able to build on what it has and expand what it has to offer. But the stock has a lot of room to run given the current valuation, and the product is sticky enough to either allow them to succeed or be a target for an acquisition.

Stocks traded mostly sideways today, managing to mostly hold on to recent gains, despite new data on consumer confidence coming in below expectations. After the volatility experienced in the first few weeks of May, recent price action has been more encouraging to me. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.2% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.15% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.22% down. 

Today, the Conference Board (a non-profit research organization), released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected. The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 117.2 in May from 117.5 in April. However, on the positive side, April's reading was the highest since February 2020, before the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 119.5. 

A separate report by Standard &amp; Poor’s said that its S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index posted an annual gain of 13.2% in March up from 12% in February and marking 10-straight months of acceleration in home prices. The results far outpaced analysts’ expectations of a 12.5% annual gain, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. According to a recent Reuters poll, U.S. house prices are forecast to outpace GDP growth and consumer inflation — rising at a blistering pace to average 10.6% this year, almost double the 5.7% predicted in February. With demand rising faster than supply, it is not surprising to see home prices surging forward, with economists expecting the growth to taper once supply rises to meet demand. Total housing inventory at the end of April was 1.16 million units, down 20.5% from one year ago — the lowest level since NAR started tracking homes for sale in 2011. Inventory, however, was up 10.5% from March, an indication that homebuilding is picking up.

Today, members of the Federal Open Markets Committee reiterated their stance that the Fed was not yet worried about rising prices forcing the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.”

After weeks of volatility, stocks rallied today as fears over rising inflation forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy tempered. As I have said for weeks, there are several reasons I thought the initial reaction to the April Consumer Price Index, which saw the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) lose 4% in three trading days, was overdone and I am glad to have taken advantage of the dip particularly in technology stocks. The SPY closed 1.01% and is only 3 points away from its all-time high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.68% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed .56% higher. 

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”.

Moreover, while the market was shaken by the April Consumer Index, as has been reiterated in the recap before, the Federal Reserve has consistently said they are looking towards significant progress in the labor market before any significant adjustments to monetary policy are considered. In the Federal Reserve’s April meeting minutes, “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals”.  Jerome Powell and other monetary officials have reiterated several times that they want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before major adjustments to policy are considered. The April Job Reports showed only 266,000 jobs added back to the economy, widely missing analyst expectations and marking a sharp deceleration in job growth from March, bolsters that argument.

On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also said a number of participants suggested” that as the economy continues to quickly, “it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase”, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, it’s important to note the meeting toke place before the release of the April Jobs report, which greatly bolsters Powell and other monetary officials' argument that the labor market remains below the Fed’s targets and roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic times. onth. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about.

Michael Jones, CEO of Caravel Concepts said, “I do think it's been a pretty healthy sideways chop. It's taken out some of the speculative excess. The biggest pullbacks have been in some of the most pricey names. That all feels very healthy to me.”

The stock market opened deep in the red but managed to climb throughout the session to pare much of the losses. For example, the Nasdaq (QQQ) opened 1.73% down but managed to close the day 0.12% up. Despite the market declining modestly the last three days, it is encouraging to see volatility decreasing this week  after the wild swings the market experienced in the last few weeks. As said before, I thought the initial sell-off after the April Consumer Price Index was released was overblown for several reasons and am encouraged by this week’s price action.  

Leadership in equity markets has see-sawed between cyclical and value stocks and technology stocks, as market participants weigh the prospects for a strong economic rebound as the US economy continues to reopen with the possibility that the pick-up in activity may generate a surge in inflation. After leading the market higher in April, in the last month, the Nasdaq is down 4.77% compared to 0.79% down in the S&amp;P 500. In my view, this dip could represent a great opportunity given earnings have been extremely strong and many companies have significantly raised guidance moving forward. 

The Federal Reserve released its April Meeting Minutes (basically a written record of what happened in the meeting), which said that “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals” and reiterated, for like the millionth time, that they did not believe a near-term adjustment of monetary policy was needed. Much of the recent volatility in the market is due to investors afraid that a surge in inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy, so hopefully this commentary by the Fed can calm things down. [Read the entire meeting minutes here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210428.pdf)

However, it is important to note, the minutes covered the meeting before the release of the April Jobs Report, which came in much weaker than expected (which bolsters the Fed’s argument that employment remains far from their goal) and the Consumer Price Index, which showed a greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices. That said, the recent reports are extremely unlikely to change the Fed’s view given Powell and other monetary officials have said they expect any inflation to be “transitory” and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before adjustments to the current policy are considered.

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Moreover, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” Finally, the April Job Report, which showed the economy gained only 266,000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March, bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy.

2021-05-09 14:43:18,r/stocks,Stocks to hold forever?,"Hi I’m turning 19 soon and I have invested 90% of my savings since last year to have a combined net worth of little more than 13k. I currently live abroad but I expect to go back  in less than a year. I use a foreign brokerage that charges me for all the transaction and exchange rate, which is quite high. So I refrain from trading as much as possible, meaning I have to hold shares for a long time to make a sizable gain. In practice, a 2-2.5% gain would break even due to currency exchange fees and taxes mostly.

My main question is if these stocks are good enough to hold for at least 5 years. Idk if I’ll change my brokerage once I go back to the states or not, but if I decide to continue to use it I don’t have to sell anything. I currently hold the following:

- AMZN, GOOGL, AAPL, MSFT, PYPL, TSLA, HD, LOW, WMT, KO, VIG, JNJ, PG, ABT, COST, SBUX, TGT, ICLN

2021-04-27 14:49:59,r/stocks,What is going on with stock valuation right now?,"Tl;dr I want to buy stocks but everything has a P/E ratio double that of what is historically normal, what is going on and why are value ETFs long on so many overvalued positions?

Hey all, newbie question here:

I’m new to investing and learning the basics of stock valuation. The way I understand it, you start by looking at a company’s price to earnings ratio, or P/E. From moneychimp.com:

&gt; Although discounted cash flows is the correct way to value a company, people naturally like to use simpler rules of thumb. The P/E ratio is the most popular because it's easy to understand. **If you buy stock at a P/E ratio of 15, say, then it will take 15 years for the company's earnings to add up to your original purchase price - 15 years to ""pay you back"".** That's assuming that the company is already in its ""mature"" stage, where earnings are constant.

It goes on to say that you may want to buy at a high PE ratio if you expect earnings to keep increasing. 

My understanding is also that the average P/E ratio historically has been somewhere in the ballpark of 13-15. Anything below that, all other fundamentals being equal, is considered a healthy buy.

Now I’m looking into large cap ETFs (I don’t have any positions yet) and checking the valuation of their top holdings and.... I’m seeing P/E ratios *way above* the historical average. Just some examples from this morning:

AAPL: 36.42

GOOG: 37.20

MSFT: 38.96

WMT: 29.06

JNJ: 28.99

AMZN: 81.51 ?!!

TSLA: 1,158.65 ??!!?!

I get that the highest values here are tech, which may have a strong expectation to keep growing, but Tesla with a P/E ratio in the thousands? Is this normal? Is this the result of massive money printing going straight to Wall Street and inflated stock prices relative to consumer goods (and thus relative to earnings)? What is going on?

Basically the last few months I've been trying to buy a few stocks a week of dividend stocks, trust me...I don't plan to do that whole live off them thing, i'd rather bet on growth, but having some seems like a great idea.  That's what a lot of those random capital stocks are.  Right now I'm up to about $50 a month from dividends which I am reinvesting.  My main concern is that moving forward past the summer, norweigein and spirit will even out (I do think it still has room to gain a bit) and I will be clueless what to do besides sell my shares...by that point ill have held for more than a year for tax purposes.

My goal is to continue to add maybe 100 bucks a week, maybe 50 into dividend/blue/whatever and have 50 a week for growth/tech/ or take some shots at more options.  (i have 1 long term with norweigein currently that I just added)

2021-03-25 17:18:10,r/stocks,WMT DD best stock in my portfolio?,"\*disclaimer: this is my first DD... I'm taking time out of my office job to hear thoughts about my analysis.

Looking at my portfolio that I built in the past 4 months, WMT seems like the most undervalued stock.

I am not talking about any get rich quick stocks. Looking at you TSLA, PLTR, NIO, GME. (although I am invested $20k in these stocks and am about 20% down)

# 1. Why it will win in the next few years

The market volatility is here. We don't know if it's going to stay, but I am unsure about investing heavily in tech. I want a company that can weather the storm. Grocery/food retailer, especially low-cost chain, seems like a great place to invest in since their business model will bring even more customers in challenging times. The $1400 stimie is a boost that will flow into this sector while we move past the pandemic. 'WIN' here doesn't mean doubling stock price in the next few years. 'WIN' is beating the market. My goal is 4%+ annual.

# 2. On-line business model

Let's be frank here. Walmart doesn't have the greatest online presence. They are trying their best with Walmart+, but it's not there yet. Good news is that I don't think their online presence is 'priced-in', which means that the current valuation of the company doesn't account for how big it can actually get. The company still makes great revenue and margin in the space and there's room for growth.

# 3. Current valuation

The stock is currently down about 10% since the ATH (all time high) in Dec 2020. Not gonna lie, grocery stores did get a boost during the pandemic since a lot of people cooked more meals at home, but look at the 50 day moving average. The stock moved higher faster than anticipated, but it's trending well with the average line in the right direction. In the past 5 years, the stock has dipped below 50-day moving average a very few times.

While we are at it, let's look at some of the fundamentals:

PE: 28.14

PS: 0.67

PB: 4.66

These are some of the lowest number I see in my portfolio right now.

# 4. Is there a bear case?

From what I can see, very little. If WMT is down, I am pretty sure the whole market will be down. I also don't foresee them making poor business decisions in the coming future that will cause WMT to inverse the market growth.

# 5. Is there a better alternative?

Maybe Costco? but Walmart fundamentals are better with higher performing chart data. (I own Costco as well).

TLDR: WMT has solid fundamentals, is down 10% for no reason, is seriously undervalued right now, there's no bear case, no rising competition, potential huge growth with online presence, it's a BUY.

I am 23 and just started my Roth IRA in February and so far have a little over $4,300 deposited (still using 2020 as the deposit year don’t worry)     I am also focused on dividend growth investing as I view it as the safest option I’m willing to do and since it’s my retirement account I do want some safety in it. I also don’t want to just toss it into an index fund as I personally believe I’ll be able to pick the best stocks from each sector (or at least the top 25% in each sector) and outperform the general market as a whole. I also enjoy doing research on companies as it lets me stay up to date on what is driving our society from the business perspective and juxtapose that to my personal perspective. I also have a ton of time to listen to ER’s and read reports done by third parties as I’m often driving long distances for either work or to see friends. There isn’t a day that I’m not looking into at least one of my holdings or potential holdings. I enjoy it and that’s why I’m not doing an ETF (I also do have some ETF’s again just for safety’s sake). My portfolio by sector:

Communication services: VOD, DTEGY. (Going to be adding DIS and either T or VZ)

Consumer Discretionary: NKE, HBI. (Going to be adding MCD, and YUM)

Consumer Staple: MO, KO, PEP. (Going to be adding WMT, BTI, PG, and either COST or TGT)

Energy: KMI, OKE (going to be looking to add either CVX or XOM depending which is doing more for green energy, same for picking between RDS and BP)

Financials: AFL, C. (Need to do more research into this sector tbh, any suggestions would be welcome)

Health Care: ABBV. (Going to be adding MDP, JNJ, LLY, and either MRK or MRNA)

Industrials: EMR. (Going to be adding UNP, MMM, and maybe WM, then either RTX or LMT)

Materials: NUE, STLD. (Going to be adding APD. Would love to hear some other suggestions for me to look into)

Real Estate: O, STAG. (Looking at maybe adding one or two more REITS, open to suggestions)

Tech: IBM. (Going to add AAPL, MSFT, and GOOGL, maybe AMD.  Would love to hear what your tech dividend payers are)

Utilities: VST, AQN. (Going to be adding PEG, NEE, and would love to find maybe one or two more)

This quarter will blowout expectations, the stock has completely flown under the radar on low volume, options are dirt cheap and average price target is $327 representing over 25% upside, 500%+ for March options assuming the price moves back to where it was right before last earnings.

EDIT: One day after my post Goldman Sachs upgrades FDX to $356 price target with buy rating [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/FDX/?RegistrationCode=SocialMedia-direct&amp;utm\_source=GeneralSocialMedia&amp;utm\_medium=Social&amp;utm\_campaign=SocialMedia](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/FDX/?RegistrationCode=SocialMedia-direct&amp;utm_source=GeneralSocialMedia&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=SocialMedia)

Below are bulletpoints for DD on FDX, which should run into ER next week. My last DD was buying puts on $snow that was trading near $400 and now $230 today, resulting in 200%+ put profits ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kina26/snow\_massive\_dilution\_incoming\_easy\_put/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kina26/snow_massive_dilution_incoming_easy_put/)).

* Fedex reports earnings next Thursday, this quarter includes:
   * Record Black Friday shipping
   * Record Cyber Monday shipping
   * Vaccine shipping and just inked deal to deliver J&amp;J vaccine
   * Record Holiday season shipping
      * This was extended from normally  Jan 1st to Jan 19th, almost 3 more weeks of extended excessive shipping
   * Huge 5% surcharge on all packages that started on January 4th that will be permanent, this will help offset increased costs ([https://www.freightwaves.com/news/most-recent-fedex-pricing-surcharges-feel-permanent](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/most-recent-fedex-pricing-surcharges-feel-permanent))
      * Many retailers complaining during earnings that they saw a significant uptick in shipping costs
   * Increased global footprint and TNT efficiency gains with workforce reduction, FDX should be handling most global vaccine deliveries too
   * Inked a massive deal with Walmart to handle their returns, this bodes well for future revenue steams ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-wmt-unveils-returns-called-151303675.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-wmt-unveils-returns-called-151303675.html))
* FDX is INSANELY CHEAP. Forward P/E of 13.79, that is roughly HALF of the SP500 with a very low P/S of .9 and attractive PEG of .99
* Yes it is a bit of a boomer stock, the benefit is that there is low volume that is keeping options cheap and stock price low. A blowout earnings should move the stock up very quickly like we saw in q2 and q3 last year.
* Current stock price target is $326 representing over 25% upside in the stock and easily 200%+ for options depending on expiration and strike.
* The above sets up Fedex for a MASSIVE beat on earnings next week and analyst estimates are VERY low. On the last ER call, the CEO noted it was their best quarter ever, first time surpassing $20B and this upcoming quarter will be even better.
   * Here is the kicker, with this massive amount of good news I just mentioned, the stock has gone DOWN over 13% since the last ER.
   * More so, the average Q3 estimate was $4.01 and FDX beat at an incredible $4.83 with massive surprise. Q4 average estimate is lowered by almost 20% to $3.33 when this is expected to be their best quarter ever from yahoo finance. This lowered analyst estimate is due to expectation of costs rising but the amount of added revenue should offset the cost which means the earnings surprise this quarter should be even bigger
      * Why did FDX sell off since last blowout ER? This was because they offered no guidance and the market punished FDX unnecessarily for it.
* Ecommerce shipping volume is up significantly, isn't stopping anytime soon and many analysts underestimate the double-ship benefit FDX gets from online retailers standardizing free return shipping.
* I suspect this will run up into earnings next week, March 19th $270 are only $6, that represents a bit more than a 5% move from now to after earnings. This should run to that right before ER if not more, then if ER is a blowout you should see the stock gap back up to $300 where it was in Q4. If so, that would be almost a 500% profit.

2021-03-03 18:46:56,r/stocks,"Should you chase financials and industrials, etc?","i have a heavy tech weighted portfolio and while I'm not overly worried I'm wondering if I should be adding JPM and BAC and more industrials to my portfolio or maybe even just adding to my Total Market index.

I realize people are running scared from tech now due to various reasons and the rising 10 yr.

I'm in it though for at least 10 years or more.  Should I be worried about tech and chasing recent market rotations?  I thought that wasn't the thing to do? I feel like I'd be betraying my tech 😆!!  Just joking.

I also see that on average banks and industrials have been rather bad performers for over a decade.

I realize they're ""beat up"", but why would people be moving their money into banks if they don't return much??

Is it that they ""have no where else to put their money"" when rotating from tech?

I realize also it's mostly the big money or smart money that moves the market and not small timers like me.

So should I just hold my tech?

I'm not just tech though, I'm diversified.

Here are some holdings for example.

Indexes about 18% of portfolio combined

 FSKAX AARK VTWG FDIS FSPTX


Stocks. About up to 5% each

AAPL MSFT make up 18% combined.

Up to 5% each.

I've actually kind of made my mind up on HON not being worth it, but what about WMT?

2021-02-26 13:59:10,r/stocks,Friday 26 February 2021: A discount bot I have created.,"Friday 26 February 2021

*Live Updates*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:**

* My discount bot to help Reddit. It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.
* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.
* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.
* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.
* There are a lot of SPY500/""boomer"" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.
* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.
* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement
* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only
* This is a one man bot.

**Bot Overview**:

It's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits. Backtesting has not been done, do not YOLO your life savings into whatever stated risking it all.  Rather use this as a side tool.

**Key:**

* Penny stocks are very risky.
* Pharma companies are very risky.
* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.
* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.
* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).
* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.
* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.
* Take the ""Calls"" as very discounted, and ""Potentially A Call"" as somewhat discounted.
* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.
* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.
* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.

The current P/E is good too (for these days). Finances look great as well, revenue/income is growing.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-18-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Dow set to drop as Walmart declines on disappointing earnings

&gt; * U.S. stock futures fell Thursday, after Dow stock Walmart dropped 4.5% in the premarket on disappointing earnings. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday erased a 180-point loss and ended 90 points higher for another record close. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq closed slightly lower for the second straight session. The S&amp;P 500 pared losses after minutes from the Fed’s last meeting signaled easy monetary policy for longer with the economy nowhere close to pre-coronavirus levels.

&gt; * The Labor Department is set to release its weekly jobless claims report at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the opening bell. Economists expect 773,000 new filings for unemployment benefits for last week. That would be down 20,000 from 793,000 initial claims the prior week, which saw little relief from declining Covid cases.

*****

&gt; # 2. Walmart missed on earnings, beat on revenue; CEO to boost wages

&gt; * Trying to turn pandemic gains into sustained momentum and higher profitability, Walmart on Thursday before-the-bell reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.39 per share, which fell short of estimates. Revenue grew by 7.3% to a better-than-expected $152.1 billion. The big-box retailer’s e-commerce sales in the U.S. grew by 69% and its same-store sales in the U.S. grew by 8.6%. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said the company will boost the wage of U.S. workers, raising the average for hourly employees to above $15 per hour.

*****

&gt; # 3. What to expect from GameStop hearing with Robinhood, Citadel, Reddit CEOs

&gt; * The heads of Robinhood, Reddit, Citadel and Melvin Capital, will be in Washington for Thursday’s highly anticipated GameStop hearing, which is scheduled to begin at noon ET in the House Financial Services Committee. According to prepared remarks, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman will testify that no significant activity on WallStreetBets last month was driven by bots or foreign agents. Keith Gill, the Reddit and YouTube trading star known as “Roaring Kitty,” will defend his social media posts that helped spark a mania in GameStop shares.

*****

&gt; # 4. How Texas power grid failed and what could stop it from happening again

&gt; * More than 500,000 households in Texas are still without power Thursday morning, according to poweroutage.us, following Sunday night’s historic cold and snow that caused the state’s worst blackouts in decades. Millions of people were in the dark at the height of the crisis, which was caused by a confluence of factors. Officials are already calling for investigations. Experts said there are a number of steps that Texas can take to combat future problems, including weatherizing equipment and increasing the amount of excess supply needed to meet peak power demand.

*****

&gt; # 5. U.S. life expectancy drops a year in pandemic, most since WWII

&gt; * Life expectancy in the U.S. dropped a staggering one year during the first half of 2020 as the pandemic caused the first wave of coronavirus deaths. Minorities suffered the biggest impact, with Black Americans losing nearly three years and Hispanics, nearly two years, according to preliminary estimates Thursday from the CDC. “You have to go back to World War II, the 1940s, to find a decline like this,” said Robert Anderson, who oversees the numbers for the CDC. It’s already known that 2020 was the deadliest year in U.S. history, with deaths topping 3 million for the first time.

I'm new to fundamentals so any tips would be appreciated.

I assume things like P/B values can almost be overlooked since it is very unlikely that the company would ever liquidate and you would get some $ amount per share, where P/E would be one of the biggest things to look at because that is what the share price is most closely correlated to.

Are there others that you don't or do really pay attention to with large companies like this?

# **Stimulus prospects could boost the stock market and interest rates in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/stimulus-prospects-could-boost-the-stock-market-and-interest-rates-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; The prospects of a big government spending program could continue to boost the stock market and put upward pressure on interest rates in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Earnings season is beginning to wind down, but some big names have yet to report.
*****
&gt; Walmart’s earnings on Thursday should provide a good window into the consumer, as should the government’s retail sales report for January, also expected Wednesday.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve on Wednesday afternoon releases minutes from its last meeting, and investors will dig into those for any insight into the central bank’s view on inflation.
*****
&gt; # Two dominant themes amid stimulus prospects
&gt; Inflation and rising interest rates have been two dominant themes for investors recently and have become increasingly so as the market has upgraded its view of how much fiscal coronavirus stimulus could be signed into law.
*****
&gt; “The market is waiting to see how big the package is going to be. It’s going to be important. They can get it through reconciliation,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
*****
&gt; Krosby said that Democrats could pass the stimulus under budget reconciliation, which means they could approve it with a simple majority instead of relying on negotiations with Republicans.
*****
&gt; Some in the markets had anticipated a package of $1 trillion or less if there was a negotiated deal, but that now looks unlikely. Strategists have changed their view on the proposed $1.9 trillion package.
*****
&gt; “There is less pushback to President Biden’s proposed stimulus from moderate Democrats than we expected, so a price tag of around $1.5 trillion seems likely, which is higher than we initially thought,” noted Cornerstone Macro policy analysts.
*****
&gt; They say they expect a bill to come to the floor during the week of Feb. 22, and that it could become law by the first week of March. Investors will stay focused on its progress through Congress.
*****
&gt; Market pros expect the bigger the spending package, the larger the pop will be in economic growth in the near term. That has helped send Treasury yields, which move opposite price, to higher levels.
*****
&gt; It has also increased concerns about inflation.
*****
&gt; # Inflation and rising yields
In the past week, the 10-year yield — a key benchmark — touched 1.2% for the first time since March. It reached that level briefly early in the week but returned to it in the final hour of trading Friday.
*****
&gt; Yields are rising on optimism for an improving economy, but also as inflation expectations also move higher.
*****
&gt; “If you think about the big drivers, they’re related - vaccines, stimulus and inflation,” said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo Securities. “If there’s more talk out of D.C. about moving the stimulus package forward, that sets the stage for yields to go up.”
*****
&gt; The market is concerned about the economy running hotter, since it could be a trigger to change Fed policy.
*****
&gt; At the same time, the Fed has said it would tolerate inflation above its 2% target.
*****
&gt; Krosby of Prudential Financial said the market will also pay attention to the producer price index Wednesday even though it is not typically a big factor.
*****
&gt; “Because there’s such a debate on inflationary trends, I know the CPI [consumer price index] came in comfortable, but the producer price index is coming in and we’ll see if that has eased,” she said.
*****
&gt; “Obviously supply chains are being reestablished and inventories are building,” said Krosby.
*****
&gt; Consumer inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.4% in January.
*****
&gt; # Housing statistics
Housing data is also dominant on the calendar in the holiday-shortened week.
*****
&gt; The National Association of Home Builders releases its housing market index data on Wednesday, a measurement of sentiment around market conditions for new home sales.
*****
&gt; On Thursday, the government will issue data on pending home sales and building permits. Finally, the National Association of Realtors will release existing home sales data on Friday.
*****
&gt; Upcoming hearing on GameStop and short squeezes
Stocks were higher in the past week, with energy, tech and financials as the best performers. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.2%, ending the week at 3,934.
*****
&gt; There were some market hot spots, like cannabis shares which became the latest target of the Reddit trading community. The stocks shot higher Wednesday, adding to already lofty gains in recent weeks before giving up some of those gains.
*****
&gt; Investors will also be focused on the Thursday hearing before the House Financial Services Committee on the wild trading recently in GameStop and other heavily-shorted names.
*****
&gt; Robinhood’s CEO is expected to testify, as are executives from Melvin Capital Management and Citadel.
*****
&gt; The frenzied activity in some small and shorted stocks has raised concerns about the market becoming overheated. But Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, said the broader market’s advance is intact.
*****
&gt; “Overall, it’s a bull market. I think the steadiness of the advance is underappreciated,” Wald said. He said the market technicals are healthy. Breadth is broad-based and there’s cyclical leadership.
*****
&gt; “The low-volatility, high-dividend paying sectors are at risk,” said Wald. Utilities and consumer staples stocks, which both fit that category, were lower on the week.
*****
&gt; The market was also awaiting the outcome of the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, and it is not expected to react.

&gt; # Presidents' Day Seasonality

&gt; The US equity market will be closed on Monday in observance of the Presidents' Day holiday. Since 1971 when the Uniform Monday Holiday Act set the third Monday in February, rather than on George Washington's birthday (February 22nd) as the Federal holiday, equity market performance during the week of Presidents' Day has been pretty mixed. From the Friday before President's Day through the Friday after, the S&amp;P 500 has traded higher half the time for an average decline of 5 bps. Taking a closer look, in the chart below we show the median returns by day for each trading day in Presidents' week. Tuesday and Thursday have both averaged declines of 13 bps and 7 bps, respectively. Wednesday averages flat performance but the S&amp;P 500 has only been higher 40% of the time. Despite weakness throughout most of the week, equities have tended to catch a bid by week's end with an average 6 bps gain on Friday with a move higher 58% of the time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021221-Presidents-Day3f.png))**

&gt; In the charts below, we show the average intraday performance of the S&amp;P 500 during Presidents' Day week since 1983 when our intraday data begins. We also include looks for years when the S&amp;P 500 was up and down YTD headed into the holiday. Again, the general pattern has been a steady drift lower until Friday when the S&amp;P 500 has tended to rebound. We would note that the Friday rebound is not an all-day event. As shown, performance is pretty flat in the first several hours of trading with the biggest ramp higher occurring in the final of hours of tradings. That pattern is also consistent for both up and down years, though, in years that the S&amp;P 500 was down YTD headed into the holiday there was a bit of a rebound midweek which was reversed by the end of the week.

&gt; # Trading After Presidents’ Day Weekend Continues to be Weak

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/902779bf6e4c3920c0a6e594303d1963/f9c2be89a4714ce6-96/s500x750/313ae18652b5c66a140a47602ee5649c59baeee7.jpg))**

&gt; In a recent post we looked at the improving trend of market performance ahead of Presidents’ Day weekend. However, the two days after still display a fair amount of red. Since 1990, Tuesday after Presidents’ Day has been strongest for the S&amp;P 500 with 18 gains and 13 losses for median gain of 0.12% but with an average loss of –0.23%. DJIA also has more gains than losses on the Tuesday after, but NASDAQ is a net loser down 18 of 31 years with and average loss of –0.49% and a median loss of –0.11%.

&gt; Wednesday is all red for all three major averages. NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 have more losses, but DJIA has a larger average loss. On the Wednesday after the Presidents’ Day holiday DJIA is down 16 of 31 with an average loss of –0.07% and a median decline of –0.10%. S&amp;P 500 is down 18 of 31, average –0.02%, median –0.10% and NASDAQ is down 17 of 31, average –0.01%, median –0.09%.

&gt; # Why Bulls Will Like The Year Of The Ox

&gt; “Bulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.” Old Wall Street saying.

&gt; The Chinese New Year (often called the Lunar New Year) will kick off Friday, February 12, and with it will begin the Year of the Ox. Although we would never suggest investing based on the zodiac signs—it is important to note that the Year of the Ox has historically been quite strong for equities. Not to mention we are saying goodbye to the year of the Rat. Good riddance to the Rat, as the last two years of the Rat were 2008 and 2020, not the best years for many reasons!

&gt; Since the Chinese New Year typically starts between late-January and mid-February, we looked at the 12-month return of the S&amp;P 500 Index starting at the end of January dating back to 1950. And wouldn’t you know it? The Year of the Ox has been up more than 13% on average (with a median advance of nearly 18%); suggesting bulls are smiling indeed!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “The year of the Ox is the second of the 12 animal signs of the Chinese zodiac, and the Ox is considered a symbol of diligence, persistence, and honesty. Equity returns indeed are quite persistent during the Ox, as it is the third best return out of the 12 Zodiac signs,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; The LPL Chart of the Day shows how all the 12 Zodiac signs have done historically, with the Goat, Tiger, and Ox as the best, while the Rooster and Snake have been the worst.

&gt; We want to stress that no one should invest purely based on the zodiac signs. This relationship is random and the sample size is small. Still, here’s hoping that the Year of the Ox plays out well for the bulls once again!

&gt; # Short Interest Update

&gt; Yesterday, bi-weekly short interest data was released for the period ending January 30th. In the chart below, we show the Russell 3000 broken up into deciles based on short interest as a percent of the float at the end of 2020 and these decile's stock's median change in short interest from then to yesterday's release. As shown, with the short squeeze episode playing out in the second half of January, the stocks that came into 2020 the most heavily shorted have seen the biggest declines in short interest. That decile of what had been the most heavily shorted names has seen short interest as a percent of float fall for a median of 2.65 percentage points. Deciles two and three have similarly seen sizable declines, though, they are far smaller than those of the most shorted stocks. On the other hand, the decile of the least shorted stocks is the only one that has seen the median short interest reading move higher since the end of 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Deciles-F.png))**

&gt; In the table below, we show the stocks that currently have the highest short interest as a percent of float. After the historic move higher, short squeeze poster child GameStop (GME) is no longer the Russell 3000's most heavily shorted name! Having dropped over 100 percentage points since the start of the year, only 42.61% of shares are now short compared to 43.57% for Gogo (GOGO); currently the most shorted stock in the index. GOGO has actually seen its shorts come off a bit this year as well but that decline has been far more modest of only a little more than one percentage point. Of the other stocks in the index, only Tanger Outlets (SKT) and Dillard's (DDS) also currently have more than 40% of the float sold short.

&gt; On the January 27th closing high, GME was up 1,744.53% year to date. But with the short squeeze unwinding, the stock has fallen over 86%. Others of this cohort have similarly seen big reversals of their earlier surges. For example, National Beverage (FIZZ) had doubled YTD at the time of the GME peak, but since then it has been cut by 33.78%. Not all of these have been losers since the pinnacle of short selling though. Fulgent Genetics, have similarly seen big gains of over 30%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Current-High.png))**

&gt; Given GME came into the year with an absurd number of shares sold short, the squeeze has resulted in it being the biggest decliner in terms of short interest of any Russell 3000 stock. Short interest as a percentage of float has fallen over 100 percentage points YTD. The next biggest drop came from BigCommerce Holdings (BIGC) and Dillard's (DDS) which both saw larger than 50 percentage point drops. Of the rest of the top twenty biggest decliners, a baker's dozen have seen short interest drop by at least 20 points. Additionally, of these stocks that have seen short interest fall the most, only three—nCino (NCNO), Berkeley Lights (BLI), and 3D Systems (DDD)—now have a single-digit short interest as a percent of float.

&gt; Given the massive short squeezes, there are far more stocks that now have a lower short interest as a percent of float than at the start of the year. In fact, of the Russell 3000 stocks, 1887 have seen declines in short interest compared to only 1146 that have seen an increase. In the table below, we show the twenty stocks to have seen the biggest increases in SIPF since the start of the year. As shown, there is only one, International Game Technology (IGT), that has seen short interest rise by double digits since the end of 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Increase.png))**

&gt; Retailers notably dominate the list of stocks with the biggest declines in short interest. To quantify this, in the chart below we show the aggregate number of shorted shares as a percent of total float for each industry group as of the most recent short interest data and the end of 2020. As shown, just as it was at the start of the year, retailers remain the most heavily shorted industry group, but it has greatly improved with only 5.86% short compared to 8.15% at the end of 2020. That is the only industry group to have seen short interest drop by a full percentage point or more. The industry group to have experienced the next largest decline was Transportation with aggregate short interest falling from 5.08% to 4.13%. Conversely, there are two industries, Banks and Materials, that have higher short interest as a percent of float than they did at the end of 2020.

I am trying to find those stocks now.," I have been playing stocks with a strategy of attempting to pick the next big thing, like the next google or amazon before it gets popular.  I realize this is high risk so I limit what I 'gamble' but i have been having pretty good success.

I started doing this in late 2018 with $30k and it is now worth $267k. What I think will be big are the following markets:

Space: TSLA. SPCE, AJRD

Renewable energy and Batteries: SEDG, ENPH, TSLA, BEP

Self Drive cars: TSLA, APTV

Genetic medicine: EDIT, CRSP, SRNE

NOBODY wants to work in an office again: CRWD, AMZN, WMT

Those are my current focus areas. Those are the primary stocks I have been buying in those areas to get my gains over the past few years.

I've gotten pretty lucky the past few months and made some YUGE gains on lucky guesses. I would like to rotate about 25% of my portfolio away from the lofty evaluation stocks and I just can't seem to find any good ones right now. I'm heavily invested in stuff like TSLA, NVDA, FANGM, GM, NIO, BLNK.

What is a normal market like? I have no experience investing in periods like 2001-2007, 2010-2019, 1982-1990, 1991-1998, so what is it like? Do P/E ratios actually matter?

2021-02-06 16:45:10,r/stocks,"Biggest U.S. Pension Bought More NIO and Activision Stock, and 2 Retailers","America’s largest public pension by assets under management recently made major changes to its investment portfolio.

The California Public Employees Retirement System bought more NIO ￼ (ticker: NIO) and Activision ￼ Blizzard (ATVI) shares, and raised its investments in retailers Walmart ￼ (WMT) and Target ￼ (TGT) in the fourth quarter. Calpers, as the pension fund is known, disclosed the trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Calpers, which has total assets of $445.6 billion, declined to comment on the stock trades.

The pension bought 284,842 more American depositary receipts of the Chinese electric-vehicle maker, ending 2020 with 2.6 million ADRs. Calpers had been buying up NIO in the third quarter, as well.

NIO ADRs rocketed more than 12 times in value last year, and so far in 2021 through Friday’s close, they were up 16.3%. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 index, a broad measure of the market, rose 16.3% in 2020, and has gained 3.5% so far this year.

NIO’s deliveries were strong in January, a bullish sign for investors, who seem to have an insatiable appetite for EV stocks. Nonetheless, NIO moved in January to raise capital through bonds.

Calpers bought 1.8 million Activision shares in the fourth quarter, lifting its investment to 6.2 million shares of the videogame maker.

Activision stock surged 56.3% in 2020 as the homebound stepped up their indoor gaming. So far this year, shares have gained 9.4%.

Earnings last week topped expectations, sending Activision stock zooming. Activision said in December that its latest version of World of Warcraft is the fastest-selling PC game of all time. That announcement was on the heels of another upbeat assessment of the sales of another game.

Walmart stock surged 21.3% in 2020, but so far this year it is nearly flat with a gain of 0.1%.

At least one analyst thinks Walmart stock is due for another double-digit rise in 2021. The retail giant is continuing a digital push, even as its e-commerce chief retired at the end of January.

Calpers bought 824,835 more Walmart shares in the fourth quarter, raising its holdings to 7.3 million shares.

The pension bought 436,897 additional Target shares to raise its investment to 1.9 million shares.

Target stock outdid Walmart’s in 2020, soaring 37.7%, and it has gained 7.0% so far this year.

Target stock slipped in January after investors were disappointed that holiday sales weren’t stronger. The shares still have fans on Wall Street A Barron’s stock pick in the late summer, Target did quite well through the end of 2020.

2021-01-30 04:34:36,r/stocks,"What to make of the week &amp; 3 buying opportunities NOT named GME, AMC and BB","A volatile end to the week, with the DOW falling below 30000, and the markets selling off.  There are a few headlines to consider... some say it was hedgefunds selling to cover their losses, others say it was the J&amp;J trials posting results that fell below expectations, and others say we are at the beginning of a complete crash (maybe a correction, but a complete crash is unlikely).  Ultimately, for the investor sell-offs can be healthy and can present buying opportunities.  Full disclosure, I haven't bought a single share of GME, AMC, BB, or NOK.  I have my eyes set on other buying opportunities--opportunities that I think will continue to pay off in the long run.  These are stocks where I slightly increased my positions in today and will continue to consider buying next week depending on how the markets play out.  **Even when you see a buying opportunity, you don't all-in on one given day.  You don't know what the next day/week/month will look like.**

&amp;#x200B;

1. **WMT:**  WMT has had a \~7% dip since hitting 150.  WMT has plans to really ramp up its presence in the advertising industry, which, in my opinion, has a lot of potential.  WMT has 250M customers on a weekly basis, globally.  They are planning to release their consumer data to companies, which would be an incredible source of information for those in the ad industry. To compare, Amazon tallied about 26M transactions per week which is about 182 M per week.  WMT has made it clear that it wants to increase its revenue from ads 10+ times within the next 5 years.
2. **Apple:** INCREDIBLE earnings beat.  Can't emphasize that enough.  There is so much already publicized about Apple's amazing quarter.  Yet, the price has fallen \~8%.  It's likely that Apple has more room to grow as Apple has announced that they'd be producing their own chips.  Consumers who are looking for a computer upgrade, are likely to hold until Apple's newest technology comes out.  Tim Cook is always looking to push Apple's presence and innovation.  I'm looking to increase my position in Apple.
3. **Visa:**  Another great earnings beat followed by a sell-off.  I'm looking at this as a great buying opportunity.  This is more of a macro trend play.  Visa did well given its boost in consumers shopping online.  I can only see a company like Visa doing better as cities begin to open up once the pandemic begins to clear.  There's a pent up demand to travel, to be out, to buy into experiences that we haven't been able to do for almost a year now.  Visa's fintech plays may not have worked out, but Visa is here to stay.

Honorable mentions for a diversified portfolio: FB, SBUX/MCD, BAC/JPM, DIS (when it hit close to 160).

**MY FAVORITE: CANF,CNCE, EYE, NGD, SSRM, WMT**



$AEYE - Descending Triangle which isn't great, but a possible breakout. Really great area of reward, just bouncing off the 50EMA line as well. Indicators also look good.

[https://tos.mx/AZ1eyVs](https://tos.mx/AZ1eyVs)

&amp;#x200B;

$ATNX - Great area of value, just needs to break the 50EMA line. Good value, just not much more going for it. Indicators look good though, just needs to show some green.

[https://tos.mx/iJ8r5xk](https://tos.mx/iJ8r5xk)

&amp;#x200B;

$CANF - Fantastic channel, higher lows, and great potential. Love that it is at support as well. Indicators are all fair, but I love the price action.

[https://tos.mx/rVTjlkr](https://tos.mx/rVTjlkr)

&amp;#x200B;

$CNCE - Massive selloff, right into support. Do I think it is too good to be true, kind of. But it showed life before close here. Indicators look fantastic as well.

[https://tos.mx/eoT2TXL](https://tos.mx/eoT2TXL)

&amp;#x200B;

$EYE - Absolute unit of a channel up. Also at support, it is super beautiful right here. Hovers above the 200EMA which it is known to do. Beautiful indicators as well.

[https://tos.mx/FRbYRZ4](https://tos.mx/FRbYRZ4)

&amp;#x200B;

$FLXN - Great channel up from here, I want to see a breakout. 200EMA bounce play right here as well. Could drop a tad more. Indicators are fair right now.

[https://tos.mx/haiO1G0](https://tos.mx/haiO1G0)

&amp;#x200B;

$KO - Massive sell off, right into support and trend support. Looking for a great long term hold. Everything is oversold obviously and has room to run up easily.

[https://tos.mx/Ct2tgQ7](https://tos.mx/Ct2tgQ7)

&amp;#x200B;

$NGD - Great channel here. Such a nice support area and often breaks 200EMA to come right back. I love this channel. Indicators look great, could reverse very close.

[https://tos.mx/sgLU6Na](https://tos.mx/sgLU6Na)

&amp;#x200B;

$SSRM - Obvious channel down, but we right at the bottom of it though. Holding support, and I love this channel overall. Indicators all oversold, and looking to reverse soon.

[https://tos.mx/2c8Ctvv](https://tos.mx/2c8Ctvv)

&amp;#x200B;

$WMT - Beautiful channel up here. Right where we want it to be, and sharing support as well. All indicators look to be ready to reverse. I think this is a low risk medium reward.

2021-01-17 14:13:12,r/stocks,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How is ""Hype"" calculated?**

Well, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

What every line means. I also use RSI, Stoch, Vortex Indicator, 10-50-200EMA Lines. I also trade off of the 180D/4H Chart

&amp;#x200B;

$ENBL: Possible triangle, but certainly a value here. Support, 200EMA, trendline, awesome. RSI and Stoch just curled and Vortex says fair price.

&amp;#x200B;

$ETON: Ascending Triangle and channel play here, right above the POC. RSI is fair, but Stoch is low and so is Vortex which is good. Riding 200EMA lines as well!

&amp;#x200B;

$EYE: Support, channel support, 50EMA all lined up? Gorgeous; and showing Stoch Divergence. RSI fair and Vortex is a fair price too. Great setup.

&amp;#x200B;

$FITB: Great channel up. This is a great value for this type of play. Perfect 50EMA bounce as well. Vortex low and Stoch low with a divergence, love it!

&amp;#x200B;

$KPTI: What a beautiful channel. Showed life todat after I called it yesterday. RSI oversold, Vortex super low, and Stoch just curled, beautiful.

&amp;#x200B;

$RF: Channel up again, beautiful rise up with the 50EMA bounce. Indicators are fair at best, so this isn't AS strong as others, but a great deal.

&amp;#x200B;

$ROK: Triangle play, Stoch is oversold, and Vortex is consolidating. Has big move written all over it.

&amp;#x200B;

$SPLK: Fantastic deal right here. 50EMA and support play. RSI fair, Stoch and Vortex very low, which means we should see a reversal very soon.

&amp;#x200B;

$SPT: Called before, calling again. Right above the 200EMA where it reverses at - with all indicators super low? Looooove it.

&amp;#x200B;

$UMH: Channel up and forming a new one, so we want to get in now. RSI, Stoch and Vortex low which is great. IF it shows life tomorrow, go long for sure.

&amp;#x200B;

$VERI: 50EMA, ascending triangle, and support area -- great play. Stoch is oversold, other 2 are fair value.

&amp;#x200B;

$WMT: Beautiful channel up. If it dies more here, then wait till about $141. But Indicators say it will be reversing soon, but a great channel.",12,5,No_Seesaw1134,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/knfd7d/my_watchlist_for_12312020/,knfd7d

2020-12-20 19:34:25,r/stocks,My Watchlist For 12/21/2020," I use RSI, Stochastic, MACD, Volume Profile, and 10-50-200EMA Lines.

&amp;#x200B;

**$ADC**: Beautiful channel. It is a possible triangle as well. This is a very strong support area, if it does die, just buy in at trendline or next support for more profit. RSI and Stochastic oversold.

**$AMH**: Literal textbook ascending triangle. This is the same set up as $SMAR, $FEYE, and other major winners we have had. Great value, 200EMA support, Stochastic oversold with divergence? Love this play so much.

**$AMRX**: We literally just made 20% off of this. It has historically had pullbacks on big moves up, and this is that I think. It is also right above BOTH the 50 and 200EMA at a support? So much convergence here. Stochastic oversold.

**$AOS**: What a great channel up, and at a strong support area as well! It technically has room to drop back to the 200EMA, but it has strength to keep running here.

**$ATO**: Long term triangle, which is great. Support area is very strong here as well. Consistence higher lows so it can't get much lower here hopefully. Also sowing Stochastic oversold divergence.

**$AUPH**: What a value here, how much lower can it get here?! Of course it CAN go lower, but then we just cut and buy in next support. Stoch, RSI over sold which is also great.

**$CNCE**: This channel was broken and now it is retesting it, so that is our play here. May possibly drop to the 50EMA which is also an easy play for us. Stoch shows volume is coming.

**$CRK**: Same play as $AUPH basically.

**$JILL**: Just made 18% off of it and now we trying it again. Channel gives us great results, and it is technically an ascending triangle here too. I think this has massive potential.

**$PCH**: Same play as $CNCE

**$TEVA**: Great ascending triangle that is now at a support which I love. 200EMA is also right here which is fantastic. RSI and Stochastic oversold, so I think it is really gearing up to push up farther.

**$TGT**: This one is not ready yet, let it drop a little more to the 200EMA / golden channel then go long; but I do not want you to miss this one.

**$TXN**: This bounces off the 50EMA line like clockwork, if it DOES break, you just buy at the 200EMA. Could not be any easier, the gold lines are just good indications for where they stay near.

**$UNVR**: Ascending triangle here, but it does have a history of failing and not breaking out. But when it does, it is going to go crazy. Also riding the 50EMA.

**$WMT**: Needs to hold the 200EMA here. If it does not, buy in at the bottom gold line. Stochastic and RSI say it does have more room to drop too. But it keeps going up, so even if you mess up your entry, you'll eventually be green.",37,7,No_Seesaw1134,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kgzdgb/my_watchlist_for_12212020/,kgzdgb

Wanted to invest 10k into the following stocks: WMT, AAPL, and TD (Toronto-Dominion Bank).

I plan on being a long-term holder, and not looking to get ""rich quick"".

Does anyone have any comments about the three companies I want to pursue?

The reason I chose these three companies was because I see them all increasing in the upcoming months/years and wanted to get in them while I can.

2020-12-08 01:45:07,r/stocks,Walmart &amp; Tesla Speculation (using Parking lots),"Walmart probably has the best real estate in US (+some in other countries). It's parking lots are not that utilized. Recently, they tinkered with playing movies during WMT downtimes to boost sales.
With the advent of EV companies, huge real estate is needed for Charging &amp; Battery Swap stations. Gas stations are I'll equipped for this job as not many have sufficient parking space. Enter Walmart! EV companies, they get scalability without much capital investment &amp; Walmart gets commission+sales
(Same case can be made for Costco, Kohls etc.)

2020-11-17 22:43:05,r/stocks,"Amazon jumps into the pharmacy business with online prescription fulfillment, free delivery for Prime members","* **Amazon is making its biggest move yet into the pharmacy space.**
* **Amazon Pharmacy is designed to make it easy and convenient to order prescription medicines online.**
* **There’s also a savings program and free two-day shipping for Prime Members.**

[Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AMZN) is entering the pharmacy business with a new offering called Amazon Pharmacy, allowing customers in the United States to order prescription medications for home delivery, including free delivery for Amazon Prime members.

Amazon has been quietly building out its pharmacy offering for several years [after ramping](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/16/amazon-selling-drugs-pharamaceuticals.html) up internal discussions in 2017 and [acquiring PillPack](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/10/why-amazon-bought-pillpack-for-753-million-and-what-happens-next.html) in 2018. The pharmacy space is notoriously complex and competitive in the U.S., and Amazon Pharmacy is built in part on PillPack’s infrastructure, including its pharmacy software, fulfillment centers and relationships with health plans.

Amazon Pharmacy, announced Tuesday, is the company’s biggest push yet into $300 billion market, and threatens the dominance of traditional pharmacies like [CVS](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=CVS) and [Walgreens](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WBA), as well as other large retailers that offer pharmacy services, including [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WMT).

Pharmacy stocks [tumbled](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/walgreens-drops-11percent-to-lead-drug-store-stocks-lower-after-amazon-launches-pharmacy-business.html) following the launch of Amazon Pharmacy. [CVS](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=CVS) shares fell 7.5% in morning trading Tuesday. [Walgreens Boots Alliance](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WBA) dropped more than 8%. Shares of [Rite Aid](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=RAD) slid more than 16%. [GoodRx](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GDRX), which helps consumers find discounts on prescription drugs, [fell](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/shares-of-goodrx-plunge-after-amazon-announces-push-into-pharmacy.html) more than 18%. Amazon shares jumped more than 1%.

For Amazon, the announcement is well timed. Americans are increasingly relying on getting their medicines via mail to avoid possible exposure to the coronavirus. That shift could be permanent, as more people than ever before are learning about new ways of receiving medication.

“We wanted to make it easy for people to get their medication, understand the cost and get it delivered to the home,” said TJ Parker, Amazon’s vice president of pharmacy, who previously co-founded PillPack. “The hard work is to make it easy ... there were a number of complications behind the scenes.”

“We think this new benefit will add tremendous value to our members,” added Jamil Ghani, vice president of Amazon Prime. “It’s relevant as folks try to do more from the comfort and safety of their homes.”

## How it works

Customers over the age of 18 will have access to the pharmacy service this week in 45 states, not including Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana and Minnesota. Amazon expects to serve those states over time.

Amazon Pharmacy will accept most forms of insurance, but could offer savings for people without insurance as well. Customers can also use flexible spending accounts or health savings accounts to buy prescriptions on the service.

Before customers order medication for the first time, the site might ask them questions such as whether they’re pregnant, their date of birth and their gender as it was assigned at birth. That information is required by law to provide pharmacy care, and it helps pharmacists to do things like confirm prescriptions.

Doctors can send prescriptions directly to Amazon Pharmacy, or patients can request a transfer from an existing retailer, like CVS or Walgreens. Amazon says it has tools to verify that a physician legitimately ordered each prescription, and to tamp down on potential fraud.

Amazon Prime customers get free two-day delivery, although shipping might take up to five days the first time a customer orders, as it takes time to transfer a medication. Customers who don’t have Prime can get free delivery within five days, or they can pay $5.99 to upgrade to two-day delivery.

The medicines on offer include a mix of generic and brand-name drugs. Customers can get access to birth control, as well as commonly prescribed drugs like insulin, triamcinolone steroid creams, metformin for controlling blood sugar and sumatriptan for migraines.

Amazon will not deliver Schedule II controlled medications, including most opioids, and it won’t be replacing the Health &amp; Personal Care store by offering vitamins and supplements.

Customers who have questions about their medications can reach a pharmacist or pharmacy technician at any time through online self-service or phone. Amazon will also screen for potentially problematic drug interactions for customers who are taking multiple medications at once.

Amazon’s Parker said that the storage and collection of customer health information is in compliance with federal HIPAA rules, and the company won’t share pharmacy data with advertisers or marketers without permission.

Amazon has leveraged its rich troves of customer data to build advertising into a key pillar of its overall business, and shows customers personalized ads and offers discounts based on what they have bought in the past. But consumers are likely to have a different set of expectations when they’re placing a prescription order versus browsing for a new pair of pants.

“The information and experience you have inside the pharmacy is separate and distinct from the experience that you have on Amazon.com,” Parker said.

PillPack will continue to serve customers even after Amazon Pharmacy launches. That’s because PillPack is designed for a different use-case: It delivers medicines on a 30-day schedule to a population of patients that tend to be sicker and older than average, and often require multiple prescriptions.

## For Prime users: A prescription savings benefit

Amazon Prime members have access to an additional pharmacy perk called the “prescription savings benefit,” which offers a discount of up to 80% on generic medications and up to 40% on brand-name prescriptions.

Amazon negotiated those discounts through a relationship with the Inside Rx savings program, which is part of Evernorth, a company that grew out of a merger between Express Scripts and insurance giant [Cigna](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=CI) in 2018. Insurers use pharmacy benefits managers like Evernorth to negotiate drug rebates from drug manufacturers in exchange for better coverage.

Even for people who have health coverage, the Prime price might still end up being more affordable than the copay -- Amazon’s Parker said it happens “more frequently than people think” (although it won’t count toward a deductible).

Prime customers can also get a prescription savings benefit card to use at up to 50,000 pharmacies, including CVS, Walmart, Rite Aid and Walgreens. This might be preferable for customers who have an urgent need for medication and can’t wait two days for delivery.

Amazon’s Parker said the company does not currently have any brick-and-mortar pharmacies, and declined to speculate on its plans. But in future, the company could add pharmacies to Whole Foods and its chain of Amazon Fresh stores.

2020-11-16 02:30:53,r/stocks,"Walmart to sell Japanese supermarket Seiyu to KKR, Rakuten","(Reuters) - U.S retailer Walmart Inc (WMT.N) sold most of its stake in Japan's Seiyu to investment firm KKR (KKR.N) and e-commerce company Rakuten (4755.T) in a deal valuing the supermarket chain at 172.5 billion yen ($1.65 billion), the companies said.

Walmart first entered the Japanese market in 2002 by buying a 6% stake in Seiyu, and gradually built up its stake before a full takeover in 2008.

But the company, like other foreign entrants lured by the high spending power of Japanese consumers but frustrated by cut-price competition, has struggled to make money in Japan.

KKR will buy 65% of Seiyu and Rakuten will acquire a 20% stake while Walmart will retain 15%, the companies said in a joint statement.

Japanese media reported two years ago that Walmart was seeking a buyer for Seiyu, and a sale could amount to around 300 billion to 500 billion yen.

Sources said at the time that it failed to find a buyer. Walmart said last year, amid speculation it was seeking to exit Japan, that it aimed to list Seiyu but retain a majority stake in the business.

# **Tug of war between value and growth stocks may drive the market again in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/13/tug-of-war-between-value-and-growth-stocks-may-drive-the-market-again-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; The stock market is caught between the rapidly spreading virus and the promise of a vaccine.
*****
&gt; That is likely to drive trading in the week ahead, as it did in the past week. Investors have been weighing cyclical plays that will do better when the economy reopens fully, against the big tech and growth names that weathered the virus shutdowns in the spring and benefit from the stay-at-home trend.
*****
&gt; In the past week, that trade resulted in a mixed performance with the Dow up 4% but the Nasdaq down about 0.5%, as investors sold off technology and communications services stocks. The S&amp;P 500 finished up 2.2% at a record close of 3,585, its first since Sept. 2. The renewed spread of the virus by mid-week had tamped down the exuberance over news from Pfizer Monday that its vaccine has proven highly effective and could be broadly distributed next year.
*****
&gt; The election is still uncertain though the market has responded well to the idea that a Democratic president and a mixed Congress will likely result in gridlock. President Donald Trump refuses to concede while his campaign challenges election results. Former Vice President Joe Biden was declared the presumptive president-elect last Saturday and has been moving to organize a cabinet.

&gt; # Next hurdle for market
&gt; “We largely put the election in the rear view mirror. The next hurdle for this market to contend with will be the path of the virus, and that will be the chief focus. It means a less strident rotation,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “Growth has actually outperformed value for the last 17 years. That’s a lot of inertia to break...If this is a pivot point, it’s a long-term pivot point.”
*****
&gt; The surging virus is raising renewed concerns about the economy as some cities are likely to put new limits on activities to slow the spread. In the U.S. there were a record 153,400 new cases Thursday.
*****
&gt; Besides the virus headlines, investors will be watching economic data, particularly retail sales Tuesday and existing home sales Thursday. There are a flurry of Fed speakers, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida Monday.
*****
&gt; Retailers report earnings in the week ahead with reports from Walmart and Home Depot Tuesday and Target Wednesday. NVIDIA also reports on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; The Pfizer news and the election outcome combined to unleash a new wave of bullishness early in the past week. Goldman Sachs, for instance, put a target of 4,200 on the S&amp;P 500 for 2021, and JPMorgan said the benchmark could rise to as high as 4,500 next year.
*****
&gt; # Value vs growth
&gt; Hogan said the value play trend had actually been underway before the Pfizer news and is what helped take the Russell 2000 to close at a new high for the first time Friday since August, 2018.
*****
&gt; Small caps in the Russell 2000 have been outperforming for the past three months. Since Oct. 1, the Russell is up 15.5%, compared to just under 6.6% gain for the S&amp;P 500. In the past week, the Russell was the best performer, up 6% for the week on Friday, compared to the 2.2% gain in the S&amp;P 500.
*****
&gt; In the past week, energy stocks surged 16.5%,and airlines were up 10.5%, The S&amp;P financial sector was up 8.2%, with commercial banks gaining 11.2%. At the same time, information technology declined 0.4% and consumer discretionary stocks were down 1.1%. Communications services was among the weak performers, up just 0.8%
*****
&gt; “I think it’s just a constant tug of war...based on what we see with the virus headlines and such. I think that’s driving a lot,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group. “When you get the bad headlines, you start seeing the growth stocks do well. When you get the good headlines, you start seeing the value stocks doing better.”
*****
&gt; Hickey expects to continue seeing vaccine developments from other manufacturers. “Some of these high-flying Covid stocks are going to get hit as the headlines get better. We’ve been rotating out of the large cap tech stocks, but we don’t think they’re necessarily going to go down, so to speak,” he said. “We just think there’s better opportunity in some of the more cyclical parts of the market. It’s more a function of underperformance than decline.”

&gt; # A Very Good Ten

&gt; With nearly ten trading days under its belt for November, the S&amp;P 500 is putting together quite a month. Through early morning Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was up just over 9% which ranks as the best first ten trading days for a month since January 1987. In the entire history of the S&amp;P, there have only been 17 other months where the S&amp;P 500 was up over 9% in the first ten trading days of the month, and in the post-WWII period, there have only been five.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111320-First-Ten-Days-Copy.png))**

&gt; So, when a month starts off strong, does it usually finish that way? Or is there some sort of reversion to the mean? Unfortunately, prior experience isn't particularly consistent in one direction of the other. The table below shows each month since 1928 where the S&amp;P 500 was up at least 7.5% in the first ten trading days of a month. Overall, the S&amp;P 500's average rest of month performance has been a gain of 0.96%. That sounds good, but on a median basis, the rest of the month typically sees a decline of 0.2% with positive returns less than half of the time.

&gt; In looking at the chart above and the table below, you'll notice that most of the strong starts for the S&amp;P came during the Depression in the pre-WWII period. In 1932 and 1933, for example, there were five occurrences each year! Looking at the post-WWII period where the frequency of occurrences wasn't nearly as common, strong starts to a month typically saw a more positive but still not a very consistent trend. In the ten prior months since the end of WWII, the S&amp;P 500's average rest of month performance was a gain of 1.27% (median: 1.69%) with gains 60% of the time.

&gt; # November Expiration Week: S&amp;P 500 &amp; DJIA Stronger

&gt; DJIA has been up 11 of the last 16 years on Monday of expiration week and Friday is up 14 of the last 18 years with an average gain of 0.56%. By the way, it is not a mistake that November Op-Ex day has the same point change and percent change in 2014 and 2015. It was triple checked and its correct. If you go out 2 more decimal places in the percentage calculation, it’s different.

&gt; S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have not been as bullish as DJIA around or on November option expiration. S&amp;P 500 has advanced only 17 times during options expiration week while NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have climbed only 16 and 14 times respectively over the past 26 years. All four indices have posted average losses on Monday and aside from DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have been essentially mixed on options expiration day. Friday’s solid average gains across the board are largely due to a sizable gain in 2008. Any weakness next week could be a good entry point for new longs ahead of the historically bullish Thanksgiving holiday.

&gt; # Week before Thanksgiving DJIA Up 19 of 27, But…

&gt; DJIA has a solid track record over the last 27 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.46%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks are not as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 17 years with a median gain of 0.10%.

&gt; S&amp;P is up 16 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.35% and down 9 of the last 17, –0.13% median loss. NASDAQ is up 15 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.33% and down 9 of the last 17, –0.004% median loss. Russell 200 is up 14 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.36% and down 10 of the last 17, –0.27% median loss.

&gt; This sets up well for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.

&gt; # New High in New 52 Week Highs

&gt; As equities and other risk assets surge, a massive number of S&amp;P 500 stocks are hitting new 52 week highs today. As shown in the chart below, as of midday 27.92% of S&amp;P 500 stocks have reached new 52 week highs today and just one stock, Biogen (BIIB), is reaching a new 52 week low. The net reading of 27.72% is the highest reading for net new highs since January of 2018. Prior to that, you would need to go all the way back to May 22nd of 2013 to find the last time there was such a high reading.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Net-New-Highs-2.png))**

&gt; Looking at the best-performing stocks in the index today, the list is mostly comprised of the stocks that have been extremely beaten down in the COVID economy like energy, travel, and retail/retail real estate names. Despite this, some still find themselves as some of those furthest below their 52-week highs. Take for example Carnival Cruiselines (CCL). The stock is seeing a phenomenal 35% gain just in today's session, but even at today's highs it was still well over 60% below its high for the year. It is a similar story for CCL's peer, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) which is up 27.78% but was 61.4% from its highs at its best price today. On the other hand, there are 28 stocks that have come within 1% of their 52-week highs at their high prices today. Another 80 stocks have come within 5% of their 52-week highs at their intraday highs today.

&gt; # Big Milestone For Small Stocks

&gt; No US equity index has reacted more strongly since Election Day than the Russell 2000 small-cap index. As shown in the chart below, the index finally broke out above its highs from earlier in the year following Monday's positive vaccine news. After that move on Monday, the Russell 2000 was up over 10% in just the last six trading days.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/1110-RTY.png))**

&gt; In just about any other year besides 2020, a 10%+ move in the Russell 2000 would be an extraordinary move, but this year the most recent move is actually the sixth one of at least that much. In fact, coming out of the March lows, the Russell saw three six-day moves of 19.1%, 16.3%, and 14.8%, respectively. The frequency with which we've seen these 10%+ moves in the Russell 2000 over a six-day period has been unlike any other year in the Russell's history. Behind 2020, the year with the next highest total of 10%+ moves was 2011 (4) and then 2008 (3), and the most there has been in any twelve-month rolling basis is five spanning late 2008 through the first half of 2009.

&gt; # 3 Election Charts That Caught Our Attention

&gt; Stocks just had their best week since April, with the S&amp;P 500 Index incredibly a chip shot away from new all-time highs. Joe Biden will be the next President of the United States, but markets are confident Republicans will maintain the Senate, and this means gridlock in Washington. Remember, gridlock is good, as it pulls policy towards compromise and avoids extremes. Also, any legislative changes to taxes, regulation, and capital gains will have meaningful input from both parties.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, a split Congress tends to mean stronger stock returns, almost ignoring whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House. The most likely outcome from the election at this point is a Democratic president with a divided Congress—a scenario that historically has produced solid S&amp;P 500 returns of 15.9% a year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Assuming President-elect Joe Biden takes over in January 2021, it is important to note that historically stocks haven’t done as well the first and second years of a new president compared with an incumbent winning. This makes sense though, as historically voters may have chosen new leadership in part because of economic weakness, and the uncertainty of a new president’s policies could also hold things back some. If things are good, the president tends to win reelection. Things turn around significantly by the third year in office, though, if there’s new leadership. Of course, it’s worth noting that the first year of a new president has seen the S&amp;P 500 higher recently, with stocks up nearly 20% the first year under President Donald Trump (2017) and 23% under President Barack Obama (2009).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-2-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Lastly, the strength from stocks around the election has been rather historic. “The S&amp;P 500 added 1% on four consecutive days, which hasn’t happened since late 1982,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Although there are only three other times this rare blast of strength happened since WWII, it is worth noting that strong returns going out a year took place after each instance.” The bottom line: Extreme buying pressure has a funny way of resolving higher, and we don’t anticipate this time being any different.

&gt; # 3 The Biggest Winners Are Still Big Losers

&gt; With household names like Carnival (CCL), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Simon Property (SPG), and Royal Caribbean (RCL) all up over 20% today, more than a few people out there are probably kicking themselves for not owning any of them. But before you start ripping your hair out, keep in mind that just about all of these stocks are down (and in a big way) on the year. Of the 33 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are up over 20% following today’s vaccine news, all but one of them are still down year to date. The only exception is Expedia (EXPE), which even after a 20%+ gain is still up just 18% on the year.

&gt; In terms of sector representation, Energy tops the list with more than a third of the names (12) on the list. Behind Energy, Real Estate (8), Consumer Discretionary (6), and Financials (6) are the only other sectors with multiple stocks listed.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Best-Stocks-1109.png))**

&gt; Just as the best-performing stocks are all still underperforming the S&amp;P 500 on a year to date basis, the biggest losers today are among the year’s biggest winners. There are 25 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that were down on the day as of the middle of the afternoon, but the only one that is down on the year is Biogen (BIIB), a stock whose decline has nothing to do with the vaccine news. Including BIIB, the 25 biggest losers are still up an average of 41% YTD (median: 31%). Behind BIIB, the two worst-performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 today are Pool (POOL) and Etsy (ETSY). Both stocks are down over 10% on the day, but for the year are still holding onto gains of 56.4% and 190.5%, respectively.

&gt; # Policy Uncertainty Spiked Into the Election

&gt; For the month of October, the NFIB's reading on small business sentiment was unchanged at the headline levels but many of the sub-indices broadly pointed to further improvements in business conditions. That is not to say small businesses do not have their share of concerns. As shown in the chart below, the NFIB's index on Economic Policy Uncertainty rose another 4 points in October to 98 which is the second-highest reading on record behind November of 2016; around the time of the last presidential election.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111020-NFIB-Uncert2.png))**

&gt; The election played a role in the uncertainty as 31% of small businesses surveyed reported government-related concerns as their biggest problem in October (lower chart). That was up for the second month in a row and is around the high end of the past couple of year's range. Additionally, as discussed earlier, labor also dominates the minds of small businesses as small businesses report struggles in filling roles. 30% reported cost or quality of labor as the single most important problem (top chart). That is unchanged since August.

&gt; # Big Tech Fades and Small Caps Soar

&gt; Pfizer’s announcement that its vaccine for covid-19 appears to be 90% effective on Monday morning also gave new life to small-cap stocks, many of which have struggled throughout the pandemic. The announcement has also triggered an exodus from mega-cap tech stocks that had been the “go-to” positions throughout most of the pandemic.

&gt; The chart above is based upon a similar chart from page 112 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2020. It shows the typical one-year seasonal pattern of the ratio of the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000 from July through June (scale on right). Overlaid on top of this pattern is the performance of this ratio in 2020 so far through today’s close (left scale). When the ratio is declining, large-cap stocks are outperforming small cap stocks. When the ratio is climbing, small caps are outperforming. In a typical year, small-caps will lag until around late-September or early October and then take off right around mid-December.

&gt; Covid-19 related shutdowns and unemployment had kept small caps essentially sidelined this year. There were bouts of strength in late-July to mid-August and a brief surge in mid-September and again in early October. The recent surge higher could be an early start to the major move higher that typically begins around mid-December.

2020-10-19 22:08:18,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Mon, Oct 19, 2020. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 19, 2020**

Stocks fell after the sell-off accelerated in the last hour of the market, as market participants closely monitored development for a near-term stimulus package and rising coronavirus cases in Europe and the US. 

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 1.63% down. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished the day 1.49% down and the Dow Jones (DIA) ended the day 1.34% down. Stocks finished deep in the red after the last hour sell-off.

Over the weekend, there were several developments regarding a coronavirus-relief package. In comments to reporters in Nevada, Pres. Trump said “I want to do a bigger number than she wants \[Pelosi’s $2.2 trillion proposal\]. That doesn’t mean all Republicans agree with me, but I think they will in the end. If she would go along, I think they would too, on stimulus.” These comments imply that Pres. Trump is willing to propose a higher number than the $1.8 trillion the White House proposed recently. While Republicans have consistently balked at such a high price-tag, maybe Pres. Trump’s endorsement can help move the needle.

In response, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi set a Tuesday deadline for reaching an agreement with the Trump administration to pass stimulus before the November election. She and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, another key negotiator, reportedly continued to have discussions over the weekend and are scheduled to meet again today. Drew Hamill, Pelosi’s spokesperson said, “While there was some encouraging news on testing, there remains work to do to ensure there is a comprehensive testing plan that includes contact tracing and other measures to address the impact on the virus on different communities.”

According to data from John Hopkins, there were 57,000 and 48,000 new cases recorded on Saturday. While this is a marked improvement from 69,000 cases on Friday (the highest one day total since late-July) the numbers appear to be stagnating around the 50,000 new cases per day. The South and the Midwest have been the most hard-hit regions.

In Europe, there has been a surge in cases, with health and government officials warning of a second wave and imposing new restrictions throughout the continent. The Republic of Ireland will move into ""Level Five"" restrictions from midnight on Wednesday, the country's highest COVID alert level, for the next six weeks. Switzerland and Italy are imposing a nationwide mask mandate in all public spaces, even outdoors from Monday. In England a three-tier system remains in place, with varying restrictions imposed depending on whether an area is on ""medium,"" ""high"" or ""very high"" alert. London is an area of “high alert” meaning members of different households cannot meet in indoor spaces and restaurants, bars have a 10 p.m. curfew, and a ban on gatherings of more than six people. In France, nine cities, including Paris, have been placed under a 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew.

2020-10-19 18:18:55,r/stocks,Southwest or Delta long term?,"Hi! So my mom has been inspired by investing success over the last 3 months (I've earned 40% returns in 3 months, as compared to the market's 10% over the same period) and has asked me to invest her money for her IRA. I have most of the stocks figured out: AMZN, AAPL, FSLY, DOCU, PYPL, SQ, SE, WMT, NEE, FVRR, LULU, and NVDA. However, I wonder if I should include LUV and/or DAL in her portfolio. Also worth noting is that only half of her IRA money will be in stocks: the other half will be in ETFs.

My belief is that LUV is simply the better stock. They have a better balance sheet and equally importantly, they are a leisure-focused airline. A core assumption I'm using is that while leisure travel is a temporary loser of the COVID-19 pandemic, business travel, as much as I hate to say it, is a permanent loser of it. Yeah, it will still be around, but it will most likely be a permanently smaller part of the aviation industry going forward, and you can thank Zoom for that. There was a Motley Fool article written back in August about how Zoom is the biggest long-term threat to airlines, and I agree. However, I know that this is no guarantee. It's really a question of if the economic benefits of in-person meetings are greater than the travel expenses, and honestly, I have no way to know if that's true. I have a family friend who works at Goldman Sachs so next time I get to talk to him I'll ask him about this. Even if business travel does recover, though, it will be a far slower recovery than for leisure travel, so ultimately whether the first assumption is true or not, it can be confidently said that leisure travel will win out during these years of recovery and possibly beyond.

However, there is also a case to be made for DAL. The main lure I see for them is the general care toward their passengers that I have not seen from the other 2 major airlines, American and United. These things add up and I could see them luring some upper-middle-class leisure travelers who have money to invest in a higher quality flight but are concerned about the virus and disease in general. So even if Delta's business travelers don't return, they can still come back up because of those new, wealthier leisure travelers. These travelers are also likely to be some of the same workers that can do remote work a lot of the time, so they will have more time off to travel, which strengthens that case even more. If Delta can win some of that market, they could definitely do well in the future.

What do you guys think? Thank you in advance!

P.S: I hear that you guys are concerned that I'm investing my mother's money in the market. I completely understand this, and I am aware that. However, I'd like to be clear that she told me I can do this. I am also using Motley Fool to help guide me, so I am not on my own here. Also, for the question of this post, I basically told her that she can do what she wants in regards to that, but I could not justify either stock right now.

2020-10-13 04:02:18,r/stocks,"$ACI, an undervalued stock with upcoming ER and huge return potentials","Consider buying $ACI now while it's still trading below $15. Its earnings is scheduled on next Tuesday (10/20) and I think it will keep grinding up slowly till then. A massive earnings beat is expected, which might send it to $20+ like $BBBY earlier this month.

$ACI's forecasted 12 Month forward PEG Ratio is	 0.61. PEG ratio is a measure of correlation between the company's market value and its projected earnings growth. When the ratio is less than 1, it implies that the company is undervalued. Sitting at a current PEG ratio is around 0.40, $ACI is extremely undervalued to say the least. For example, $WMT has a PEG ratio of 4.75, $TGT has 3.13, $COST has 4.93, and $DG has 2.15 right now. 

$ACI IPO-ed in late June and till now has remained mostly unnoticed. This earnings, in my opinion, will be its beckoning call and I can see it hovering around $30 by the end of the year.

If you're into options: $ACI's November calls are really cheap right now. The 11/20 $17.5 calls are 20 cents, while the $20 calls are just 10 cents.",30,5,ashk20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ja4f3c/aci_an_undervalued_stock_with_upcoming_er_and/,ja4f3c

2020-10-02 22:17:28,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, Oct 2. What a crazy day!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 2, 2020**

Stocks opened deep in the red Friday but managed to recover some throughout the session. Pres. Trump’s announcement that he had tested positive for the coronavirus injected further uncertainty into an already volatile environment, concerned with the pandemic and the upcoming presidential election.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) underperformed heavily, finishing the day 2.81% down. The S&amp;P (SPY) finished the day 0.94% down, and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.5%

Last night, President Trump announced that he and the First lady tested positive for the coronavirus. This comes shortly after it was reported that Hope Hicks, senior counselor to Pres. Trump tested positive. Joe Biden announced that he was negative after spending time with Trump during the debate. Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com said, “Word that the president and first lady have tested positive for COVID-19 marks the addition of further uncertainty when it was already abundant, typically toxic for financial markets. We were already expecting that with the approach of Election Day. No doubt this may exacerbate that risk amid no shortage of other sources of uncertainty and volatility."" The White House has canceled all of Trump’s previously scheduled public events, which included a rally in Florida on Friday.

Yesterday night, House Democrats voted to advance their new $2.2 trillion stimulus package, although it is almost certainly going to be struck down in the Republican-controlled Senate, who are rumored to have a ceiling at $1-1.5 trillion.

Today, the Labor Department reported that 661,000 jobs were added in the month of September, far below Wall Street’s expectation, suggesting that the labor market recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is slowing amid fading government support, political uncertainty, and rising infections in the US and Europe. Economists surveyed by Refinitiv, a well-respected provider of global financial markets data, estimated that 850,000 jobs would be added. This is the last monthly job report before the November election. Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of Global Fixed Income, said “The economy is still recovering and still seeing month-to-month pockets of improvement, but clearly the rate of employment recovery will be uneven from here. The fact remains that there continues to be great uncertainty regarding the progression of the coronavirus pandemic and the timing of a return to economic normalcy, and nowhere is that more apparent than in the labor market.

**Highlights**

* NIO  despite delivering more vehicles than expected in the third quarter, because investors may have bought the rumor and sold the news. 
* Tesla (TSLA) said it sold 139,300 vehicles in the quarter ended  Sept. 30 , slightly ahead of the 137,000 estimate. The figure topped the previous high of 112,000 vehicles and 44% above last year..

2020-09-29 23:21:38,r/stocks,Walmart Triples Tesla Semi Order In Canada,"Walmart Canada has more than tripled its order for Tesla Semi trucks in a show of confidence for the all-electric heavy-duty vehicles and the ability of its maker to deliver them.   

The Canadian division of retailer **Walmart, Inc.** [WMT 0.08%](https://benzinga.com/stock/wmt#NYSE) said Tuesday it reserved 130 of the trucks. Once in service, Walmart will have one of the biggest electric truck fleets in Canada as part of a companywide goal to [achieve zero emissions by 2040](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/walmarts-goal-for-its-trucks-no-more-diesel-by-2040). 

""I'm excited to have my drivers drive this truck,"" Francis Lalonde, Walmart Canada's vice president for transportation, told FreightWaves.

Walmart Canada expects to get its Teslas in 2021. Lalonde wouldn't detail the delivery schedule, but said the company has full confidence in **Tesla Inc.** [TSLA 0.51%](https://benzinga.com/stock/tsla#NASDAQ) ability to deliver them.

""We trust our partner,"" he said.  

The Teslas will operate within Canada as part of Walmart's private fleet of around 300 trucks with about 500 drivers. Their 500-mile range provides a good fit for Canadian fleet operations, which have drivers return to their distribution centers each day.

Walmart Canada has looked at other zero-emissions vehicles, but the Tesla Semi has so far proven the best one for its fleet, Lalonde said. Beyond the range and ability to haul 80,000-pound loads, the Tesla safety features — including its collision-avoiding autopilot — were an important selling point. 

""I firmly believe these are the safest trucks out there,"" Lalonde said. 

## ‘We've done our homework' on Tesla, Walmart executive says

Walmart Canada plans to have 20% of its fleet converted to electric power by the end of 2022. It hopes to have the entire fleet running on an alternative power source by 2028.

It also has no qualms about being an early adopter of the Tesla Semi. The truck has been considerably hyped by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and [also delayed](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/musk-time-for-tesla-semi-to-get-on-the-road). 

""We've done our homework,"" Lalonde said.

Walmart Canada's bet on the Tesla Semi comes as part of the larger embrace of new technology in the supply chain. The company successfully deployed a [blockchain-based freight payment system with DLT Labs](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/how-walmart-solved-canada-carrier-payment-woes-with-blockchain).

""It's called innovation,"" Lalonde said. ""Is there there any risk in being one of the first ones? Yes. But we're proud to be innovators.""

2020-09-29 21:31:41,r/stocks,Beyond Meat Stock Is Surging on Expanded Walmart Deal,"Beyond Meat stock is jumping Tuesday after the company announced an expanded distribution agreement with Walmart. The retail giant is planning to take Beyond products into 2,400 stores, up from 800.

Beyond Meat stock (ticker: BYND) often reacts positively to news of expanded distribution, but shares are up 10.6% because Walmart (WMT) is special.

It's the largest grocer in the U.S. by sales, with a top line of more than $190 billion for its fiscal year ended January 2020. Kroger (KR), the runner up, generated sales of $122 billion in the fiscal year ended January 2020.

Walmart has about 4,800 stores in the U.S., giving Beyond Meat about 50% penetration.

""Walmart has been a terrific partner and we're excited to strengthen that partnership in depth and breadth as we look to offer more Beyond Meat products at more Walmart locations, furthering our commitment to increasing accessibility of plant-based meat,"" said Chuck Muth, Beyond Meat's chief growth officer, in the company's news release.

As of June 27, Beyond Meat products were available in about 112,000 retail and food service outlets in 85 countries world-wide, the company said. About a year ago the number was 53,000. The growth as been impressive.

Beyond Meat stock is up about 122% year to date, far better than comparable returns of the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Wall Street, however, has some concerns. About 20% of analysts covering the stock rate shares at Buy. And 35% rate shares at Sell. The average Buy-rating percentage for stocks in the Dow is about 58%. The average Sell-rating percentage is less than 10%. What's more, the average analyst price target is roughly $124, below the $167 level where Beyond shares are trading.

Valuation appears to be the biggest hurdle for traditional food analysts. The company is valued at roughly 12 times estimated 2021 sales. That's far higher than peers, but Beyond Meat is growing rapidly. Sales in 2021 are expected to surge about 55% from 2020.

The major averages are higher at midday, as the Nasdaq leads the way with a greater than 1% advance. While concern remains over the U.S. elections and disappointment that Washington has not delivered more stimulus, there may be potential for the stimulus talks to resume as reports indicate the Democrats are working on a new proposal.

**ECONOMIC EVENTS:** In the U.S., durable goods orders edged up 0.4% in August, which was less than expected.

Data from the [Johns Hopkins](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) Whiting School of Engineering shows there are now 32.3M confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, including nearly 7M in the U.S., and 984,278 deaths due to the disease, including about 203,000 in the U.S.

**TOP NEWS:** Shares of Costco (COST) are 2% lower near noon after the company reported quarterly results last night. Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman, who said the ""knock"" on the report was weaker flow-through than market expectation, thinks this should prove temporary and sees a rare ""buy the dip"" opportunity with the stock off its early September high, he told investors following the earnings report as he and several peers raised their price targets for the stock.   


In M&amp;A news, William Hill (WIMHY) noted press speculation regarding a possible offer for the company and confirmed that it has received separate cash proposals from Apollo Management (APO) and Caesars Entertainment (CZR). ""Following an initial written proposal from Apollo on August 27, William Hill received a further proposal from Apollo and proposals from Caesars,"" the company said. Discussions are ongoing and each of Apollo and Caesars are required, by not later than 5.00 p.m. London time on October 23, to either announce a firm intention to make an offer for William Hill or announce that they do not intend to make an offer, the company added.

In COVID-19 news, Novavax announced that it has initiated its first Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of NVX-CoV2373, Novavax' COVID-19 vaccine candidate. The trial is being conducted in the United Kingdom, or UK, in partnership with the UK Government's Vaccines Taskforce and is expected to enroll and immunize up to 10,000 individuals between 18-84 years of age, with and without relevant comorbidities, over the next four to six weeks. Meanwhile, European governments will pay claims over an agreed upon limit against AstraZeneca (AZN) over unexpected side-effects from its potential COVID-19 vaccine, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-eu-astrazeneca/exclusive-astrazeneca-gets-partial-immunity-in-low-cost-eu-vaccine-deal-idUSL5N2GK3NE), citing an EU official. These terms are different than the terms of the agreement with Sanofi (SNY) as AstraZeneca secured the European Union's backing in a confidential agreement which reflects the lower price requested by the drugmaker, the official noted.

The U.S. Commerce Department order banning Apple (AAPL) or Google's (GOOG) app stores from offering TikTok for new downloads is set to occur late Sunday. Oracle (ORCL) and Walmart (WMT) have agreed to take stakes in TikTok Global, a newly created U.S. company that will own most of the app's operations worldwide.
