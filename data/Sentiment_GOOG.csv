Now, when you look up trending political events, economic forecasts, or market outcomes, you’ll see live prediction data sourced from Polymarket’s markets, It’s a subtle but powerful step showing how traditional tech is merging with decentralized data layers.  
  
However, this push toward more open and direct data access feels similar to what’s happening in trading, where the friction is gradually disappearing, Paying trading fees, for instance, feels outdated when exchanges like Bitget already support zero fee trading, The old habit of paying for every click or trade feels like holding onto unnecessary constraints, much like relying on filtered information instead of raw, real time data.  
  
Google’s integration could mark the beginning of a broader shift, one where data transparency and user access take priority over gatekeeping.

2025-11-05 18:58:27,r/GOOG_Stock,Google: The Most Innovative Company That Keeps Failing Forward,"Say what you want about Google — no other company has dared to fail this boldly.
They don’t just copy trends; they invent them… sometimes 5–10 years too early.

From smart glasses to modular phones and social networks, Google’s graveyard of consumer innovation reads like a sci-fi museum of the future that never came.
But here’s the thing: the direction was always right.
The timing? Not so much.

⸻

The Big List — Google’s Most Ambitious Consumer Flops

🥽 Google Glass (2013–2015)
Augmented reality glasses years before Apple Vision Pro.
Failed due to privacy concerns, bad UX, and no clear use case — but the idea was prophetic.

📱 Project Ara (2013–2016)
Modular smartphone dream: swap your camera, battery, speaker.
Too complex, too expensive, and the market didn’t care enough.

🧭 Project Tango (2014–2017)
3D mapping and AR sensors in phones — basically LiDAR before Apple.
Died quietly, reborn as ARCore.

🕶️ Google Daydream VR (2016–2019)
Mobile VR before Meta made it mainstream.
Uncomfortable, low-quality, and lacked content.

🎥 Google Clips (2017–2019)
A tiny AI-powered camera that “decided” when to record.
Cute idea, but… too creepy for most people.

⸻

💬 The Social &amp; Software Graveyard

🌐 Google+ (2011–2019)
The would-be Facebook killer.
Solid tech, zero social energy, and privacy blunders.
Still, the “Circles” concept was genius — maybe ahead of its time.

💡 Google Wave (2009–2012)
Real-time collaboration before Notion or Slack existed.
Brilliant, confusing, unmarketable.

✉️ Inbox by Gmail (2014–2019)
AI-driven email before everyone cared about AI.
Killed because it was too good — Gmail absorbed it.

🎮 Google Stadia (2019–2023)
Cloud gaming done right — except for the content, pricing, and ecosystem.
Technically amazing, commercially doomed.

⸻

🛰️ And the Weird &amp; Wonderful
	•	Google Loon: Internet via stratospheric balloons. Died when Starlink took over.
	•	Nexus Q: A mysterious $299 media orb nobody understood.
	•	Google Fiber: Gigabit internet, but not scalable enough.
	•	Google Play Music / Allo / Duo: Victims of fragmentation and strategic confusion.

⸻

⚙️ Why Google Keeps “Failing Forward”
	1.	🚀 Too early to market — ideas before infrastructure.
	2.	🧩 Fragmented strategy — no unified ecosystem like Apple.
	3.	💡 “Launch &amp; Abandon” culture — great prototypes, no patience.
	4.	💰 Ad revenue safety net — no urgency to make hardware profitable.
	5.	🧠 Tech-first, human-second — brilliant engineers, weak storytelling.

⸻

🧭 The Irony

Every one of these “failures” laid groundwork for something that did succeed — just not at Google.
Apple Vision Pro owes something to Glass.
Slack and Notion owe something to Wave.
Meta’s AR/VR path follows Daydream and Tango.

⸻

🤔 So, Fellow Investors…

Maybe Google doesn’t fail — it just prototypes the future for everyone else.

&gt;The Monday debt takeout comes as Alphabet and other tech conglomerates have seen rising demand for their cloud and artificial intelligence services.
&gt;
&gt;Tech peer Oracle (ORCL.N) itself sought $18 billion in new debt in September, while Meta (META.O) raised $30 billion in bonds last month.

2025-11-03 01:49:01,r/stocks,AMD earnings risk and AI bubble,"Hello, ultimately it's unlikely that I make my decision based on reddit comments but I wanted to get my concerns out there in the ether because my head has become a hamster wheel with nobody to talk to to get an out. [I've made big gains this year, following big losses buying SMCI in 2024](https://imgur.com/a/sgTze17). I own 5 stocks but 46.33% is AMD and 41.58% is NVDA and AMD earnings are on Tuesday, I have limited time left to make changes. There's a lot of talk of AI bubble, but the hyperscalers announced yet another round of huge cap-ex increases for 2026. However, the concern seems valid as [seen in this interview](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-on-new-challeneges-in-ai-compute-is-not-the-bottleneck-but-is/articleshow/125033567.cms). 

Everyone knows there's a huge bottleneck when it comes to energy powering these data centers. If there's not enough power, then there's no point buying GPUs, especially since they quickly become outdated. However, this doesn't mean that GPU's are not needed, they would continue buying them if there was enough power. I thought about securing my gains and just transitioning to the energy sector, but those stocks seem 10x more overpriced than AMD and NVDA. How can you pick the winners that will execute correctly and compress their ratios? Simultaneously, no matter how overpriced people seem to think these stocks are, NVDA's PEG ratio is actually very reasonable. AMD is only 1/10th of the market cap of NVDA and the earnings could be a big disappointment or they could announce a huge increase in customers and sales for their new chips in 2026. 

Normally, I would be more cautious but I have made a life changing mistake in the past were I pretty much all-in'd NVDA stock in august 2022 (150k) after an announcement of china restrictions on chips as I was somewhat aware of the incoming AI tech after watching a documentary on google deepmind many years ago called ""alphago"". I sold my NVDA shares in january 2024, missing an over 10x gain on my investment if I just held because I was getting impatient after many months of the stock not moving anymore and a smaller investment I had in SMCI at the time (bought at 40$) went to 80$ in a very short time. Later on, I pretty much lost almost all of my gains from NVDA when SMCI had fraudulent earning reports. 

My expectation when buying AMD was that it would most likely reach a 800 billion to 1.2 trillion market cap in 1 to 3 years. I'm not sure if I would be making a huge mistake selling my AMD shares now where there could still be significant upside. As for NVDA, I was estimating a 6 trillion market cap before it went flat for a long time or corrected down significantly until power issues were solved. I still like AMD but it has run up so much, if they don't significantly increase guidance right away to justify these gains, a huge drop is likely to happen.

 I never liked buying indexes with stocks I don't know anything about, don't understand and don't care about. I'm thinking perhaps the best thing to do is sell all my NVDA and AMD shares completely before earnings and split it into TSM, MU, MRVL, VRT, GOOG as these stocks have lower PEG ratios",273,87,RainieY,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1omy2c3/amd_earnings_risk_and_ai_bubble/,1omy2c3

2025-10-29 18:14:34,r/stocks,Absolutely everything you need to know about MSFT earnings,"Okay, so it's finally time. With earning season ramping up, we have a bunch of techies going off today. MSFT, GOOG, and META are literally *all today*. So I wanted to put in my 2 cents for MSFT for those who are thinking of gambling.

Right now the consensus is

* Earnings per share: $3.67
* Revenue: $75.33 billion

Analysts are expecting Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes Azure and other cloud services, to pull in $12.8 billion for the quarter. [Cloud service revenue growth.](https://i.imgur.com/zwCFlce.png) The FactSet estimate for Azure’s year-on-year revenue growth is 38%. See, I think cloud stuff will continue to be the big driver of growth at Microsoft, as the business has proven to majorly benefit from [artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/) boom. Last quarter, Microsoft [disclosed](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/30/microsoft-msft-q4-earnings-report-2025.html) the scale of its Azure cloud infrastructure business in dollars for the first time. The company said revenue in fiscal 2025 from Azure and other cloud services jumped 34% from the prior year to more than $75 billion. Things were so good, it even reported a $368 billion backlog of business.

Microsoft is expected to report total revenue growth of 15% for the quarter from $65.6 billion a year ago.

During the call, I'll be paying close attention to Microsoft’s capital expenditures as the company races to build out the infrastructure necessary to support AI demand. They said July that it expected to spend $30 billion in capex and assets acquired through leases during the quarter, representing annual growth of more than 50%. CFO Amy Hood told investors at the time that capex will grow in fiscal 2026, but it will be a slowdown from 2025.

From my research, most analysts have a buy rating and expect Microsoft to offer healthy guidance, especially around Azure. They often mention Microsoft’s ongoing infrastructure projects and said that if the sites all get deployed, they could result in $30 billion to $40 billion in incremental annual revenue for the company.

As you guys already know, much of Microsoft’s AI momentum has been attributed to its tight relationship with OpenAI.

New terms in OpenAI deal = new opportunities

After some negotiation, [OpenAI announced](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/28/open-ai-for-profit-microsoft.html) that Microsoft updated its $13 billion partnership with them, essentially restructuring and formally outlined Microsoft’s stake in the company. Under the new structure, OpenAI’s nonprofit will hold a 26% stake in its for-profit arm, worth about $130 billion. Microsoft will hold a 27% stake worth about $135 billion, and current and former employees and investors will own the remaining 47%. They still retains its slice of OpenAI’s revenue in the agreement, which Bloomberg has [reported to be 20%](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/microsoft-to-get-27-of-openai-access-to-ai-models-until-2032), but that would end if they somehow achieve AGI (which an independent expert would confirm). And they still has IP rights for OpenAI’s models and products that will now extend to 2032, and access to research IP rights (how they build their models) until 2030, unless AGI is achieved. That allows it to continue to use the state-of-the-art AI in all of its existing products for the foreseeable future.

This is an insanely strong position in the AI industry, even if talk of an [AI bubble](https://sherwood.news/markets/everyone-is-admitting-the-ai-boom-might-be-a-bubble/) turns out to be true. Having the uncertainty of such an important deal resolved brings some clarity to the larger AI landscape and creates some new opportunities for Microsoft.

Microsoft is now free to pursue AGI on its own, or with partners. Up until now, Microsoft has mostly embraced OpenAI’s technology for use in its products (like [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/)), and doesn’t really have a large flagship AI model of its own yet (though it has built smaller, specialized models like [Phi](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/phi) and [MAI-1](https://microsoft.ai/news/two-new-in-house-models/)).

OpenAI is also agreeing to purchase $250 billion worth of Azure computing (yup, that again) as part of the reworked deal. But one thing could hurt Microsoft: it has given up its right of first refusal to be OpenAI’s main computing partner. That could mean losing a lot of business from the industry leader if OpenAI takes its compute to a competitor or uses its own [Stargate](https://sherwood.news/tech/rising-ambitions-and-skyrocketing-costs-heres-what-we-know-about-project/) data centers.

So what do we do for earnings? Microsoft stock has moved an average of nearly 6% following its four most recent earnings reports. In July, shares rose about 4% the day after [the company reported better-than-expected earnings](https://www.investopedia.com/microsoft-earnings-4q-fy2025-11782019) driven by cloud computing growth. Shares jumped more than 7% on [similarly strong results](https://www.investopedia.com/microsoft-earnings-q3-fy2025-11724456) in April. With analysts expecting Microsoft to report another quarter of strong revenue and earnings growth, so for the option traders here, I think we should get calls. We're basically all overwhelmingly bullish on Microsoft’s stock.

2025-10-29 17:59:13,r/GOOG_Stock,Exclusive new data shows Google is winning the AI search wars,"&gt;BrightEdge is a massive SEO firm that works with giant clients—including a majority of the Fortune 500—to rank their websites in search.
&gt;
&gt;That gives the company a unique perspective on what’s working in SEO at any given moment. And for most of this year, it saw Google floundering. 
&gt;
&gt;In data that BrightEdge shared with me in advance of publishing the new findings, Google had lost 1.5% of the search market share in 2025. That might not seem like much, but given that people perform around 5 trillion Google searches per year, a loss of 1.5% amounts to billions of queries.
&gt;
&gt;As of this month, though, BrightEdge told me that Google’s market share increased from 90.54% to 90.71%. I spoke with BrightEdge’s CEO, Jim Yu, to put that in perspective.
&gt;
&gt;Yu acknowledged that while an increase of 0.17% might seem small, given the scale involved, it’s actually a big deal.
&gt;
&gt;“We conservatively estimate each percent of search market share equates to between $1.5 billion and $2 billion” in ad revenue, Yu told me.

2025-10-27 19:18:34,r/stocks,Is Google quietly positioning itself to control future infrastructure? Energy + Payments + Big Data moves this week,"I’ve been tracking several recent headlines from Google (GOOG), and the timing feels more intentional than random. Within just a short period, Google has announced:

• Partnering with NextEra to build a nuclear-powered data center in the U.S.  
• Working with PayPal to launch a cloud-based agency payment solution for merchants  
• Upgrading its Bigtable storage layer to handle massive data growth more efficiently

Individually, none of these headlines are shocking.  
But when you look at them together, it seems like Google is building a **full-stack infrastructure strategy** for the future economy:

Energy → Dominance in compute power  
Nuclear-driven data centers reduce reliance on grids and regulatory bottlenecks.

Payments → The underlying rails of commerce  
Controlling payment flows reduces dependence on third-party fintech.

Data → The ultimate long-term moat  
Bigtable upgrades suggest they expect exponential data growth across AI, enterprise cloud, and real-time analytics.

Google is no longer just an advertising company.  
It feels like they’re positioning themselves to become the foundational layer of the entire digital economy.

2025-10-23 15:15:33,r/GOOG_Stock,Google: the most powerful tech organism on Earth - Inside the ultimate intelligence network built by humankind.,"If you had to define the concept of the universal tech company, Google (Alphabet) would be it.
Where most corporations dominate one or two verticals, Google executes at world-class level in more than ten — all connected through a single, evolving intelligence layer.
Let’s map the empire and see how this extraordinary technological diversity converges into a singular advantage 👇

⸻

🧠 I. The Core: Google as the world’s information infrastructure

Mission: “To organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.”
This is not marketing fluff — it’s the genetic code that binds every Google product together.

🔍 1. Google Search
	•	The world’s largest and most advanced AI system is, in fact, the search engine itself.
	•	With over 90% global market share and billions of queries per day, Search is Google’s perpetual data engine.
	•	It powers an enormous data feedback loop, feeding intelligence into Ads, YouTube, Gemini, Cloud AI, and every other product.

📍 2. Google Maps &amp; Earth
	•	Not just a map — it’s the digital twin of the planet.
	•	The foundation for autonomous mobility (Waymo), logistics, smart cities, and location-based advertising.
	•	Maps is one of the largest geospatial AI systems ever built, constantly learning from human movement and urban dynamics.

⸻

💰 II. The Money Engine: Ads &amp; YouTube

📢 3. Google Ads / AdSense
	•	Google didn’t just dominate online advertising — it invented the internet’s economic model.
	•	The synergy of Search, Maps, Gmail, Chrome, and Android forms a single, massive intent-detection network.
	•	The result: over $250 billion in annual ad revenue, arguably the most profitable machine in history.

🎥 4. YouTube
	•	The largest video platform on Earth — and the second biggest search engine.
	•	Through Premium, Music, Shorts, and Ads, YouTube has transcended traditional media.
	•	Its AI-driven recommendation system is the backbone of the modern attention economy.

⸻

☁️ III. The Next Goldmine: Google Cloud
	•	One of the fastest-growing cloud platforms — now fully profitable (as of 2024).
	•	Deep integration with AI and ML systems (Vertex AI, BigQuery, TPU).
	•	Serves as the enterprise backbone for the AI era — powering Gemini, Workspace, and Duet AI.
	•	It’s also the home of Google’s Quantum AI and TPU supercomputing infrastructure.

⸻

⚙️ IV. The Technological Engine Room

🤖 5. DeepMind
	•	The crown jewel of AI research (AlphaGo, AlphaFold, Gemini, SIMA).
	•	The neural cortex of Alphabet, setting the global agenda for artificial intelligence ethics and algorithms.
	•	DeepMind’s work directly feeds into every AI layer across the company.

🧮 6. Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)
	•	Google’s in-house silicon optimized for AI computation.
	•	A strategic counterweight to Nvidia’s GPU dominance.
	•	Every major AI workload inside Google runs on TPU — a massive scalability advantage.

⚛️ 7. Willow &amp; Quantum AI
	•	Willow is Google’s next-gen, energy-efficient chip designed for on-device AI acceleration.
	•	Quantum AI (Sycamore, Bristlecone) achieved quantum supremacy years ahead of rivals.
	•	These efforts converge toward a post-silicon computing paradigm, blending classical and quantum processing.

⸻

📱 V. The User Ecosystem

📲 8. Android &amp; Pixel
	•	Android: the world’s largest software platform (3+ billion active devices).
	•	Pixel: the AI-native device — where hardware and software truly fuse.
	•	Every Pixel acts as a showcase for Google’s most advanced on-device intelligence (Gemini, Lens, Assistant).

💬 9. Gmail, Translate, Chrome, Assistant
	•	Gmail: 1.8 billion users — the global backbone of digital communication.
	•	Translate: a multilingual AI system built before “LLM” was even a buzzword.
	•	Chrome: the digital gateway to Google’s data universe.
	•	Assistant / Gemini Apps: the evolution of Search — toward a multimodal AI companion.

⸻

🚗 VI. The Future Factory: Moonshots (Other Bets)

🚘 10. Waymo
	•	Perhaps the most advanced autonomous driving platform in existence.
	•	Live commercial operations in U.S. cities — powered by Google’s Maps, AI, and sensor fusion.
	•	Long-term potential: robotaxi networks and AI-powered logistics.

🩺 11. Verily / Calico
	•	Focused on predictive healthcare and longevity research.

	•	Home to high-risk, high-reward projects: Wing (drone delivery), Loon (balloon-based internet), and more.
	•	A frontier lab exploring energy, robotics, and AI applications beyond Earth-scale problems.

⸻

🧩 VII. The Synergy Map

Alphabet isn’t a collection of companies — it’s a single, interlinked intelligence ecosystem:

Everything reinforces everything else.
	•	Search + YouTube + Maps → continuous data supply
	•	DeepMind + Gemini → optimize all systems
	•	Cloud + TPU + Quantum → computation backbone
	•	Android + Pixel → global user interface
	•	Waymo + Verily → future market expansion

➡️ The result: Google is not just a tech company. It’s an adaptive intelligence organism — an evolving, self-optimizing network connecting human knowledge, computation, and accessibility.

⸻

🚀 VIII. Where It All Converges
	1.	AI as the world’s operating system
Gemini + Android + Cloud = a ubiquitous AI companion spanning every layer of life.
	2.	Quantum–AI convergence
The first commercially viable hybrid quantum–classical cloud system may well be Google’s.
	3.	AI-native computing paradigm
Hardware (TPU, Willow, Pixel) and software (Gemini, DeepMind) merge into a unified AI stack.
	4.	Digital Twin Earth
Maps + Waymo + Earth = real-world modeling on a planetary scale.
	5.	Predictive Healthcare Revolution
Verily and Calico could redefine medicine through continuous AI and genomic insight.

2025-10-23 14:48:08,r/GOOG_Stock,Technical Analysis DD - Tell me if this daily update helps (Do I keep it going?),"from [Link](http://www.siriussignals.com) 

Today, there are signs of both upward momentum and potential near-term exhaustion for GOOG. On one hand, technical signals show a surge in buying interest that, historically, has been followed by gains. On the other, the recent strong streak of up-days hints GOOG may be overextended and, in the past, similar stretches have often led to short-term pullbacks.  
  
**Moving Average Momentum:**  
Very recently, GOOG's 16 Day moving average shot above its 23 moving average. In the past, when this happened, GOOG tended to climb about 0.64% the next day on average, with a high statistical confidence (p-value of 0.00275). This pattern has appeared 76 times in the past. This suggests a burst of buying interest.  
  
**Stretch in Up-Days:**  
When we look at the past 8 days for GOOG returns, more than 75% of these days were positive. If we had sold whenever GOOG showed this setup, the stock on average had losses of 0.27% per day, with a high statistical confidence (p-value of 0.00931), across more than 126 cases.

2025-10-22 21:09:57,r/stocks,Everyone’s chasing NVDA，but Google just dropped the biggest AI news of the year,"So this one really caught my eye today.

Google says it’s developed a new quantum algorithm called “Quantum Echoes” that apparently runs 13,000 times faster on their quantum chip than the most advanced classical algorithms on a supercomputer.

It’s not just some “look how cool our tech is” moment either.

They’re saying it could help map molecular structures for drug discovery and design new materials ，which, if true, would make this one of the first real-world quantum computing applications we’ve seen so far.

I still remember when they announced the “Willow” chip last year, claiming it solved a key qubit issue. This feels like a continuation of that storyline ，one step closer to commercial use.

Now, obviously, it’s still early and there’s always a ton of hype around quantum anything, but it does make me wonder how this might eventually tie into AI. If quantum chips start boosting AI processing down the line, that could shake up the entire tech stack ，maybe even how we value GOOG compared to NVDA and MSFT.

For now, I’m just watching how the market reacts.

Google’s been lagging behind the flashy AI names lately, but news like this could quietly shift sentiment over the next few weeks.

&gt;Oct 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Monday it has opened a preliminary probe into about 2,000 Waymo self-driving vehicles after reports that the company's robotaxis may have failed to follow traffic safety laws around stopped school buses.

&gt;NHTSA said the Office of Defects Investigation opened the review after flagging a media report describing an incident in which a Waymo autonomous vehicle did not remain stationary when approaching a school bus with its red lights flashing, stop arm deployed and crossing control arm extended.

&gt;The report said the Waymo vehicle initially stopped beside the bus then maneuvered around its front, passing the extended stop arm and crossing control arm while students were disembarking.

You’ve got to flip between news terminals, Twitter, SEC filings, market scanners, watch cnbc/bloomberg to get a sense of wallstreet's sentiment etc. By the time you piece things together, the move is usually already gone.

I ended up building a platform for myself that pulls everything into one place in real-time. Figured I’d share it here in case it helps others:

* **Street Insight:** AI that watches CNBC/Bloomberg interviews in near-real-time, pulls key quotes, tags tickers, and scores sentiment so you know the street’s take at a glance.
* **Live news feed:** Bloomberg, Reuters, CNBC, WSJ headlines, Trump tweets in one stream
* **Analyst ratings:** upgrades/downgrades as they happen
* **Price action alerts:** stock spikes 2% in 1 min, oversold rsi, pivot support/resistance levels etc.
* **Company info:** SEC filings, insider activity, press releases
* **Alerts dashboard:** type in a ticker or keyword and instantly see why it’s moving
* **Front page briefing:** market overview, leaders/laggards, up-to-date news/ratings summaries, etc.

I originally just hacked this together for my own trading, but now it’s running pretty smoothly so I put it online. It’s free to use, no paywall. If you log in, you get real-time stock data and push alerts so you don’t have to refresh the page again and again.

I’m still iterating on it, but it’s already been super useful for catching moves early (like when an analyst upgrade hits or a filing drops mid-day).

Curious if anyone here would find this useful / what features you’d want added?

2025-09-20 20:07:12,r/stocks,The Future of RDDT Stock,"Hi everyone, I wanted to open up some discussion on RDDT stock. I think a lot of people are investing for the wrong reasons, have it wrong, or are misguided about the company. I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.


1. Data Licensing

First of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing’s 24% growth rate.

This means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.


2. Advertising

This is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.

User growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&amp;A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.

This post is actually getting long as hell, so I don’t want to go on too much longer, but I’ll finish off with where I’m most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that’s what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don’t even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.

I am happy to include more based on everybody’s reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.

Ive been investing in stocks since 2021, always had little idea what I’m doing but with this incredible bull run lately &amp; with more hands on research &amp; thinking from myself I’ve started to make some very good gains. 

The issue is, I’ve never had much of a strategy, I’ve just bought arbitrary amounts of certain companies if I thought they were going to do well. 

Recently I’ve decided that I should employ a strategy whereby I have 85% of my portfolio in “core” growth stocks that are relatively safe. 

Things like: GOOG, ASML, UNH. 

And another 15% in “moonshots” like ACHR, NBIS or MSTR. 

The issue is, not counting pies, I currently have 33 individual holdings and I would ideally like to get these down to 12 max. 

I struggle knowing, however, when to sell. I’m up a good amount on some stocks but I feel like there could be more growth there. 

At the same time, it’s becoming almost impossible to manage 33 stocks at once effectively. 

How can I remain cold &amp; calculated? Should I just sell all my smaller positions now, take the money &amp; focus on my new strategy?",12,10,LucrativeThinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nlsjr7/investment_strategy/,1nlsjr7

By now they've gotten at/over, or very close to, 100% returns. Now some of them give dividends even if it's very little (BAC and GOOG), so it's more incentive to hold them even longer term. 

I ASSUME these companies (well most of them) will be around long enough for me to hold another 30ish years before I retire, which is currently where I'm leaning towards.....BUT that's my opinion, and I feel it'd be foolish not to take other views that I might not have thought of into account.

&gt;About 55% of the $106 billion backlog should convert into revenue within two years, he said. This number accounts only for existing commitments, not new contracts or customers that it expects to land. The unit saw a 28% increase in new customers quarter-over-quarter, Kurian said.

&gt;Nine of the 10 leading artificial intelligence labs in terms of size are now customers, Kurian said at the conference. That includes rivals of Google's own AI efforts like ChatGPT maker OpenAI, as Reuters first reported in June, and Anthropic, which was valued at $183 billion this month.

&gt;Cloud computing sales only accounted for 14% of Alphabet's total revenue last quarter, far less than the advertising that revolves around Google's search engine, but it is one of Alphabet’s fastest-growing business lines.

&gt;As the tech industry seeks to prove to Wall Street that AI can deliver returns commensurate with its hefty spending, Google Cloud has found itself in an advantageous position. The unit's rise comes as Google's core search business attempts to monetize new AI interfaces while battling regulatory challenges in Europe and the U.S. that could help rivals to gain ground.

However, I do think it's important to keep updated on negative information as well so we can make the best investment decisions, rather than blindly cheerleading.

I don't think this will materially affect Google's underlying value. This is literal pocket change. Also, this is the same song and dance that it's been through in the EU with this judge. From the article:

&gt;Ribera’s predecessor Margrethe Vestager warned then that only a “mandatory divestment” of part of its business would solve the issues.

2025-09-04 06:28:35,r/GOOG_Stock,[BofA Research] Alphabet still trades at a discount,"Historically, Alphabet has traded at a slight premium to the rest of the market (10-year average 22x forward PE vs. 18x for the S&amp;P 500).

However, recently, it has been at a discount, with the Alphabet trading at 20x as of 9/2/25; adjusting for the bump today, that's still only 21.8x, compared to the S&amp;P 500's 22x.

If you think Alphabet deserves to trade at the same multiple as the rest of the market, then it can crawl forward a little bit more, then move up and down with the rest of the S&amp;P 500.

If you think Alphabet deserves to trade at a higher multiple, as it historically has and as justified by its faster CAGRs, then a 4-point premium would put it at about $276. I think this should be the base case.

The bull case is that Alphabet ""wins"" the AI race and that it further accelerates its revenue and earnings streams, further allowing its multiples to expand across not just search, but also Youtube, Deepmind, Cloud, Waymo, and Other Bets.

Here’s how her top positions look right now:
	•	NVDA – +$383.51 (+929.05%)
	•	NFLX – +$418.00 (+458.53%)
	•	CAT – +$46.53 (+88.01%)

	•	TSLA – +$34.91 (+46.69%)
	•	K (Kellogg) – +$19.03 (+38.07%)

For context, if she had just put the same money into the S&amp;P 500, her account would be worth about $4,320 meaning she’s outperforming the index by roughly +5%. Even better, she’s beating me too since my own portfolio is about 2% below the index, she’s actually ahead of me by about +7%.

My other daughter (5yo) who started hers a year ago with $200 initial and $50/mo is outperforming the index by 4% as well. I give up. I’m hiring them to manage my accounts.

And there’s no reason it shouldn’t. It’s had excellent revenue and earnings CAGR, whereas AAPL has been flat for the last few years.

The primary explanation is the DOJ overhang suppressing GOOG’s valuation. But if the remedy is to end its exclusive search deal with Apple, that would be much more harmful for AAPL since that was nearly free revenue and it’s not clear from European data that the traffic acquisition costs are worth it to Alphabet in 2025 anymore. Moreover, even if Alphabet would otherwise pay for this TAC, removing this uncertainty and a relatively benign ruling would probably result in significantly favorable repricing.

People have been going bananas over it already in early previews — it's the [top-rated](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard/image-edit) image editing model in the world. Now, we're excited to share that it's integrated into the Gemini app so you have more control than ever to create the perfect picture.

# Maintain your look as you edit

[We launched native image editing](http://blog.google/products/gemini/image-editing) in the Gemini app earlier this year, and we’ve been working hard to improve it, with particular focus on maintaining a character's likeness from one image to the next. We know that when editing pictures of yourself or people you know well, subtle flaws matter — a depiction that’s ""close but not quite the same"" doesn’t feel right. That's why our latest update is designed to make photos of your friends, family and even your pets look consistently like themselves, whether you're trying out a 60’s beehive haircut or putting a tutu on your chihuahua.

Just give Gemini a photo to work with, and tell it what you'd like to change to add your unique touch. Gemini lets you combine photos to put yourself in a picture with your pet, change the background of a room to preview new wallpaper or place yourself anywhere in the world you can imagine — all while keeping you, you. Once you're done, you can even upload your edited image back into Gemini to turn your new photo into a fun video.",19,3,Prudent-Corgi3793,https://blog.google/intl/en-mena/product-updates/explore-get-answers/nano-banana-image-editing-in-gemini-just-got-a-major-upgrade/,1n16o0t

2025-08-22 19:34:54,r/GOOG_Stock,[Google Blog] Gemini has gotten 33-44x more energy and carbon efficient,"&gt;AI is unlocking scientific breakthroughs, improving healthcare and education, and could add trillions to the global economy. Understanding AI’s footprint is crucial, yet thorough data on the energy and environmental impact of AI inference — the use of a trained AI model to make predictions or generate text or images — has been limited. As more users use AI systems, the importance of inference efficiency rises.

&gt;That’s why we’re releasing a technical paper detailing our comprehensive methodology for measuring the energy, emissions, and water impact of Gemini prompts. Using this methodology, we estimate the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses 0.24 watt-hours (Wh) of energy, emits 0.03 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (gCO2e), and consumes 0.26 milliliters (or about five drops) of water1 — figures that are substantially lower than many public estimates. The per-prompt energy impact is equivalent to watching TV for less than nine seconds.

&gt;At the same time, our AI systems are becoming more efficient through research innovations and software and hardware efficiency improvements. For example, over a recent 12 month period, the energy and total carbon footprint of the median Gemini Apps text prompt dropped by 33x and 44x, respectively, all while delivering higher quality responses. These results are built on our latest data center energy emissions reductions and our work to advance carbon-free energy and water replenishment. While we’re proud of the innovation behind our efficiency gains so far, we’re committed to continuing substantial improvements. Here’s a closer look at these ongoing efforts.",34,0,Prudent-Corgi3793,https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/measuring-the-environmental-impact-of-ai-inference,1mxcyd3

The long-term partnership was announced today at the Made by Google event, with Curry joining the company as a “performance advisor” for Google’s Health, Pixel, and Cloud products, leaning into his athletic experience and expertise.

&gt;Part of Curry’s job will involve testing and providing feedback for Fitbit’s new personal health coach, sharing “coaching methods and philosophies” that can be used to improve the feature, according to Google’s press release. The health coach is a Gemini-based chatbot that generates customized workout routines and metric targets for Fitbit app users based on the health goals they’re working towards.

&gt;“This hands-on work has already begun, with Stephen and his team of experts working with our health experts and product and AI engineers to test our new products and experiences, giving us incredibly valuable feedback,” says Google’s platforms and devices head, Rick Osterloh. “Stephen’s elite insights and our AI technology aren’t just for sports — our work together will show how anyone can use these products and features to maintain a healthier lifestyle and get more done.”

&gt;As expected, this partnership also means Curry and his team will be contract-bound to use Google’s hardware portfolio, including Pixel phones, watches, and earbuds. Curry is also implementing AI tools like Google Cloud’s AI Basketball Coach into his student training programs, which Google says can help to “perfect your jump shot” — something Curry probably doesn’t need much help with himself, with a 42 percent average on three pointers for his career.

2025-08-21 01:55:09,r/GOOG_Stock,Some context on a moderately disappointing week,"This has been a relatively disappointing week for big tech, including for GOOG, after a blistering runup the last few months. However, GOOG still remains materially undervalued and it may benefit as it's a growth stock still priced like a value stock.

For most of last year, GOOG would move with the rest of the market on good days, but it would dump like crazy on bad days. However, things may have recently changed.

On the first graph is the stock action of GOOG relative to several benchmarks--SPY, the tech-heavy QQQ, and the even more tech heavy MAGS ETF. I've also included the actively managed IVES and ARKK ETFs for benchmark comparison only, not that I would recommend anyone invest in them. These plots and the total returns shown in the legend are for the month of August, but they are normalized relative to 8/15/25, when GOOG made a relative high close of 204.91. Because I chose the relative high for GOOG, that means the action this week looks less favorable for GOOG, but it's still held up quite well compared to the benchmarks (in addition to having the bigger run up this month).

On the second graph is the stock action of GOOG compared to the rest of the Mag 7. It's performed better than all but AAPL and TSLA for the month, but keep in mind those two stocks are seeing a bit of correction after a disappointing 2025 and remain down -7.09% and -14.60% YTD. GOOG's price has also held up since 8/15/25 better than all but TSLA. Keep in mind that if we normalized every stock to its relative high (340.84 on 8/12/25 for TSLA, similarly for the other five), the difference woudl look even more pronounced.

In other words, GOOG is now moving up on good news and not dumping as hard on bad days. In other words, it is behaving like a growth stock in good ways but has had the downside protection of a value stock on bad market days, as it should given its criminally low P/E ratio.

[**WULF (TeraWulf)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WULF&amp;p=d)\-GOOG increased its financial backstop to $3.2B and expanded its potential equity stake in WULF to 14%. This exploded last Thursday and has been driving higher ever since, but we've close to doubled- watching $10 level at the open to see if we test/see where we go from there.

[**UNH (UnitedHealth Group)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&amp;p=d)\-Day 2 (4 if counting weekend) of the Buffett/Berkshire Hathaway stake disclosure (\~$1.6B). Still undervalued, but STILL has the DOJ case as a looming threat. Considering that BRK is willing to invest even with the DOJ as an overhang has probably assuaged investors/the market that UNH is a worthy investment, and thus the run. I'm mainly interested in the $300 level (though completely possible we never even touch that price today.

2025-08-16 19:18:08,r/GOOG_Stock,"[Google Research] Achieving 10,000x training data reduction with high-fidelity labels","&gt;Classifying unsafe ad content has proven an enticing problem space for leveraging large language models (LLMs). The inherent complexity involved in identifying policy-violating content demands solutions capable of deep contextual and cultural understanding, areas of relative strength for LLMs over traditional machine learning systems. But fine-tuning LLMs for such complex tasks requires high-fidelity training data that is difficult and expensive to curate at the necessary quality and scale. Standard data-intensive approaches to training models are costly, especially given the need to handle concept drift as safety policies evolve or as new types of unsafe ad content arise. In the worst case the model must be retrained on a completely new data set. Reducing the amount of training data needed is therefore paramount.

&gt;With this in mind, we describe a new, scalable curation process for active learning that can drastically reduce the amount of training data needed for fine-tuning LLMs while significantly improving model alignment with human experts. The process can be applied to datasets of hundreds of billions of examples to iteratively identify the examples for which annotation would be most valuable and then use the resulting expert labels for fine-tuning.

&gt;In our experiments, we were able to reduce the scale of training data needed from 100,000 to under 500 training examples, while increasing model alignment with human experts by up to 65%. Production systems using larger models have seen even greater reductions in data scale, using up to four orders of magnitude less data while maintaining or improving quality.",3,0,Prudent-Corgi3793,https://research.google/blog/achieving-10000x-training-data-reduction-with-high-fidelity-labels/,1ms1ibj

[**GOOG (Alphabet)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG&amp;p=d)\-OpenAI is set to launch an AI-powered web browser, potentially named ""Aura,"" integrating ChatGPT-like features. This move could challenge Google's dominance in the browser market and impact its advertising revenue model. We saw GOOG move on the announcement of Perplexity's development of a web browser, so today will likely see GOOG moving down as well depending on how well the presentation goes. If the presentation doesn't have any revolutionary features, I'm more interested in looking at a GOOG long.

[**SRPT (Sarepta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SRPT&amp;p=d)\-Announced a strategic restructuring with a 36% workforce reduction (\~500 employees) and projected $400M in annual cost savings, also moving due to FDA mandating a black box warning for ELEVIDYS, which SRPT complied with. This spiked massively premarket but I want to continue watching this- the black box warning is actually a positive sign because it means that it'll be allowed to stay on market despite causing patient deaths. Future risks are potential for further adverse events related to ELEVIDYS, regulatory scrutiny, typical risks when dealing with biotech.

[**TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSM&amp;p=d)\-Reported Q2 net profit of $13.52B, a 60.7% YoY increase, surpassing expectations. Revenue reached $31.7B, TSM cited robust demand for AI chips. It is selling off premarket (remember that they essentially report overnight since TSM is Taiwanese) so not too interested in this beyond how it affects NVDA/AMD/semis. Also the entire semis sector is on a tear due to loosening trade restrictions with China.

2025-07-10 19:37:40,r/stocks,"How screwed is $GOOG, really?","Perplexity and OpenAI are both supposedly going to “challenge” Google’s search business, and that’s rattling investors everywhere.

This is interesting because Google’s total ad revenue in Q1 2025 was $67bn and Search contributed for nearly 74% of that. And, according to the DOJ filings in the ongoing antitrust case, **about 35 % of all Google search queries originate inside Chrome**, driving “billions in Search revenue.”

Meaning, three-quarters of every dollar Alphabet makes still flows through ads, most of which *start in a browser tab.* Every point of share that Chrome loses risks a direct dent in Alphabet’s main cash engine. Barclays estimates a 5-point loss of Chrome share could shave **&gt;$3 B off quarterly Search sales.** That’s a big dent.

However, It’s good to know that all the commotion so far is still - *just commotion*. For reference, Google has dominated the browser race since the introduction of chrome in 2008, with a \~68% global share. The next in line is Edge with a \~13% share. 

Additionally: ""Historically, only \~20% of Google searches were monetizable. With Al-driven personalization and intent inference, this funnel is expanding.""

https://preview.redd.it/x9frloax13cf1.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf8ecc1063d22b2d57009bdd1fab03b207f5a77b

Coming to the \~15% drop in $GOOG, Q1 saw double-digit top-line growth and a fat 34 % operating margin for Alphabet. Yet sentiment is ruled by forward risk, and the stock is now priced at \~17x forward earnings. 

The public sentiment about who’s leading the AI race changes every other week, but Google’s Gemini is almost never last in any list. This, combined with Google’s already pretty big stronghold on the search and browser business means they have a significant advantage over the competition when it comes to AI **and** browsers. (it’s pretty well known that Google has implemented AI into chrome for a good while now)

Search(ads) and browsers are Google’s moats. Google knows this, and they haven’t stopped innovating. 

Looking ahead, the hard catalyst is the antitrust ruling for Chrome in August. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s browser is supposedly weeks away, and Perplexity’s ‘Comet’ is already in Public Beta. ",0,0,alwayshasbeaen,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lwixnh/how_screwed_is_goog_really/,1lwixnh

2025-07-02 02:19:23,r/stocks,OpenAI says no plans to use Google's self-developed chips,"Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)-backed OpenAI has no active plans to use Alphabet unit Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) tensor processing units, or TPUs, the company said following media reports that the AI startup was planning to use rival Google's chips to meet growing demand, Reuters reported.

A spokesperson for OpenAI told the news agency that OpenAI is in early testing with some of Google's TPUs, but it has no plans to deploy them at scale right now, the report added.

OpenAI is actively using Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs, and AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) AI chips to power its growing demand, the report noted.

A potential deal for Google's TPUs could have marked a supplier diversification for OpenAI, which has relied on Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips in the past to train its AI models and for inference computing. On Monday, analysts from Morgan Stanley said in a research note that potential usage of Google's chips for inferencing OpenAI's AI workloads would have been a significant endorsement of Google's hardware.

Over the weekend, it was reported that OpenAI has started using Google-made AI chips to build its products. However, it was noted that Google was not providing the most powerful TPUs to OpenAI, signaling its plans to use its most advanced versions to power the company's internal projects, including its own large language model Gemini.

Last month, OpenAI, reportedly, signed a deal with Google Cloud for the AI company's computing needs.",98,19,thelastsubject123,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lphw97/openai_says_no_plans_to_use_googles_selfdeveloped/,1lphw97
2025-06-27 14:25:43,r/stocks,An A1 question,"$MSFT, $AMZN, $CRM, $GOOG and a bunch of other companies are slashing jobs left and right -- because of AI (they've named the scourge in their statements). 

Right now, it's good for stockholders, because lower margins (ie people) mean a more streamlined company, which means potentially a growth in the company's value. 

But for me, the long-term growth in AI (apart from an utterly depressed world) will mean - long-term - that stocks will hurt because people won't have jobs to go to, won't be able to earn any money, and therefore won't be able to pay into pension funds. Pension funds in turn will lessen in influx of capital, so they have less to invest. The circle gets worse and worse. 

I've heard many-a-person tell me: ""Remember the internet? Remember how many people said jobs would be lost because of that, and how they came back?"", but my biggest question is this: What will the job landscape look like around the world if AI is killing everything around it? 

Do we expect college-aged kids to go and work in the cornfields and do cleaning jobs because they can't find work after leaving college. More's the case, we're also going to see unpaid student debt rise beyond all measure....and the death of many-a-college.

The other side of it is that there will be a limit to how much can be cut, and unions stop AI killing every job in the world, leading to a more socialist world but one that sees more people employed.

2025-06-25 14:40:36,r/stocks,OpenAI’s Self-Driving Ambitions (with TSLA and GOOG),"&gt;The artificial intelligence company has set many challenging goals. Autonomous vehicle software is now among them - but may pit the company against Tesla.

&gt;

&gt;Sam Altman has made many big claims about what OpenAI will be able to do, including spearheading ultra-expansive data centers and building artificial intelligence that can rival the abilities of Ph.D. holders.

&gt;But he also recently made a significant, yet largely overlooked, assertion. OpenAI is seeking to crack the code for advanced autonomous driving.

&gt;“We have some new technology that could just do self-driving for standard cars way better than any current approach has worked,” Altman said last week on the “Uncapped With Jack Altman” podcast, which his brother hosts. Altman added, “If our A.I. techniques can really go drive a car, that’s pretty cool.”

&gt;The technology is in its early stages - DealBook hears that it involves both OpenAI’s Sora video software and its robotics team - but commercializing it is still a distant goal. An OpenAI spokesman declined to comment.

&gt;That could make Altman even more of a competitor to Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but has since waged war on the company. (A short reminder: Musk has sued to try to stop OpenAI from revamping its corporate structure, and he’s building a direct competitor, xAI, that’s raising - and spending - billions of dollars.)

&gt;Autonomous vehicles are key to Musk’s vision for Tesla, which he increasingly sees as the producer of huge fleets of fully self-driving cars. Tesla is focusing on A.I.-powered vision rather than on the array of sensors like lidar that Waymo, a Google spinoff, uses.

&gt;One big question mark for OpenAI: Where will its systems get their data? Tesla and Waymo have already amassed huge amounts of information and video through their years of driving on the roads.

&gt;That raises the question of whether OpenAI believes in a fundamentally different approach to self-driving tech, one that relies less on real-world data and more on advanced simulation, synthetic data or a breakthrough in “generalizable” A.I. Of note: The company recently collaborated with Applied Intuition, a start-up focused on putting A.I. in cars.

&gt;(OpenAI’s venture arm also invested in Ghost Autonomy, a self-driving start-up, though the business folded last year.)

&gt;“I think he really gets it,” Altman said of President Trump’s approach to A.I. (Altman has forged close ties to the president, including by donating to his inauguration fund and announcing the Stargate data center project at the White House.) “I think he really understands the importance of leadership in this technology.”

&gt;Altman was uncertain about whether the right A.I. regulations would come to pass: “I have become a bit more, jaded isn’t the right word, but it’s something in that direction, about the ability of policymakers to grapple with the speed of technology.”

&gt;Altman played down reports of tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft as they rework their relationship: “Do you believe that, when you read those things?”

2025-06-07 23:40:08,r/stocks,"Earnings up, yields up   is Trump’s $3T bill a bull trap in disguise?","Everyone’s watching the Musk vs. Trump drama like it’s the main event, but markets should probably be paying more attention to what’s actually in Trump’s $3T “big beautiful bill”  because it’s very much alive and moving forward

Despite Musk calling out GOP lawmakers, threatening primaries, and warning about the deficit (which, by the way, multiple analyses say will balloon by $2.4T+), the bill’s still on track. Thune and Senate leadership basically shrugged him off. They’re pushing this thing through  and fast

Here’s where it gets interesting from a market angle:

They're talking about cutting back the $40K SALT deduction to save money. But whatever they save might immediately get canceled out because there's also strong pressure to make temporary business tax breaks permanent  stuff like R&amp;D deductions, bonus depreciation, and interest expensing

That’s a huge deal if you're long big-cap tech, industrials, or healthcare. These tax breaks boost reported earnings pretty directly. If they go permanent, EPS estimates probably move higher without companies having to do anything operationally. Think MSFT, LMT, UNH  names like that

But here’s the tradeoff: the bill’s already inflationary. If they don’t pay for it, bond yields are going to feel it. So while stocks might get an earnings tailwind, valuations could stay capped or even compress further if the 10Y starts creeping above 5% again

And the AI provision buried in the bill? Wild. Originally it said states couldn’t regulate AI for 10 years — a total federal preemption. Now they’re walking that back to a softer “you lose broadband funding if you pass certain laws” version. Doesn’t matter much fiscally, but for megacaps like NVDA and GOOG, this is one less regulatory headache. The moat just got a little deeper

One curveball that could raise the cost: Section 899. It lets the president slap taxes on foreign countries seen as ""discriminatory."" Some senators want to remove it, which could limit future revenue and geopolitical leverage. Not a today problem, but if you're watching defense and energy stocks tied to foreign trade, it matters

And now there's infighting about Medicaid cuts. Josh Hawley’s out here writing NYT op-eds saying this bill punishes working-class voters while handing corporate tax cuts. He’s not totally wrong. If the GOP starts shifting back toward economic populism, how long do these business-friendly tax policies actually last?

So here’s the real market question buried in all this: Are we about to get an earnings boost that the bond market completely wipes out?Because if you’re buying the earnings upgrade but ignoring the debt story  you might be trading the right trend with the wrong multiple",1132,226,KenKneeHee,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1l5vyh4/earnings_up_yields_up_is_trumps_3t_bill_a_bull/,1l5vyh4

2025-06-06 10:48:06,r/stocks,$GOOG is successfully transitioning from a search company to an AI company,"For years, we've known Google as the king of search. But if you think that's their only game, you're missing the massive shift that's happening right now. The idea that Google's money will soon come from a lot more than just search isn't some far-off prediction—it's already happening.

Sure, search still pays the bills. But Google is aggressively building its future around some seriously impressive AI, and it's all starting to pay off. What really sets them apart, though, is their secret weapon: the power to weave their best AI, Gemini, directly into the Google search bar everyone already uses.

# Google's ""Unfair"" Advantage: Upgrading Search for Billions

This is the kicker. No other AI company, not even OpenAI, has this kind of advantage. Google can take its powerful Gemini AI and plug it straight into its search engine. Imagine, instead of just typing keywords and getting a list of links, you have a conversation with a super-smart AI that gives you direct answers.

Google can slowly shift billions of us from the classic search page to this new AI-powered experience. They don't have to find new users; they're already on Google's homepage. This means Google can test, learn, and improve its AI with more data than anyone else, creating a feedback loop that will be almost impossible for competitors to catch.

# So, is Gemini Actually Better Than ChatGPT?

That's the big question. While people love to debate which AI is ""smarter,"" it's a bit more complicated. Both are incredibly good, but they have different strengths. The key for Google is that Gemini is getting really good at being accurate and not ""hallucinating""—which is the creepy AI habit of just making things up. You can't have an AI powering the world's search engine if it's spitting out fiction. So, Google's obsession with factual accuracy is exactly what's needed for the next generation of search.

# It's Not Just Search, Though. Google's AI is Everywhere.

Google's game plan is much bigger than just upgrading its main product. They're building entire businesses around AI:

* **A Personal Expert for Your Documents (NotebookLM):** This might be one of the coolest, most useful AI tools out there. You feed NotebookLM your own documents—reports, articles, class notes, whatever—and it becomes an expert on *only that information*. It will summarize, answer questions, and even give you citations, all without pulling in random stuff from the internet. It’s a game-changer for anyone who has to wade through a lot of text.
* **Self-Driving Cars Are Here (Waymo):** While a lot of companies are still just talking about self-driving cars, Google's sister company Waymo is actually doing it. With millions of miles driven on real roads, their cars are already on the streets of several cities, operating as a ride-hailing service. They are, without a doubt, the leader in the self-driving race, which could be a monstrously huge business.
* **The Powerhouse in the Background (Google Cloud):** All of this AI magic needs a ton of computing power, and that's where Google Cloud comes in. Its revenue is skyrocketing (up 28% in one recent quarter) because thousands of other companies are paying Google to use its powerful infrastructure to build their own AI tools. It's a classic ""selling shovels in a gold rush"" strategy, and it's working beautifully.

This kind of massive pivot isn't new, and the smartest companies have done it before. Look at Apple. It went from being a computer company on the ropes to the most powerful force in mobile by seeing that the future was in devices like the iPod and iPhone. Or consider Netflix. It started as a DVD-by-mail service and made the terrifying decision to blow up its own profitable business to lead the charge into streaming. They knew that if you don't disrupt yourself, someone else will. What Google is doing right now is playing from the same book. It's using its current strength to build what comes next, ensuring that as the world changes, it will be the one driving that change, not just reacting to it.",0,0,Dismal_Ad6347,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1l4nkwf/goog_is_successfully_transitioning_from_a_search/,1l4nkwf

Tesla (TSLA) stock slumped again on Thursday as the fallout continued to emerge from the very public policy blowout between President Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

""Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL,"" Musk posted on X on Wednesday.

Musk added, ""If the massive deficit spending continues, there will only be money for interest payments and nothing else!""

The vocal criticism is irking Trump, the Wall Street Journal reported, with a senior official claiming that White House advisors were ""caught off guard"" by Musk's latest broadsides.

Tesla stock fell solidly on Wednesday and extended those losses in premarket trading on Thursday, down as much as 3%.

The comments come after the one-time leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) waded earnestly into the debate over the bill this week, angrily posting Tuesday that it was a ""disgusting abomination.""

""I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,"" he said.

""Shame on those"" who voted for it in the House, Musk added.

Bloomberg reported that Musk may also be driven by the fact that the federal EV tax credit is being phased out by the bill, as he fought hard to keep it in place as a key driver for Tesla's business.

Musk's barrage comes as the bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate, and a Congressional Budget Office estimation of its impact on the deficit adds fuel to Musk's line of argument.

The nonpartisan office projected the House-passed version of the bill would add $2.4 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years.

The formerly Musk-led DOGE itself has been criticized for not producing the budgetary cuts Musk touted it could find, and the cuts it has produced have been deeply unpopular.

Musk's closeness to the Trump administration had been seen as a boon for Tesla, given its business with SpaceX and NASA and the regulatory levers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could pull in getting autonomous driving rules in place for Tesla's robotaxi testing.

But demand weakness in the EU and recent protests at US Tesla showrooms have followed Musk's controversial foray into politics, causing some Tesla owners to become alienated by Musk, specifically by his right-leaning tendencies, DOGE, and outward support of President Trump.

Tesla's big robotaxi test is slated for June 12 in Austin. Much of the company's value is tied to whether it can fully unlock autonomous driving for robotaxi purposes and individual owners.

Meanwhile, Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Waymo continues to plow ahead and is essentially the leader in the space, accumulating 250,000 robotaxi trips per week.",1374,82,callsonreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1l3yldf/tesla_stock_falls_again_as_musks_kill_the_bill/,1l3yldf

Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) stock could drop between 15% and 25% if US District Judge Amit Mehta orders Google to sell off its Chrome browser, Barclays analysts wrote in a note to investors Monday.

In August 2024, Google lost a landmark antitrust trial against the US Department of Justice. Judge Mehta found the tech giant guilty of monopolizing the search engine market — specifically, the markets for ""general search"" and ""general search text"" ads, which are ones that appear at the top of the search results page, Yahoo Finance’s Alexis Keenan reported.

Last Friday, Google and the Department of Justice wrapped up closing arguments in the remedies phase of the case. The Department of Justice argued that Mehta should force Google to divest its web browser, Chrome, and share its search data with rivals as well as ban its exclusivity agreements that secure Google as the default search engine on mobile devices and browsers, Keenan and Yahoo Finance’s Dan Howley reported.

Barclays analyst Ross Sandler wrote in a Monday note that “the probability of a Chrome divestiture, while low, has increased in our view,” following the closing arguments, adding that “the most likely candidates” to buy Chrome would be “well funded AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic or perhaps Perplexity.”

Sandler said such an outcome would be “a major blow” to Google, given that Chrome has 4 billion users and represents 35% of Google’s search revenue.

“This would be a major development, a black swan event for GOOGL shares,” he said. “Shares would obviously trade off significantly if this were to play out as no investors we speak to are thinking this remedy plays out.”

Sandler said a Chrome divestiture would not only cause Alphabet stock to tumble as much as 25% but would also result in a potential 30% hit to Alphabet’s earnings per share.

“The reality is we don't know what the court is going to decide on remedies, we listened to the entire day of closing arguments and there were certainly times where we felt a lot worse than we did prior, and other times where we felt better (in terms of GOOGL stock price impact),” Sandler said. He holds an Overweight rating on the stock.

Mehta is expected to decide on a remedy in the case — and the fate of Google’s search empire — in August. Google said Saturday that it will appeal the case.

Separately on Monday, Alphabet said it agreed to spend $500 million to change its compliance structure in order to settle a case with shareholders accusing the company of antitrust violations.

Nvidia’s Q1-FY2026 results may be noisy, but I’m not hedging it; I own shares, remain long-term bullish and will ignore earnings volatility, and may even add more.

Institutional or other investors who emphasize Blackwell absorbing H20 losses (About $13 Bn in lost annual sales and $5.5Bn in chargebacks for unsold inventory-due to the government ban on H20 exports to China) may be trying to thread the needle, **either believing that the markets will not be happy with the Blackwell ramp or the speed of the ramp to mitigate these lost sales. But for a company that is firing on so many cylinders, I’m sanguine about the Q1-FY2026 results, and am absolutely positive about the long-term prospects – it’s business as usual for the best of the best. This is a once-in-a-lifetime** opportunity, and for once it’s not a cliche.

The momentum around inferencing, and the computing power needs for inferencing and reasoning models suggest that Nvidia’s is a supply problem – and even if the $ 200 Bn revenue estimate for FY Jan 2026 is off by a small percent, FY 2027 to FY 2030, will more than make up for it. 

Morgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore, who has an Overweight rating and $160 price target on Nvidia, said the Jensen Huang-led company is likely to be fine if it can show investors that rack supply has accelerated.

**“Our data points would suggest that in recent weeks, the full year rack forecasts have started to be revised upwards by 50 %+,” Moore added, citing recent channel checks that suggest the issues have been resolved and are now starting to show up in numbers.**

**Additionally, investors appear to be underestimating the “unprecedented explosive token growth” commentary coming from Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), Moore posited.**

**“Every hyperscaler has reported unanticipated strong token growth,” Moore explained. “But our conviction is not driven by that, it’s driven by the fact that literally everyone we talk to in the space is telling us that they have been surprised by inference demand, and there is a scramble to add GPUs.”**

Moore continued: “This is not driven by the limitless aspirations for training megaclusters fueled by highly speculative venture capitalists; **this is proof that the models are being used, and driving revenue,** which mitigates the biggest overhang on NVIDIA stock that this is all driven by venture funding that will dry up. **The strength we highlight here is driven by usage, by the revenue-generating part of the business, and provides proof points that the scaling of inference as we move to reasoning-oriented models is a real thing.** We are seeing this spanning geographies, as well, so published concerns about China having stockpiled H20s seem inaccurate.”

**I think Nvidia will have a similar overwhelming market share and growth in inference GPUs and their 1 year product roadmap ensures that they remain ahead of the competition– this is just the beginning.**",89,64,Fountainheadusa,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kx5azw/nvidias_longterm_prospects_remain_terrific_im/,1kx5azw

2a: invest in stocks with associated risk but also good reward over 3 years like UNH, AMD, AVGO

2b: invest in options of tickers with lesser risks but continued stable growth for aggressive return like BABA, WMT, TSMC

3. 30% (9k) for buy the dip or DCA into above strategy. 

I would love your feedback on:

A. Over strategy and percentage distribution. 

B. Tickers I have in mind vs others 

C. Anything I have missed in general. Is this sustainable along with a job and family. 

Thanks again and appreciate your feedback. I expect to make these purchases over the next 2 weeks and do a few house cleaning things:

1. Track overall and stock level daily move of anything more than 2% to make adjustment
2. Monthly tracking of anything that moved 5% 
3. Follow broader markets news and adjust cash reserves accordingly. A little lower if outlook looks good and hold at 30% if it’s same. Don’t want to go more than 30% at any point. The idea is to play safe but not to play very very safe. 
4. Limit hopium and fomo, don’t expect magic before or after buying.

The stock has been punished for fears it seems to be:

1. Out of the AI race (it's not, Gemini is fantastic)
2. Search is dead (it's not but it probably will be given enough time. However, it could easily be like tobacco companies that have great margins and exist for decades as solid businesses without growth due to personal habits)
3. Will be broken up

This last point is fascinating to me because as I understand it, if it were to be broken up, shareholders would receive shares in all of the constituent parts. 

Meaning, I would get a shares in GCP, YouTube, Search, Waymo, etc. I would LOVE to have shares in any of those businesses individually. 

The article below values all of Google's businesses at a staggering $3.7 trillion.

2025-05-08 21:36:09,r/stocks,Sum of the parts Valuation for Alphabet (GOOG/GOOGL),"We've all seen plenty of Google posts on Reddit, but most of the comments are a single line thesis about how they're super undervalued or how they're the next Kodak. 

I'm interested in your sum-of-the-parts valuation for each business segment. Let's see some details though, not just ""Waymo is really cool so it's worth a trillion dollars."" Let's see your estimates for growth, your price to earnings/sales, your DCF's, etc... 

I'd love to see a few compelling arguments from the bull perspective and the bear perspective, show me what you think! 

Edit: I'll start with mine. 

Search- Assuming search grows around 3-4% per year based on a combination of falling click-through rates and raising prices. I would assign around a 10x multiple for the earnings for the huge uncertainty on the horizon. Margins are incredible however, I would estimate around 40%, possibly higher. This would equate to about 80 billion in profit, so let's say search is worth around 800B.

YouTube- TTM ad revenue around 36 billion, I'm hesitant to say this is high margin given the creator ad revenue split and the high hosting costs. However, with 125 million premium subscribers making them approximately 12-15 billion per year, let's just say the ads revenue sustains them at break even, and the subscription is pure profit. Assign a 30x earnings multiple (fair for the huge moat and pricing power), and you get somewhere near a 400B segment.

Cloud- The future crown jewel of Alphabet IMO, it's difficult to say what sort of margins they can achieve in the future, but AWS and Azure are IMMENSELY profitable. Let's assume 30% to be conservative? I also think GCP will average around 20% growth for quite a while, given their custom hardware and AI tools. I hate using price to sales, but I would happily pay 12x revenues for the multiple expanding moats, rapid growth, and enormous profitability. That puts cloud at around 540B. 

Google networks- shrinking business that's significantly less profitable than search, so we'll assume maybe 20% profit margin? I'd say 7x earnings for an estimated 6B per year business that is slowly shrinking equates to around 40B.

Other -We'll just sum up every other operating segment into one giant ball here. You have Waymo, platforms/devices (already discussed youtube subscriptions), Google one subscriptions, and other somewhat un-monetized services like Gmail, maps, Gemini free versions, etc. It's extremely difficult to arrive at a conclusion with any precision here, so let's be conservative and say all of this is worth around 75B or so?

Balance sheet and ventures- the balance sheet has ~300B in shareholder equity right now after zeroing out goodwill. Let's be ultra conservative and assume the total worth of their cash, equipment, buildings, land, fiber, satellites, data centers, etc. is around 100B net of liabilities. Ventures include partial ownership of SpaceX, Anthropic, stripe, and other very promising companies. Again, we'll err on the side of caution and say around 20B of value in their ventures portfolio? 

So, in total, this gives me a current value of just under 2 trillion with what I think are very conservative estimates. I believe basically every segment could underwhelm, and you'd still end up with a respectable return in 10 years time.

2025-05-04 15:22:13,r/stocks,Why I am extremely bullish,"I know this may contradict prevailing sentiment but I hope you can at least hear me out. I’ve been buying the tariff dip on margin, with $1.4 million invested in blue chip stocks. I’m up 46% in the past month. My largest buys have been in TSM, NVDA, ORCL, CAVA, AMZN, MSFT, META &amp; SMH.

1. Largest tax cut in history is coming. Republicans own the house and senate, and Trump is deadset on cutting taxes by $5 trillion. Obviously not good for the national debt but that will juice the economy big time. 

2. Midterms are coming in 2026, and Trump will not want to have a recession on his hands which would risk him loosing the house and senate. I am fully convinced he launched this tariff war so early on, so he could get it over with before midterms. Trump has pivoted extremely quickly on all reciprocal tariffs aside from china. And he is desperate to start negotiations with china. China and the U.S have both entered a de escalatatory tone, with both sides  making exemptions to tariffs, china expressing willingness to deal with fentanyl, and acknowledging the desire to negotiate- along side acknowledging that the U.S has reached out to them. They are BOTH eager to water down these tariffs and deep down, when both parties want the same thing (reduced tariffs) they will find a way to get it despite all the public bluster. Even if a deal could take months, they will likely have a pause either during or before negotiations. 


3. Rate cuts are coming later this year. It’s likely there will be at least 2 rate cuts before year’s end assuming tariff inflation does not cause extreme inflation. Rate cuts will boost the ability to borrow capital, increase liquidity and stimulating the economy. 

4. We are at the dawn of the largest productivity revolution in history. Everyone has seemed to forget about AI despite big tech earnings and guidance blowing it out of the park. MSFT, GOOG, and META are printing money, and AI is showing incredible returns in the semiconductor and data center space. We are still in the early stages of AI, the smarter it gets the more productivity will increase. 

5. The economy is currently strong. Jobs numbers in April (not a lagging indicator) were impressive. At the end of the day, so long as people are not losing their jobs the U.S consumer will stay resilient. Tariff effects could disrupt that if they stay in effect long term. However I think it’s pretty obvious the worst of the tariffs are temporary. 

6. U.S exceptionalism is nowhere close to ending. We are miles ahead of every other economy in terms of innovation and technology. We lead in services, and nobody is boycotting GOOG, META, MSFT etc in a significant way. These innovative tech companies exist nowhere else in scale and success. Our consumer is 30% of the global economy and nowhere do they have such a wealthy large pool of consumers. We are still the world reserve currency with 59% of currency held abroad is dollars.

2025-05-01 16:56:53,r/stocks,why (you) should steer clear of META / GOOG (from a professional marketer),"\* Meta has enshitiffied its platform to unreal levels in the past two years to reverse the revenue trends seen right after corona. Meta has artificially increased the cost of advertising on its platform through allowing enormous amounts of bot traffic. This translates into clicks but not sales for advertisers, being not sustainable in the long run. For more info, lurk the PPC and facebook ads subreddits.

\* Meta is losing users in the first world and especially the US. They make up this numbers on the figure they give through adding more third world users on instagram and whatsapp, but these users are not valuable to advertisers. They stopped reporting user numbers for this reason.

\*Meta is quickly losing ""sophisticated users"" ie those who won't tolerate endless AI slop / high engagement rec feed / extreme ad saturation to other platforms such as Reddit or Pinterest or Discord. These numbers won't show yet on those platforms yet because advertising budgets per platform are reactive, and it's hard to convince your boss to advertise on a platform he hasn't heard of.

In a couple quarters you will see META bleed revenue like there's no tomorrow, followed by a desperate steer towards quality that will bleed even more revenue. Zuck has walked into a trap trying to harvest his userbase for short term profit and in return he has killed the platform.

This news happened afterhours yesterday (which is why all the car companies had a weird spike at the close). This is a rehash of the 25% tariff on all imported cars which was announced ahead of 'Liberation Day', so I don't think this should ultimately shouldn't have a massive effect on these stocks unless there are additional tariffs. 25% tariffs on imports of automobiles/automobile parts have been known for a while, so at this point I'll wait to see how car companies react at the open. The highest risk at the moment are retaliatory tariffs from Canada.

[**INDA (India ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INDA&amp;p=d)\- Pakistan has suspended all trade with India, closed its airspace to Indian airlines, and rejected India's claims regarding a Kashmir attack, escalating tensions between the two nations. The geopolitical tension between the two countries has been going on for close to 100 years, watching to see if there's more escalation between the two countries.

[**AAL (American Airlines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAL&amp;p=d)\- American Airlines reported Q1 earnings with an EPS of -$0.59 vs. -$0.69 expected and revenue of $12.6B vs. $12.5B expected. The company withdrew its FY outlook and provided weak Q2 guidance based on current demand trends. Interested in $9 level. Overall bearish but no position. AAL has fallen close to 50% since February, so I'm mainly interested to see if there is any chance of economic turnaround. There are some knock-on effects from tariffs due to fuel costs/economic prosperity of travelers for discretionary spending. Risks are typically continued persistently weak demand and operational disruptions (further plane accidents).

If it's the latter of the three, feel free to correct me.

For the past weeks I have seen so many people saying they are holding cash because they point out it's plainly and clearly obvious that in the coming months tariffs will finally take effect and that's when the true hurt will begin. The stock market is still overpriced. The V shape recovery after a crash is a lie this time! A true recession is where stocks will be down for years. Europe hasn't even retaliated yet. The true people who are 20+ aged investors and lived through 2008 know it's time to hold cash and wait. Even Warren Buffet is holding cash!

All pure speculation in my view. If I asked you right now what Trump's next move is, what Xi Jinping's next move it, if there will be a trade deal between USA and China, if Trump is backing down now due to advisors, can you answer any of these with certainty? Can you also tell me that when GOOG, NVDA, UBER, META, AMZN, XOM, etc all report earnings they will tank rather than go up and bring the markets up? Where exactly is the market bottom?

Just stop. Just like how today I can't tell you we are going back to a bull market with reaching ATH by the end of the year because we just had two massive days of rallies and Trump saying he is going to be soft on China with reports that his advisors were shitting the bed about the economy, you equally can't call the opposite about bull traps or whatever. What I can tell you is that you just missed a bunch of blue-chip stocks that were trading for one of their most undervalued prices ever. You should have been buying a week ago, you should be buying now, you should be DCAing stocks you have conviction in until they reach a price you believe is overvalued and you find a better opportunity in another.

As recession fears mount following [Trump's sweeping new tariffs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/trump-tariffs-live-updates-semiconductor-and-pharma-probes-proceed-eu-talks-make-little-progress-191201243.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall), US media and internet companies face a potential multibillion-dollar hit to ad spending that could potentially deliver the death knell to traditional television advertising.

""Given the ongoing secular headwinds facing the linear TV ecosystem, we worry that television could mirror the fate of radio and newspapers during past recessions,"" MoffettNathanson analysts Michael Nathanson and Robert Fishman warned in a report last week.

[If a recession were to materialize](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html), MoffettNathanson estimates US ad spending would come in $45 billion below current forecasts.

That estimate would mean an 11.5 percentage point blow to top-line revenue growth across the media landscape. Digital platforms would bear the brunt, realizing $29 billion less in ad spending, with TV facing a $12 billion shortfall.

Even before the [Trump administration's April 2 announcement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/president-trumps-bold-trade-action-draws-praise/) of a 10% baseline tariff on nearly all foreign imports, MoffettNathanson said companies were already in wait-and-see mode, holding back ad spending while trade policy remained unclear.

It's a stark reversal from the significant spending rebound the advertising industry enjoyed in 2024 on the back of record political spending, a booming economy, and lingering momentum from the post-pandemic digital and e-commerce boom.

But as MoffettNathanson argued, the tone has shifted from ""softly pessimistic"" to ""significantly more bearish.""

""The shift is driven largely by the current administration's unorthodox and aggressive approach to addressing 'unfair' trade practices,"" the analysts said. ""The heightened uncertainty following the tariff announcement has led us to adopt a more cautious outlook for advertising.""

# Best and worst positioned

Companies heavily reliant on advertising — like Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), Snap ([SNAP](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNAP)), and the Trade Desk ([TTD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TTD)) — would be hit ""disproportionately harder,"" with projected stock declines of at least 30% each, the firm estimates.

Digital players with variable cost structures and less reliance on advertising, like Netflix ([NFLX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX)) and Alphabet ([GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG), [GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)), are ""better positioned to weather the storm.""

Meanwhile, connected TV player Roku ([ROKU](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ROKU)) would see the biggest relative impact, flipping from positive earnings in 2024 to a net loss in both 2025 and 2026, according to MoffettNathanson's projections.

Paramount could also reverse recent positive earnings trends, and other traditional media names like Disney ([DIS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DIS)), Fox ([FOX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FOX)), and Warner Bros. Discovery ([WBD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WBD)) would likely see earnings per share (EPS) declines of around 20% to 25%.

As earnings season kicks off, some clarity on the outlook may emerge. But if a US recession takes hold, a drop in ad spending could send lasting ripple effects across a broad spectrum of companies, regardless of their size.

As a UBS analyst said in a separate client note sent Tuesday: ""Advertising is usually the first to go in an economic downturn as companies look to cut expenses.""",1,0,callsonreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k373ib/television_could_go_the_way_of_newspapers_if_the/,1k373ib
2025-04-18 09:57:08,r/stocks,What will be the fate of Semiconductors and Tech?,"So we all saw how much these companies can grow in favourable economic environment. 

What I'm wondering is what will happen in the next months. I assume their revenue growth might slow a bit, but not substantially, at least in the Q1 and Q2 earning reports. Therefore I can hardly understand why the tech and semi companies are falling even harder than the overall market. 

Additionally, the trend is towards more digitalisation, automation, and AI usage, which should all speak for rather more need for such companies, and not less. 

I'm of course aware that the WH is currently an attention seeking drama queen. And that the dot com bubble bursted even though the internet is insanely useful. However, what I don't understand is why the potential on a global scale that Tech and Semi have is being mostly overshadowed by the current market conditions?

Yesterday I just witnessed Google’s breakthrough with image and video generation while tinkering with their new experiment. The more I think, the more the following scenario makes sense:

* Google has unlimited access to YouTube, which gives them edge over others on training video related GenAI

* YouTube has already a proven business model based on user created content with ads or subscription.

* I can see that with GenAI tools from Google, it’ll be possible for people to create “professional” content; short movies, series, animes. Some of them will be hits.

* End game, YouTube will take a big portion from the movie/series market, both watching and also production.

* At some point this might mean big studios and distribution channels (including Netflix) will loose some market to YouTube.

* I expect this to become visible by the end of 2026: A couple of GenAI series, created by a very small team (say 5-10). No actors, just skilled labor.

* I expect the quality and quantity to increase in the next 3-5 years

Based on this outlook, I’m just thinking to simply buy Google stock. But I’m stupid and whenever I buy stock, I loose money. What could I do? Is YouTube important enough for Google that this might boost the stock value?

Hey everyone,

After years of bouncing between trends, missing some massive moves (energy in 2022, early AI), and learning from crashes like 2020 and 2022, I’ve built what I hope is a **macro-resilient, globally balanced, thematic long-term portfolio**.

It’s designed to:

* Withstand **2020-style collapses**
* Endure **2022 inflation + rate shocks**
* Thrive in **AI, robotics, green energy, space, and aging population megacycles**
* Hold through decades — **not just years**

Would love your takes, critiques, and improvements.

[Gold](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/investing/article/gold-price-today-wednesday-april-16-2025-gold-opens-with-new-high-134956304.html) has surpassed the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks as the most crowded trade on Wall Street as the precious metal surged to record highs this year amid volatile markets and an uncertain economic backdrop.

According to the latest Bank of America fund managers survey published this week, nearly half of the fund managers surveyed (49%) see long gold, or bets that gold prices will rise, as the most crowded trade in the market right now. This marks the first time in two years that fund managers did not see the Magnificent Seven as Wall Street's most crowded trade, according to the survey.

Gold futures ([GC=F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GC=F/)) on Wednesday rose to an all-time high of $3,334 as investors continued to [favor the safe-haven asset](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-notches-best-week-since-2020-amid-shaken-investor-confidence-in-us-201546983.html) amid a falling US dollar ([DX-Y.NYB](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!HIhgXKgPRojUSTTqYlaKSTMqCnabU-_BFJYcQNg1l9bJcllZ1Gp3LtN-1O0pcbknpYvKz0DBczt7-zHHf99GDzXJ1VfxDc7wuw$)) and tariff uncertainty.

Gold prices have surged more than 27% year to date, while the Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL), [GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)), and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) — are down considerably.

Tesla stock has led Magnificent Seven losses and is down about 38% since the start of 2025. Apple stock has fallen 21%.

Nvidia stock has also declined 21% year to date. On Wednesday,[ the AI chip giant warned of a multibillion-dollar ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-dives-as-chipmaker-sees-55-billion-hit-from-surprise-china-chip-controls-130319576.html)impact from US export controls on China, which weighed on shares.

Shares of Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon — the remainder of the Magnificent Seven — are all down by double-digit percentages since the start of the year.

Gold's rally comes as [central banks' demand hit all-time highs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-demand-hits-record-levels-as-central-banks-buy-at-eye-watering-pace-205945413.html) last year and as investors increased inflows into physical gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

""The new highs in gold are signaling a shift in appetite for US assets,"" Ryan McIntyre, senior managing partner at asset manager firm Sprott, recently told Yahoo Finance.

""Confidence in the US has clearly been shaken, so people are looking to diversify.""

Wall Street analysts have remained bullish on gold, [upping their price forecasts ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-keeps-upping-its-bullish-calls-on-gold--heres-why-162732492.html)on the precious metal even amid its fast ascent.

Some 42% of fund managers expect gold will be the best-performing asset of 2025, up from 23% in March, according to Bank of America.

The firm's survey also showed investors have rotated out of US assets by a record amount over the past two months, with 73% of respondents saying ""US exceptionalism"" has peaked.",455,9,callsonreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k0nih7/after_surge_to_record_highs_gold_overtakes/,1k0nih7

News: [Trump Weighing Tariff Options As Rose Garden Event Nears](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-01/trump-weighing-tariff-options-as-rose-garden-event-nears)

# Trump speaks at the Rose Garden at 4PM EST today- be on the lookout for incremental headlines or anything that is passed on from his admin.

A sign of escalation and a warning, China is essentially responding in kind that it will give tariffs back (just like 2018). Reduced Chinese investment could result in less liquidity in the markets overall and larger volatility. If you want to see a reminder of how Chinese stocks performed when we got into a trade war, look at 2018-2019. We haven't a seen a meaningful move in these stocks yet, but if there are responses from China in kind to the tariff announcement today, things are going to get volatile,

[**SPY (S&amp;P 500 ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&amp;p=d), [**QQQ (Invesco QQQ)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&amp;p=d), VXX, etc. - President Trump is set to unveil new tariffs today but is still finalizing details. Options include a tiered system (10%-20%) or a flat 20% global tariff. We're likely going to see a LOT of incremental headlines today on this until Trump speaks in the Rose Garden; I'll be watching what he says on the websites he posts on, and going for the speed trade on this. He is expected to talk at 4PM Eastern. Obviously, a lot of volatility and uncertainty due to no one knowing what exactly the tariff plans are going to be. The imposition of new tariffs could escalate trade tensions, leading to retaliatory measures from affected countries (which we don't know the extent of how many are affected) and impacting global economic growth.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d)\- Tesla reported preliminary March China deliveries of 78.8K vehicles vs 89.1K YoY. The company has delivered 336,681 cars in the first quarter, far fewer than the 390,000 expected. The decline in Tesla's China deliveries was a bit of a signal that the global sales would be bad, but frankly this wasn't as terrible as I expected. Currently short, will cover if we break $260 to the upside. Also interested in the $250 level. You guys know the risks by now (BYD and competitors, Musk, politics, etc).

No real move in these stocks yet but I expect any news headline that is negative for TikTok to be great for the companies I'm watching (social media rivals). A ban on TikTok could alter the membership for the social media sites mentioned (they have to go somewhere). Since this is a weekend headline, I'm thinking of buying more GOOG- if TikTok DOES get banned, then these companies will likely gain. Otherwise, business continues as usual and they don't benefit. .",27,21,WinningWatchlist,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jpoamx/interesting_stocks_today_042/,1jpoamx
2025-04-01 08:04:12,r/stocks,All CEO trades for Tsla Pltr Goog Pfe in new Insider trading charts site,"So I wanted to post this when there was really low traffic because I don't know how much traffic My server can actually support. Basically, you can go to the SEC Edgar's database and see every single CEOs buying and selling within about 24-hour notice. That's not the hard part. The hard part is that all the data is so government red taped that it's a pain in the ass to read then calculate. And CEOs use that to their advantage to hide when they dump their own shares. One of the ways they do this is by exercising options then selling the same amount of shares. What ends up happening is that it looks like they didn't sell any shares at all but what they really did was buy shares at like a 90% discount that were entitled to them by the board of directors from way back when then sell the same amount of shares that they've been holding. So they're dumping stock without their net holdings numbers changing. Anyways, there's a whole bunch of different ways they try to game the system and hide their moves. 

All that's been super clarified and transparentized. 

I'm going to leave a non-clickable link so that it keeps the traffic to a minimum and nobody thinks I'm a spamming but before you go buying a whole bunch of stocks or even crypto, I recommend that you look for insider trading. I specifically selected these companies because the CEOs of these companies are the closest to the Pentagon, Trump, and US senators. Palantir for instance knows more about the world than the CIA or mi6.

2025-03-25 23:14:10,r/stocks,Stocks Close Higher for 3rd Straight Day; Tesla Surges in Late Trading to Extend Rally,"
Major indexes closed slightly higher Tuesday as the stock market continued its recovery from an extended selloff.

The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose fractionally. Stocks had kicked off the week with big gains following news that President Trump could scale back some of the tariffs that are due to be imposed next week on U.S. trading partners. With the recent gains, the Dow has inched back into positive territory for 2025, as stocks have rebounded from a month-long selloff spurred by concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.

Investors brushed off consumer confidence data released this morning that came in weaker than expected, with the index hitting its lowest level in more than four years. Investors are closing watching all data points amid worries that tariffs could reignite inflation and cause economic growth to stall. The big economic report of the week comes Friday with the scheduled release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had fallen during the recent stock market rout amid the growing concerns about the economy, was at 4.32% in late trading, down from 4.33% at yesterday's close and from an earlier high Tuesday of 4.37%. The yield, which affects costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, hit its highest level in more than a month this morning.

Mega-cap technology stocks, which helped lead Monday's rally, were mostly higher again today. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied late in the day to finish 3.5% higher, gaining ground for the 5th consecutive session, despite news Tuesday that the EV maker's sales in Europe continued to slide. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) each rose more than 1%, while Microsoft (MSFT) inched ahead. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) closed slightly lower

2025-03-21 01:54:15,r/stocks,Short sellers have made $15 billion betting against Tesla and Nvidia in 2025,"Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Tesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven — which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) — is underperforming the S&amp;P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

Now, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.

""Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,"" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. ""But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market. They are not going away.""

TSM has proposed a joint venture to Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom to operate Intel's foundry division, with TSM managing the operations but holding less than a 50% stake. We saw INTC make a decent bounce in the overnight yesterday on that news, but it looks like we're giving back most of those gains. This move comes as Intel faces significant losses in its manufacturing division, the CHIPS Act is targeted by Trump, so frankly a very good positive catalyst but I don't expect much to come of this. The possibility of a joint venture between these 4 companies actually happening seems fantastical, especially with Trump stating that he wants to scrap the CHIPS Act and instead work on tariffs on semis.

Loop Capital has maintained a buy rating on Reddit Inc. (RDDT), citing strong core fundamentals and a 71% year-over-year sales growth. I don't normally pay attention to these buy/sell ratings but I did notice this was during one of the worst selloffs for RDDT and the market downturn, so it was *a little* more significant than normal.  The company's stock has experienced a nearly 50% decline from recent highs within the past month. I thought this was interesting yesterday near the open so I bought some stock, overall still holding but interested to see where it goes after the open. Also worth noting, Reddit's plans to monetize its subscriber base are expected to boost revenue (I see them competing with Patreon/Substack/Onlyfans). This is overall a pretty positive catalyst, not much risk to it beyond additional negative news coming in for the broader tech sector.

I'm also long NVDA a little more- GOOG hasn't pulled back as much as I expected compared to NVDA, but this is pointedly good news. We're also seeing a minor market bounce but whether that can hold is up in the air. Going to sell out if we break new lows in the market. Another model in the arms race that can be run on a SINGLE device is massive news, especially considering the model's competitiveness with Deepseek R1. This is overall positive news but there's always the chance that Deepseek releases an even better model in the future even though the $13M training costs have been debunked.

2025-03-11 18:12:13,r/stocks,Trump's DOJ wants a Google breakup but is willing to leave AI alone,"President Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, now largely agree on a major point that has the potential to reshape the tech world: Google should be broken up.

But there is an important difference that emerged in a filing last Friday: Trump’s Justice Department wants to let Google (GOOG, GOOGL) keep its investments in artificial intelligence. It notably has a stake in OpenAI rival Anthropic worth billions.

Backing off the Biden administration's request to force Google to sell off its AI bets was ""significant"" and ""very justified,"" said Mark McCareins, a business law professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.

It ""may be an indication that the government worries about deterring AI advances in the global race with China,"" added David Olson, associate law professor at Boston College Law School.

The stock of Google's parent, Alphabet, dropped more than 4% Monday as other tech stocks also sold off on macroeconomic concerns.

The final decision on what happens to Google's $2 trillion empire in court will be in the hands of federal judge Amit Mehta, who ruled last August that Google illegally monopolized online markets for ""general search"" and ""general search text.”

No matter what Mehta decides, Google is expected to appeal, and the DOJ can too. Hearings to decide on remedies in this case are slated for April and May.

Final remedy recommendations from the government and Google were due to the judge Friday, giving a Trump-led DOJ one last chance to alter the prior Biden-era suggestion to the judge that Google be broken up with the forced sale of Google’s Chrome browser or contingent sale of its Android operating system.

It didn’t do so, despite being lobbied by the company to reconsider the Chrome proposal on national security concerns.

""Google must divest the Chrome browser — an important search access point,"" the DOJ stated in its final proposal on Friday.

It argued that under a different owner, new rivals would have an “opportunity to operate a significant gateway to search the internet, free of Google’s monopoly control.”

They also retained part of a request to leave the door open to a possible divestiture of Google's Android operating system.

But prosecutors did drop the Biden DOJ's push for Google to sell off its AI bets, instead suggesting a setup where federal authorities could keep tabs on proposed AI investments that could threaten search competition.

Anthropic has argued to the judge that forcing Google to relinquish its stake would tilt the AI playing field in favor of OpenAI and its backer, Microsoft (MSFT).

“Plaintiffs no longer seek the mandatory divestiture of Google’s AI investments,” the DOJ said Friday in its revised proposal.

Derek Mountford, a shareholder in Gunster's business litigation practice group who specializes in antitrust litigation, said while the Trump administration's AI rollback is a concession, it comes with a hook.

""They're asking for some reporting requirements to be attached to it,"" he said.

""I think one of the [antitrust] themes you might see in a second Trump administration is even if they're walking back some of the proposed sanctions, there's still that element of control and monitoring and enforcement that's going on in the background.""

The tension for the Trump administration, Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich told Yahoo Finance last week, is that it is engaged in an existential fight with China for the future of AI and Google can still be an important weapon for the US.

""What are we going to do, hobble one of our main US runners in that race by breaking up that company?” asked Kovacevich, who previously led Google's US policy strategy and external affairs team.

""It seems ill-timed to do that.""

The DOJ did stick with another expected remedy proposal that strikes at a major contention in the case.

It asked the judge to block Google from contracts that secure its search engine as the default across dozens of internet-connected devices, such as mobile phones made by Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and others, and browsers, including Apple’s Safari and Mozilla’s Firefox.

That is not good news for Apple, jeopardizing a major revenue stream. In 2021, Google paid $26 billion for default search placements, and the lion's share of that went to Apple.

Bernstein analysts have estimated Apple’s revenue from Google Search defaults is somewhere between $18 billion and $20 billion per year.

Google countered the DOJ’s request on Friday by asking that it still be free to enter into contracts to make Google search a default — so long as it does not condition search licensing based on device manufacturers also agreeing to distribute, preload, place, display, use, or license its AI Gemini Assistant Application.

McCareins, the law professor at Kellogg, said the DOJ has little to lose at this stage by holding on to Chrome divestment as a negotiating chip, given that both the underlying case and the judge's decision on remedies are subject to appeal.

""Just from a bargaining negotiating position, at this stage of the proceedings, I am not shocked or stunned that the new sheriffs in town have continued to argue for divestiture of Chrome,"" McCareins said.

2025-02-15 03:34:47,r/stocks,How I Pick Stocks. Anyone Else?,"For stock selection I just look at charts: going up is good, going down is bad. Add in that you've at least heard of the company. And that it's relatively big.  

Walmart is my benchmark these days.  Have a look at its [1-year &amp; 5-year charts](https://imgur.com/a/gHcW2K8).  Up and to the right.  And smooth.  That's my kind of stock.  

How do you find them?  By looking at a bunch of charts.  Just qualitatively, like a 5th grader would.  Is it going up, and is it smooth over, say, a year?

One way to find them is to look at the best-performing S&amp;P500 sectors, then find the best-performing stocks within those sectors.  

If you don't know of a way to do that, here's one:  
Go to Barchart.com.
Click on ""Stocks"" at the upper left.
In the dropdown, far right column, under Sectors, click ""Stock Market Sectors.""
Sort of in the upper left, in the dropdown box, change ""Today"" to ""1-year.""
The top sector is ""Communication Services,"" up 35.2% over the last year. Click on it.
Scroll down the page until you see the list of stock symbols.
At the upper right of that list in blue it says ""flipcharts."" Click it.
You might need a free membership, so sign up for that.
Now click ""flipcharts,"" and you're looking at a candlestick 6-month view of one of the 20-odd stocks in that group.
Upper left, change the time frame to 1Y.
Upper right, change Template to Line Chart, Percent.
(I hate the candlestick view, but keep that if you want.)

Now, *finally*, you have some charts to flip through. Only about 20, shouldn't take you more than 5 minutes your first time. You can click to the next chart at the upper right, or use the right arrow on your keyboard.

You're just looking for charts that look like Walmart's, up and pretty smooth.

Here's my take on the ones there today:  

CHTR, no. CMCSA, no. DIS jumped a lot in November, but isn't going up. EA, no.

**FOX**, boom! That's what we're looking for.
And FOXA (I don't know the difference.)

GOOG is sort of okay, but I don't like those 3 big drops.
LYV I mostly like.
META seems to be taking off.
NFLX maybe, but that big drop is scary.
Same with T (though I got in it November 11th, and still in).
TMUS that big drop is scary, but man, it's almost straight up since then. I'll probably get some of it Monday.

That's it. We looked at 22 charts. When you get used to it you'll do that in 2 or 3 minutes. Note the ones you like, then study them more after this initial scan.

That's really all there is to it. You're buying into strength, riding the trend up. But keep an eye on them, and when they start leveling off, find other ones to replace them.

And this was just one of the S&amp;P 500 Market Sectors. Other sectors are doing well too: Financials, Utilities, Consumer Discretionary, IT.  So scan those charts and see what you like.  

This is just finding the best-performing sectors, and then the best-performing stocks within that sector. It's very powerful.

Anyone else pick stocks like this?  
If not, give it a try and see what you think.

I believe in all of these stocks, but I'm wondering--should diversify by opening new positions in different sectors, or if I would be better off grow the positions I have now? Or is it diverse enough because it's many different companies?  For reference, this is roughly the breakdown of both portfolios. Should I continue to grow these positions (and if so, where would you focus? I really like Visa), or buy in other areas like NVO, etc?  Part of me feels like I'm ""supposed to"" diversify, but realistically I don't think Microsoft or Apple or Meta or going anywhere anytime soon, I think they all will continue to grow as they utilize AI in new ways, and the returns seem to have been pretty consistently higher than other sectors.  So is it worth it to diversify with other sectors?  Or is it already diverse because I have many different positions?

2025-02-05 16:29:20,r/stocks,Meta going to surpass GOOG in market cap by EOY even though it makes no sense,"Given current trajectories in both share price and valuation, i think META will pass GOOG in market cap by EOY or mid 2026.

I'm trying to rationalize it to myself but I can't - META doesn't even make 70% as much money (net income, if we go by revenue its about 55-65%) as GOOG and their ad business is like 2/3 the size (again, going off net income).  
  
Meta makes 98% of revenues from Ads, Google made around 73% last quarter. I understand that Meta is growing faster, but its advertising business is still not even 2/3 the size of Google and they have 0 diversification outside of ads, so i don't quite understand how meta is poised to surpass google despite being a smaller player in the advertising market and also being a one trick pony.

The key difference with these two stocks imo is that GOOG trades at a discount with the p/e in terminal decline since 2022 (its at 21 today and has been monotonically decreasing for almost 3 years now), while Meta enjoys a valuation expansion on top of its increasing earnings (goog increases earnings but valuation keeps contracting).

The stock market is about telling a story. The story around Google has been completely shit for three years now (AI is eating their lunch despite net income over $100b in 2024 - more than Apple and every other company on the market!) and I don't see what will cause that narrative to improve. In fact it will probably get worse. I can see Google tripling profits between now and 2030 while the p/e is cut in half, tbh

 
Imagine telling a Google bear on the eve of November 2022 after the release of ChatGPT that Google will make 100b in net income in 2024. They'd laugh in your face - search will be obsolete by then. The jury is out on this one, generative AI is not taking marker share and not causing a growth slowdown.

We've been asking this question for almost 3 years now, the answer has remained the same, yet bears keep on thinking that will change. When do you bears lose credibility? We've been hearing about the demise of Search for almost 30 months. At what point do you just admit that you're wrong and realize that LLM is orthogonal to search?
what are peoples thoughts?


EDIT:

A commentor posted this:
""google will never have half the PE of now, it cannot trade at average SPY PE, it has too much moat to be valued like any other SPY company""

Yet look at the facts today:

Current p/e ratio of the SPY: 27.71
current p/e ratio of GOOG: 21 - so google already trades at a STEEP discount to the market. I'm looking at the P/E chart and it seems that the discount is poised to just get worse over time? Pull up the chart of GOOG P/E over time, its in terminal decline for years now. It started the decade around ~30, halfway through the decade in 2025 its at ~21, it will be 10-15 by end of the decade at this rate

why is GOOG considered ""magnificent"" (the market thinks the business is lackluster considering the steep discount it trades at)? ",1018,101,AverageUnited3237,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iickrt/meta_going_to_surpass_goog_in_market_cap_by_eoy/,1iickrt

News: [Trump Tariffs Push Us Manufacturers To Rush To Beat Mexico Canada Fees](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-05/trump-tariffs-push-us-manufacturers-to-rush-to-beat-mexico-canada-fees)

**Ticker:** [**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** AMD reported EPS of $0.29 vs. $0.41 expected. Revenue of $7.66 billion vs. $7.5 billion expected. Ultimately said that data center segment revw will be down in Q1, but had clear positive outlook in 2025 and expected double digit revenue growth. This was what caused the stock to fall despite the initial spike.

**Technicals:** Watching $100 level, but doesn't seem to be an irrational move in my opinion. Note that we've moved from $150 to $107 in the past 3 months.

**Risks:** The vast majority of NVDA/AMD/every semiconductor's business's money comes from selling to businesses- individual consumers are a tiny slice of the pie despite gaming/client businesses growing, so I don't really pay attention to them (one exception is NVDA'S 50 series GPUs selling out within 5 minutes) . We also have threats from NVDA dominance, possible regulations from the US, etc, (Disclaimer: I generally don't invest in AMD)

**Related Tickers:** NVDA, INTC, QCOM

**Offhand Comments:** Overall doesn't seem to have affected NVDA or other semis much because what they cited was weakness that was exclusive to them and not the broader semis market.

**Ticker:** [**GOOG (Alphabet Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** GOOG/GOOGL reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings with an EPS of $2.12 vs. $2.12 expected. Revenue of $96.5 billion vs. $96.67 billion expected. Cited FAR more spending in CapEx and a miss in cloud revenue (which signals that other competitors have taken their market share)

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Market had a pretty negative reaction to the news that they'd be investing far more in capex and missed on cloud revenue (was roughly $9B vs $12B expected).

**Risks:** Elevated capital spending may pressure Alphabet's margins if the capex spending doesn't result in increased revenue, especially amidst increasing competition in the AI and cloud markets. I don't really see the China investigation to affect their stock price much, Google Search and Youtube are blocked in China and I doubt that China is going to let Waymo operate in their cities rather than creating their own solution.

**Ticker:** [**UPS (United Parcel Service)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UPS&amp;p=d)**,** [**FDX (FedEx Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FDX&amp;p=d)**,** [**PDD (Pinduoduo Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PDD&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** The U.S. Postal Service has suspended accepting parcels from China and Hong Kong following new tariffs imposed by Trump, affecting logistics companies like UPS and FedEx.

**Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in PDD because they own Temu, which focuses on shipping small/low-cost goods to the US and using the loophole for very low shipping costs.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The recent suspension by USPS may lead to increased demand for private carriers like UPS and FedEx to handle parcels from China. There are a number of Chinese companies that focus on shipping low cost goods (like PDD).

**Risks:** Heightened tariffs and trade barriers could disrupt supply chains, increase costs, and lead to potential overreliance on private carriers, which may face capacity constraints and regulatory scrutiny.

**Related Tickers:** XPO

**Ticker:** [**UBER (Uber Technologies)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UBER&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Uber reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings with an EPS of $3.21 vs. $0.48 expected. Revenue of $12B vs. $11.8B expected. Cited that they plan to do buybacks of their own stock.

**Technicals:** Watching $60 level, no bias.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Despite Uber's strong quarterly performance, they cited a potential $1 billion impact from a strong U.S. dollar on future bookings which results in worse earnings overseas.

**Risks:** Outside of self-driving cars (Uber partnered with Waymo to operate in Austin), currency fluctuations and international markets affect companies you wouldn't normally expect. This may move in future from tariff news.

**Related Tickers:** LYFT

**Ticker:** [**USO (United States Oil Fund)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=USO&amp;p=d)**,** [**BP (BP)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BP&amp;p=d)**,** [**CVX (Chevron )**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CX&amp;p=d)**,** **Other Oil Stocks**

**Catalyst:** Trump announced that the United States plans to take over the Gaza Strip, relocate its residents to neighboring countries, and redevelop the area.

**Technicals:** USO didn't move much on this piece of news, but if Trump actually makes this a policy then we might see a LOT more volatility in the future depending on how serious we get and if we get involved again.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The oil sector is sensitive to geopolitical developments in the Middle East, a region critical to global oil supply. Initial market reactions to Trump's Gaza proposal didn't impact oil prices. Not really a catalyst TODAY but worth thinking about in the future.

**Risks:** Potential escalation of regional tensions could disrupt oil production or transportation, leading to supply constraints and increased volatility in oil prices.

Yesterday was eventful, to say the least. Tariffs on Mexico/Canada are delayed, but we still have tariffs on China, and tariffs have been promised by Trump on the EU.

**Ticker:** [**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.14 vs. $0.11 expected. Revenue of $828 million vs. $777 million expected. Management highlighted the power of AI and their sizable contracts, citing the nature of the AI war being winner-take-all.

**Technicals:** PLTR absolutely exploded and hit $102 premarket, currently watching $100 level to see if we continue the move. Other than that unlikely to be trading this unless we have massive volume come in.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The PLTR ER highlighted the growing demand for AI-driven solutions across government/commercial sectors. Company emphasized securing substantial contracts in the competitive AI landscape, important because they are more closely aligned with the current government.

**Risks:** Obviously being more closely tied to the government means that it has more leeway to be more monopolistic/aggresive in their actions, Alex Karp and Peter Thiel are closely aligned with current government leaders.

**Related Tickers:** MSFT, GOOGL, IBM, AMZN

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Chinese AI company DeepSeek is reportedly preparing to switch to domestic GPUs to circumvent NVDA chip restrictions. DeepSeek has bypassed NVDA CUDA for certain operations, utilizing the PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) language instead. Additionally, on February 2nd, DeepSeek, in collaboration with SiliconFlow and Huawei Cloud, launched DeepSeek-R1/V3 inference services on Huawei's Ascend AI chips. Huawei is also promoting its new Ascend AI processors to Chinese groups considering ""inference"" as an option.

**Technicals:** After the insane move we've seen from $150 to $118, I actually don't consider this to be earth shattering news- China has always been trying to develop their own semis and not using NVDA for training is what they were ""supposed"" to be doing due to the trade restrictions. I'm still long but selling calls against my position, recovery might be slow for NVDA. It's interesting that they are attempting to bypass CUDA, which is essentially the ""standard"" for ML/AI training nowadays on NVDA chips and developing their own.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** DeepSeek's move to adopt domestic GPUs and bypass CUDA indicates they're aiming for technological self-reliance amidst U.S. export restrictions, rather than trying to adopt more NVDA chips (which presumably isn't a viable long term strategy).

**Risks:** Nvidia faces potential revenue loss if Chinese companies increasingly adopt domestic GPUs and alternative programming frameworks. The effectiveness of U.S. export controls may be undermined as Chinese firms develop workarounds.

**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM, TSM

**Ticker:** [**BABA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&amp;p=d)**/(oil stocks, car stocks, etc).**

**Catalyst:** U.S. implemented a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports, aiming to address issues related to drug trafficking, particularly fentanyl. In response, China announced retaliatory tariffs effective February 10, including a 15% tariff on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas, and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, and large-engine vehicles.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The imposition of these tariffs marks a significant escalation in U.S.-China trade tension and more volatility to come through Trump tweets- we might see a trade war again (sigh) like we did in 2019. Not 100% sure if agricultural machinery will affect stocks like DE but will look into it.

**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU, TCEHY, PDD

**Offhand Comments:** There are going to be retaliation investigations against companies operating in America, INTC and GOOG have recently been announced as under investigation by China. But it's very important to remember which companies have a presence in China and which don't- for example, GOOG search hasn't worked in China since 2010 lol.

**Ticker:** [**GRAB (Grab Holdings Limited)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRAB&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Grab Holdings Ltd. is considering a takeover of its Indonesian rival, GoTo Group, at a valuation of approximately $7 billion.

**Technicals:** Watching $5 level, no bias. I'm not 100% sure if there's an actual ""acquisition"" share price for GoTo but will keep eyes peeled for that acquisition premium.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The potential merger represents a significant consolidation in SEA's ride-hailing and food delivery sectors. Mergers typically streamline operations and reduce competition, leading to improved profitability for the combined entity.

**Risks:** The proposed merger may face regulatory hurdles, including antitrust concerns, which could delay or derail the deal. Standard M&amp;A obstacles.

2025-01-27 13:06:13,r/stocks,The Case for TSLA: the Business Value,"Many people consider TSLA to be overvalued based on fundamentals. Make no mistake - it absolutely is... based on fundamentals.

The value of TSLA, beyond the Twitter-political volatility, comes from its proven track record in achieving the impossible.

**Breaking Into an Otherwise Unbreakable Car Market**

How many new Western car companies can you recall successfully breaking into the market in the last few decades?

The only real answer is TSLA.

Everything else is bleeding money, a penny stock, or a YouTube car review channel side quest.

**Popularizing an Otherwise Undesirable and Impossible Product**

Before the EV boom, any consideration of a successful EV business would be immediately countered with legitimate concerns.

The car community wouldn't be very excited without their loud 4L V8 engines.

The product would be impossible to make as the batteries would be expensive, heavy, unreliable, and yield a low driving range. If you did get an EV, you wouldn't be able to charge it since there were no charger networks.

Not to mention the expected environmental returns from selling EVs, but generally disrupting the market and directing it towards sustainable energy cars. I love my fuel-hungry loud 6-cylinder German beast, but ICE engines in the mainstream have an expiration date and will eventually become a niche when the larger market transitions to EVs. TSLA takes the credit for this - singlehandedly. Everybody else follows.

**Scaling Up: Actually Selling Cars**

Tesla is [still leading](https://www.automotivedive.com/news/electric-vehicle-sales-us-2024-increase-cox-automotive/737528/) EV sales, and is in the [top 10](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/06/top-10-best-selling-cars-in-the-us-in-2023.html) of all car sales. Meanwhile, VW is closing down their factories in Germany.

**Advertisement by Word of Mouth**

You see Ford Focus 1.0 EcoBoost billboard ads everywhere in Europe, and RAM / JEEP / Chevy Silverado / F-150 / Hyundai / Kia ads everywhere in the US.

TSLA built itself on word of mouth and a vision for the future, which is a testament to its value for customers.

**Elon's Proven Track Record in Business**

[Winning](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/science/spacex-moon-nasa.html) NASA award contracts in competition with Blue Origin and other space companies, [catching](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp66ye6ep63o) skyscraper sized objects landing, and a Roadster [roaming](https://www.astronomy.com/science/astronomers-just-deleted-an-asteroid-because-it-turned-out-to-be-elon-musks-tesla-roadster/) through space are just a few of the business and technological achievements of Elon Musk (not to mention the side quests). With someone so unreasonably effective at building things that work, investors project that TSLA is a safe and promising bet.

How many reusable rockets has anybody else caught landing recently?

**Criticisms**

No product or company is without criticisms. From the bad build quality, to the still-unfulfilled FSD promises, to the lack of Cybertrucks in Europe, to the removal of the turn signal stalks; and most recently, the political criticisms.

**Consequential Actions, Not Ideologies, Drive the World**

The bottom line for a business is creating products and services that people love, and there are *zero* indicators that TSLA, as a business, is going anywhere. It thrives *despite* all criticism (of which I do think most is reasonable) and lack of marketing, which is a testament to the value they provide.

**Market Temper Tantrums Are a Feature, Not a Bug**

Look beyond the ephemeral temper tantrum-driven volatility of the market.

Last year, in March, GOOG dipped from 160 to 135 when Gemini generated some questionable images; today it's close to ATH at &gt;200.

Last year, in August, CRWD dipped from 380 to 220 when they pushed out a buggy update. (How dare they, a software company, pushing a buggy update?!) Today, it's trading close to ATH again.

Today, the market finally noticed DeepSeek and is going through yet another mental breakdown.

It is like a palm tree: it will bend but it won't break.

Learn to put your prejudices aside and buy companies that execute well - not companies with a nice little PR team that will sweet talk you.

**But Is It Overpriced?**

By traditional fundamentals analysis - of course it is. But we've already established there's nothing traditional about TSLA as a company, so your little P/E ratio calculations won't work. They have failed consistently.

Look at the execution of TSLA and compare it to its Western competitors - they aren't even in the same league.",0,0,Ordinary-Experience,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ib78ft/the_case_for_tsla_the_business_value/,1ib78ft

It seems like the cost of intelligence really goes down a lot, approaching 0. Well, not really, but a whole lot.

Now, I'm struggling to interpret what this means for the stock of AI companies which invested heavily in these models. 

On one hand, AI really works and is progressing rapidly. Suggesting there are further benefits to get from AI.

On the other hand. The intelligence commodity is really cheap now. The DeepSeek model's weights are free. And it cost only 10M to train. AI companies which invested Billions on their models, just got their models superseded by a model which is now free for everyone. This is bigger news than the meta llama models, because this model now was trained really cheaply and the license says you can do whatever you like with it. 

If the cost of intelligence will be 0, will the AI companies like Goog and msft make money out of their investments?",94,24,PunchTornado,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ho2a1j/impact_of_deepseek_v3_on_ai_stocks/,1ho2a1j
2024-12-25 06:31:07,r/stocks,Expensive Stocks vs Cheaper Stocks in Roth IRA,"Sorry in advance is this isn't allowed. Just trying to educate myself a bit more and this seemed like the best sub to ask this

Can someone give me advice on if it's better or worse to buy high priced stocks such as GOOG, APPL, JPM, COST, etc which are very high cost stocks vs cheaper stocks like WMT, CSCO etc. For context I am putting over 50% into SWPPX and SWLGX, I also have a pension and max out my Roth TSP, so I'm looking at my Roth IRA as more a place to be able to perhaps take more risk in it. I'm 41 and only just started my Roth IRA.

So my thinking is for example is it better to buy 2 shares of stock A at $200 per share or 8 shares of stock B at $50 per share, or no difference? I'm smart financially but not the best at stocks and in my brain it seems like stocks inherently have a ceiling and so lower stock of a strong company is better than higher stock of also a strong company.

* DoJ said, Google should divest off Chrome and may not reenter the browser market for five years
* prohibited from ""acquiring any interests in search rivals, potential entrants, and rival search or search ads-related AI products""
* halt all ""anticompetitive payments to distributors, including Apple, Samsung"" so that Google isn't the default search engine on their devices
* content creators can choose to opt-out of Google crawlers to train its AI

Most obvious historical comparison is case against Microsoft Corp. in 2001; the DoJ tried to split Microsoft up due to its hold over the web browser market on Windows, though this case **ultimately resulted in a settlement**. With that in mind, it is possible, the DoJ will go this way, this time.

* Search is close to 50% revenue of Google \[Q3 results\]
* Browsers market shares: Chrome 60%, Safari 18%, Edge 8% \[Source can be contested, because it's larger devices stats only\]
* Android - 70% market share in handheld devices

GOOG has to fight hard to ensure a high search traffic. It may have a few options up its sleeves.

2024-11-21 19:25:20,r/stocks,The Bullish case for OPRA,"With Google under pressure from the DOJ, this looks like a huge potential for Opera. If Google was forced to sell Chrome, this would give smaller browsers, like Opera, a great chance to gain some market share. Also, when you look at browsers, excluding Edge and Firefox, Opera has a pretty substantial user base by comparison. They are also one of the only ""browser stocks"" that there are. At least the only one of any substance. 



On the flip side, even if Google ISN'T forced to sell Chrome, then we should see the momentum continue for GOOG.

I’ve been a long term holder of OPRA for this very reason. They have a steady growing base of 350M users and are continuing to buy up smaller browser companies. I’ve always looked at OPRA as a hedge against GOOG, at least as far as their browser is concerned. It also pays to hold because they have a great divided.

I’ve been a long term holder of GOOG too though. I think both are great companies, but I’m buying both to more or less hedge my bets.

I think OPRA has a strong chance of seeing some gains if DOJ does follow through.

2024-10-31 18:13:27,r/stocks,Alphabet Deserves A Better Valuation,"**I had recommended Alphabet (GOOG)** [**as a great long-term buy at $150**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1anr3id/alphabet_goog_150_looks_like_an_excellent_long/), several months ago.

Last evening, Google knocked it out of the park with really stellar results. I bought more shares this morning, and am reiterating a Buy.

I believe analysts’ consensus earnings could be a little conservative and Google should continue to beat estimates with better growth and operating margins.

Google's earnings quality is better than several tech giants for the following reasons.

* It has a near monopoly in Search
* Market leadership in media with YouTube.
* A strong first-mover advantage with Waymo.
* A fast-growing Google Cloud business, third only to and catching up with Azure and AWS.

**Its earnings and growth are sustainable, thus it deserves a better valuation and multiple.**

Let's take a closer look at Q3 earnings.

Q3 GAAP EPS came in at $2.12 per share, beating expectations of $1.85 per share $0.27, or 14% - **This was a substantial beat.**

Revenue of $88.3Bn (+14.9% Y/Y) beat by $2.05B or 3%.

Consolidated Alphabet revenues in Q3 2024 increased 15%, or 16% in constant currency, YoY to $88.3Bn reflecting strong momentum across the business.

Google Services revenues increased 13% to $76.5 billion, led by strength across Google Search &amp; other, Google subscriptions, platforms, and YouTube ads.

**Total operating income increased 34% and operating margin percent jumped a huge 4.5% to 32%.**

Google Cloud revenues grew a whopping 35% to $11.4Bn led by accelerated growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) across AI Infrastructure, Generative AI Solutions, and core GCP products, **with record operating margins of 17%** as the cost per AI query decreased by 90% over the past 18 months.

Cloud titans Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft (Azure) have commanded huge valuations for their cloud computing businesses; with Google Cloud growing at 35%, it should continue to narrow the gap over the next 5 years. Also importantly, AWS and Azure have operating margins over 30%, and should Google continue to scale and leverage their existing fixed costs, they can reach the same margins. I also believe as they get better at AI, they should be able to charge more.

Based on consensus analysts’ estimates Alphabet’s EPS should grow to $11.60 in 2027 from $5.80 in 2023 - that’s an annual growth rate of 18%. Comparatively, Apple‘s estimated EPS growth through FY2027 is slower at 14%, and it sports a P/E of 33 compared to Google’s 22. Alphabet’s P/E is closer to the S&amp;P 500’s P/E of 21!

I believe this is too low, and there is a lot of potential for its stock to appreciate on the lower valuation.

Besides the strong EPS, a lot of Google’s expenses are noncash depreciation and amortization and their cash flow margins are strong. They generated operating cash of $31Bn on $88Bn last quarter, or a 35% cash flow margin.

The antitrust regulation will remain a possible negative on Alphabet, but the final decision is still years away as Alphabet vigorously appeals the decision.

My takes:

COST -- Costco has a great expansion model, a great business model, and loyalty like few other companies: customer, employee, and vendors.

AAPL -- I continue to see them innovate, they won't stick with something that isn't working, and their stuff just works.

Third slot is a bit tougher: GOOG, NVDA, or JPM in that order.

2024-10-23 14:35:32,r/stocks,Alphabet To $7 Trillion By 2025?,"We believe Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) is positioned to grow its valuation by well over 3x from the already huge $2-trillion figure now – potentially becoming the world’s most valuable company by a huge margin – as its often-overlooked Waymo autonomous driving business quietly revolutionizes the transportation sector. This would take the stock to over $500 a share. Here’s why.

Fact: Waymo has grown the number of weekly paid rides from 10,000 to over 100,000 in the last 12 months. It went from 50,000 weekly rides to 100,000 just in the last six months.

The growth is compelling and the addressable market is massive

Case in point: Uber does more than 200 million rides each week. Let’s let that sink in. So if autonomous rides can capture even half that market, that would mean 100 million rides per week. That’s about 1,000 times where Waymo is today. 200 million rides a week translates to about a billion a month and over 10 billion a year. At $30 per ride, we’re talking revenues of close to $300 billion per year.

But wait… there is more to the growth story

If Waymo is already delivering over 100,000 driverless rides, how many more people might switch from driving their cars to being driven by autonomous vehicles? The shift could be massive. For each person hailing a cab, there are at least 10 others driving their own cars. Many of these drivers might reconsider once they see millions of people relaxing in the back seat, streaming Netflix, while they’re stuck behind the wheel.

In fact, early data backs this up. According to Earnest Analytics, Waymo is already retaining riders at a higher rate compared to other ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft. People enjoy the experience of autonomous vehicles. Safety could also be another attraction. Waymo published a report last year indicating that its autonomous vehicles achieved an 85% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to national rates for human-operated cars.

Investors will soon recognize that the $300 billion revenue figure for the current ride-hailing market has substantial growth potential – it could easily expand by 2-3x. A $1 trillion market for autonomous rides isn’t out of the question. This growth would also translate to significant revenue opportunities for automakers like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which are working on their driverless vehicle technologies.

But wait aren’t so many automakers and tech players working on autonomous driving?

Yes, but not all of them are making the same progress. Waymo has a head start in the market. Its main competitor, General Motor’s backed Cruise lost its driverless permits in California after a serious accident, making Waymo the only publicly available robotaxi service in San Francisco. Uber exited its self-driving taxi program about six years ago and has partnered with Waymo to bring its services to the Uber app in some cities. While electric vehicle behemoth Tesla is seen as a leader of sorts in the self-driving space, given its large base of vehicles, it is only slowly getting into the space after the unveiling of its Robotaxi vehicle earlier this month.

Waymo has some advantages in terms of tech as well. It uses a fleet equipped with high-resolution cameras, LiDAR, and radar systems, creating a comprehensive view of its surroundings. And don’t forget Google’s got a secret weapon. It crowdsources annotated data such as CAPTCHA codes from its massive user base, using that to train its machine-learning models. That’s a big advantage in terms of understanding complex driving environments.

The best part?

These are self-driving cars – no human drivers, no unions, no employee or contractor issues, and no human cost. While there will be other expenses, such as software development and battery costs, the absence of driver wages could lead to exceptionally high margins. Margins of 50% aren’t unrealistic when you consider that driver earnings account for a substantial portion of gross fares in traditional ride-hailing models.

If Waymo can capture about one-third of the $1 trillion autonomous rides market, it could generate annual revenues of around $300 billion. With a 50% margin, that’s a neat $150 billion in profits. What’s that worth? At a 30x earnings multiple, that would imply an additional valuation of about $4.5 trillion for Alphabet. Considering that Alphabet is worth roughly $2 trillion presently, this could take the company’s market cap to over $6.5 trillion, or over $500 per share.

To be sure, building this sort of scale can take a good deal of time – quite different from signing up for say a Google or Netflix account. However, investors will need to look well out into the future. Think 2030 (not 2025), maybe even more. The point is not to get stuck – if you’re concerned, look even further out, say 2035! The bottom line: Alphabet is growing Waymo quickly, has the technology and competitive edge, and is addressing a potentially massive market, making this high valuation within reach.

2024-09-27 12:04:39,r/stocks,'Safety Disaster:' Tesla FSD 'Galaxies Away From Being Anywhere Close To Competition',"* Tesla's FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised, is now the core technology behind the robotaxi service the company plans to launch.
* Most analysts assign hefty value for the FSD technology alone.

  
With just two weeks to go for Tesla, Inc.’s TSLA Robotaxi unveil event, an analyst painted a bleak picture of the company’s self-driving technology.



**What Happened**: Tesla’s FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised FSD, is a “safety disaster” and “galaxies away from being anywhere close to the competition,” said GLJ Research’s Gordon Johnson in a note. Tesla’s competitors in this arena are Alphabet, Inc.’s GOOGL GOOG Waymo and General Motors Corp.’s GM Cruise.



With Tesla eyeing the rollout of its Fully Supervised FSD in China, the Elon Musk-led company would be up against domestic player Baidu, Inc.’s BIDU Apollo Go.



Johnson referenced reviews by two sources to make his case. Independent lab AMCI Testing, which tried the technology, said the overall performance of Tesla’s camera-enabled autonomous-driving software is “suspect.” In a report released on Tuesday, the firm said its evaluation showed how often human intervention was required for safe operation. “In fact, our drivers had to intervene over 75 times during the evaluation; an average of once every 13 miles,” it said.



While the FSD 12.5.1 was impressive, it is incredibly dangerous for drivers operating with FSD to drive with their hands in their laps or away from the steering wheels, it said. “The most critical moments of FSD miscalculation are split-second events that even professional drivers, operating with a test mindset, must focus on catching,” it added.



Johnson also referred to data from [Teslafsdtracker.com](http://Teslafsdtracker.com), which aggregates TSLA FSD driving experiences/data, in real-time from users, which shows that the latest iteration of FSD has a **critical disengagement every 130 miles and every 72 miles when driven in a city.**

  
Data reported by competitors to the California Department of Motor Vehicles show that miles to disengagement data for various players are as follows:

* Waymo: 17,311 miles
* **Amazon, Inc.’s** AMZN Zoox: 177,602 miles
* [Pony.Ai](http://Pony.Ai) (startup): 17,077 miles
* WeRide (startup): 21,191 miles

The **metric for Tesla is 13 miles**, based on AMCI’s statistics, Johnson said, although Tesla doesn’t yet report data to California DMV, given its FSD tech is **only Level 2.**  


**Why It’s Important:** Johnson noted that many sell-side analysts assign a valuation of $300 billion to $600 billion for Tesla’s FSD technology. In real-time, the value is close to zero, he said, adding that it could be negative, given the “liability of putting something this dangerous on roads.”

  
According to Ark’s valuation model, by 2029, robotaxis, which has FSD as its core technology, would account for 63% of Tesla’s revenue and 86% of EBITDA.

Future Fund LLC Managing Partner Gary Black, a Tesla bull, said in a recent post on X that Tesla's FSD is not yet close to the 99.99% efficacy needed for unsupervised autonomy.



In premarket trading on Thursday, Tesla rose 2.05% to $262.30

2024-09-04 13:08:35,r/stocks,Why are people opposed to antitrust probes or merger blocks?,"Antitrust courts and merger blocks are necessary for a competitive market to work for all economic actors in a capitalist system. There are countless economy studies about it and how it is actually better for all economic actors to not have monopolies, duopolies etc.  

Now reading comments on this sub, it seems like people are experts in this difficult domain of antitrust law and almost always side with the companies that potentially break the law. 

Why is that? Even if you have shares in that company, you will end up better by having a competitive market. I.e. we are all nvidia shareholders if you bought S&amp;P, but it would be better for other companies (and long-term for S&amp;P) to fight a monopoly if there is one and ensure that the rules are respected and nobody abuses a monopoly. 

To me this anti FTC, anti DOJ reaction is short sighted and hurts the long term interests of all shareholders, no matter what shares you bought.

30% of my portfolio is GOOG stock and I believe the DoJ case is the best thing that happens to them. A monopolist is lazy, ineficient, not innovating enough because they have their revenue secured. No matter the DoJ decision, it will be breaking the status quo and push GOOG to innovate and create more value for shareholders. The same thing for NVDA. Long term, the worst for them is to be a monopolist and maintain the status quo. Until they become Boeing.

TLDR: No matter what stock you bought, if you are in for the long term, it is in your interest for all the companies to play by the rules and have a competitive, anti-monopolistic, market.",174,73,PunchTornado,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1f8qi4h/why_are_people_opposed_to_antitrust_probes_or/,1f8qi4h
2024-08-22 15:49:37,r/stocks,How many stocks is too many? I hold 50 now.. Better just go for an index ETF?,"So over years, I've been gathering over 50 stocks. Of course, some have performed great, largely because my timing, mid-2022, was an excellent entry point. But of course, I can't help brag about my selection choice. For example, Qualcomm, AMD, JPM, MSFT, GOOG, Citi.

I (think), I hit most of the semiconductor names, except NVDA. For some reason, it never felt like a good investment. I have my skepticism about LLMs and Gen-AI hype. Besides, generating cat pics or idle plays with Chat-GPT, I haven't ***yet*** seen a business effectively using Gen-AI as a compelling competitive edge. So, please educate me here as well. AMD is different because of data center servers product line - which is more solid story.

Besides missing such obvious biggies, not all of what I touched has performed. I felt, European carmakers (BMW, VW, MBG) were deep value at PE 3-5 and 8-9% yields, but obviously I was wrong. They were cheap for a reason.

**Main question** - I was wondering if I can do a simulation of hypothetical scenario where I had simply invested in index, saving me enormous time in research. If so, please suggest tools/sites?

Note that the amounts and time of entry/exit are not constant, so I can't use the simple lumpsum or periodic investing calculators that assume regular constant amounts and intervals.

With 50 stocks in my portfolio, I wonder if it is just mirroring the index, or generating any real alpha. Obviously, when I buy something, I am highly convinced of my reasonings.

It's only up until very recently that I was made known that Gemini AI is entirely trained on Google custom TPU. I read a little about it (I found that TPU discussion is very little over here) and found that in the earlier days since Alexnet deep learning approach back to 2012.

Previous generalized computing (thank you Intel Xeon) tries to cope with big data workload. Accelerators were found to be particularly efficient in those machine learning workload. Early exploration by Google on designing custom TPU for themselves so they can have more flexibility catering to specific workloads. This decision alone turns out to be very valuable in today's Gen AI era.

With recent news from Apple that they have been training their AI models with Google's TPU, also the performance of Gemini AI to be on par with industry leading ChatGPT (heard that Antropic's Sonnet is even better - but Gemini is really good enough for my daily use).

These observations make strong statements to the Gen AI community, i.e.,  you can bypass Nvidia and still perform adequately well (even supercede for some reports) in your AI product offering.

The fact that Google does not hoard all its computing power to its own Gemini training, and the ability to extend its compute to customers like AAPL speak volume on the native TPU effectiveness.

Cost and time wise, Google is the prime candidate in AI era as TPU helps smoothen out the training cost. With ads revenue fueling the AI training (heard that OpenAI now needs more money), and superior TPU working natively, I'm of the opinion that Google will create a lot of value many years from now.",86,34,alex_godspeed,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1es01n4/goog_bull_case_custom_tpu_leading_to_successful/,1es01n4

I was doing some reflecting, looking at my portfolio that I have slowly been building since July / Aug of 2021. I have mostly been doing stock picking based on companies I liked, and unfortunately I have come to the realization that I have missed out on quite a bit of gains from not simply investing in VOO or SPY. My total return on three years of investing is 25% (although last week it peaked at 39%, which probably goes to show that I am over exposed), but had I just put my money in VOO in a dollar cost averaging method, I would likely have a much higher return.

Any advice for me? Should I just sell things off and put them in VOO? My current portfolio breakdown looks like this. Of course some bigger losers I have sold off. *$7934 invested, $9950 current.*

2024-08-01 20:13:46,r/stocks,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&amp;P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&amp;P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&amp;P 500 over the next 24 months.

I looked at Blackrock, and it seem to be doing fine. 6 bln income growing YoY, and 11bln in debt, which is ok. The company has a strong competitive position, over 11tn in assets under management, and an healthy PE of 20. I think that growth is likely to continue, (rising valuations, launch on new blackrock ETFs, service expansion) and their position is too dominant to be disrupted. I am not sure of their pricing power though, their ETFs clients are very sensitive, but at that scale they should fund a way to monetize (revenue is around 0.17% of their AUM).

I’m going to say the trend is our friend here and assume that by, even 2025 that we’ll see gains above this strike price. 

Also another question, I know the value of a call option goes down the closer to the expiry date it gets, is that only the upfront cost that you paid for the contracts that goes down or is it the actual profit made from the shares or is it both?

So searched about this I found that it was due to ""stock split"". From what I understood about this, is basically increasing the number of available stocks but keeping the proportion of what the company is worth. Meaning if before I had 10 stocks at 500, now I'll have 20 stocks at 250. I get that part, but I couldn't figure why this is done, what does the company gains by doing this.

","*Consumers will soon have access to* [*yet another streaming bundle*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-streaming-wars-are-over-morning-brief-100018167.html)*. Comcast (*[*CMCSA*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CMCSA)*) CEO Brian Roberts said early Tuesday that later this month, the company will launch a new offering that combines its Peacock platform, Netflix (*[*NFLX*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/?fr=sycsrp_catchall)*), and Apple TV+ (*[*AAPL*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/?fr=sycsrp_catchall)*).*

*The new bundle, referred to as StreamSaver, will be available to customers of Comcast’s broadband internet service, the executive revealed at a MoffettNathanson conference.*

*""Those three products will come at a vastly reduced price to anything in the market today and be available to all our customers,"" Roberts said. Exact pricing details will be announced at a later date.*

*""We've been bundling video successfully and creatively for 60 years,"" he added. ""This is the latest iteration of that, and I think this will be a pretty compelling package.""*

*The developments come as media companies face pressure from investors to scale their streaming services and achieve profitability.

That means fewer opportunities for streamers to retain loyal subscribers over time.*

*The concept of bundling isn't new. Companies in the space have been doing it with their own services for years. Apple, for instance, offers Apple One, which combines Apple TV+ with other services like Apple Music and Apple Arcade. The bundle launched globally in late 2020.*

&gt;A landmark antitrust case pitting Google (GOOG, GOOGL) against the Justice Department entered its final stage this past week as prosecutors from the federal government and 14 states said in their closing arguments that Google illegally monopolized the online search and search advertising markets.

&gt;A government win would certainly threaten a giant piece of Google’s $237.8 billion profit engine. But the outcome, which will be decided by US District Judge Amit Mehta in the weeks or months to come, also has giant implications for some of the other big names in the tech world.

&gt;That's because Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims, and because all three stand to lose or gain depending on the outcome.

&gt;The government argues Google is violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act by blocking competitors from entering three distinct markets: general online search, search advertising, and search text advertising.

&gt;A government win would put at risk the billions of dollars in mutually lucrative contracts between Google and Apple, as well as deals with other device manufacturers and telecom companies.

&gt; The government alleged in its case that Google pays billions of dollars each year to LG, Motorola (MSI), and Samsung; major US wireless carriers such as AT&amp;T (T), T-Mobile (TMUS), and Verizon (VZ); and browser developers such as Mozilla, Opera, and UCWeb.

&gt;Government prosecutors have alleged that Google had been paying Apple an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion per year — a portion of search ad revenue — in exchange for awarding Google Search default placement on Apple devices.

&gt;The government has yet to say what precise remedy it desires should it prevail against Google. If the government does win on any of its claims, a separate remedies phase of the trial would be held.",524,52,TheYoungLung,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ckv9wx/the_ending_of_googles_monopoly_trial_has_silicon/,1ckv9wx

2024-04-01 18:35:39,r/stocks,“Go woke go broke” contrarian strategy ,"Note: this is not meant to be a post about politics whatsoever, I’m just describing how certain companies seem to be perceived online, and the effect it has on their stock prices. 


I’m sure you are all familiar with the idea of investing in the opposite of whatever you see on investing (or gambling) subreddits. (maybe you remember the multitude of highly upvoted “why should I ever buy SPY over ARKK?” posts in 2020 and 2021)


A promising strategy seems to be going long on a stock whenever it is at a local price low due to receiving a shitstorm for being “too woke” by loud online communities. Examples I can think of. 


Disney $DIS: derided as being “too woke” for a long time. Picking the release of Little Mermaid as the recent height of the discourse, the stock was at 90 on May 26, 2023. Since then it is up 37.6%, outperforming the S&amp;P’s 24.4% gain. 


Target $TGT: New York Post wrote an article about them being too woke on August 17, 2023. Since then Target is up 37.6% compared to 19.6% for the index. 


Google $GOOG: faced a “woke” backlash due to their AI at the end of February. Since then, the stock is up 12.5% compared to 1.5% for the Nasdaq. 


What do you think about going long companies that have a dip in share price based on conservative backlash? Companies currently facing backlash for being too woke:

Nike $NKE for putting a purple St Georges Cross on their apparel

Tyson Foods $TSN for supposedly wanting to hire asylum seekers for their factories (although Tyson has denied this outright) 

Starbucks $SBUX for perceived hiring discrimination/DEI hiring policies. Interestingly Starbucks is also facing extremely vocal boycott calls from pro-Palestinian groups online, despite having no stores in Israel or any connection to the country whatsoever. I’m watching this one closely since all their financial metrics seem very good but the stock hasn’t done too well, potentially because of the bad publicity from both sides.

2024-03-14 13:56:52,r/stocks,Tesla (TSLA) DCF Analysis,"***NOTE: NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE***

# Introduction:

TSLA is the world's most renowned Electric Vehicle(EV) automaker, catalyzing the world's acceleration towards Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) Vehicles. TSLA has become the gold standard for what a high-quality EV stands for, all thanks in part to their founder's vision and belief in renewable energy especially during the tumultuous early years of TSLA. TSLA no longer just stands for EV but renewable energy, having branched out into Energy Storage, and Solar Panels.  TSLA hopes to create an ecosystem for renewable energy from charging to energy storage to the vehicle used, all this tied together by dedicated software created by TSLA at every point of contact in the ecosystem. This ecosystem business model has seen massive success as evident from businesses like GOOG, AAPL, and MSFT. I believe the next frontier of growth for TSLA comes from energy storage rather than automotive, however automotive will still account for the largest chunk of revenue for TSLA.

# Market:

TSLA's closest EV competitor is BYD. TSLA has won BYD on almost every front. A country where BYD has managed to wrest control from TSLA is Thailand. So I'll analyze this market specifically to rationalize why I believe this victory will be shortlived.

In Thailand, the top 3 most popular car models are BYD Atto 3, Netta V, and BYD Dolphin ([SOURCE](https://carnewschina.com/2024/01/09/byd-is-bestselling-ev-brand-in-thailand-in-2023-neta-is-runner-up/)).   

|Model|Price|Range|
|:-|:-|:-|
|BYD Atto 3|1.1M Baht|521 km/charge|
|Neta V|0.55M Baht|380 km/charge|
|BYD Dolphin|0.75M Baht|427 km/charge|
|Tesla Model 3|1.59M Baht|513 km/charge|

In Thailand, 60.17% of the population owns a car ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1027960/thailand-car-ownership-among-consumers/)) with the average car price being about 0.78M Baht. This means that a Tesla Model 3, TSLA's cheapest model is double the average price of a normal car in Thailand. 

[SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1030220/thailand-average-monthly-income-per-household-by-region/)) which means that the Tesla Model 3 is a luxury good rather than an affordable commodity for the average household. The difference in price between BYD and Tesla is a full year's worth of income for the average household which leads the price-conscious consumers in Thailand to naturally gravitate towards BYD, hence the popularity of BYD over Tesla in Thailand.   
  
Ultimately, I do believe that if TSLA continues competing on quality and finds ways to cut costs such as directly setting up factories in Thailand ([SOURCE](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/05/business/thailand-tesla-factory-talks-intl-hnk/index.html)), it will be able to close the price gap with BYD. As ""people are really stretching their wallets to be able to afford a Tesla. It’s quite a difficult thing for them to do, and remarkable that it’s the best-selling car in unit volume, despite being much more expensive than other high-volume cars.” - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference

# Revenue:

TSLA has 5 revenue channels, namely “Automotive Sales”, “Services and Others”, “Automotive Lease”, “Automotive Regulatory Credit” and “Energy Generation and Storage sales”. 

***Automotive Sales***

Automotive sales refers to the direct sale of TSLA’s vehicles fully paid upfront.

Elon Musk believes that manufacturing capabilities will be the most important C.A. for TSLA. “perhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in the future will be manufacturing technology” -  2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. 

When forecasting the Number of Vehicles each Gigafactory can produce, I took into account that Elon Musk recently unveiled in the 2023 Q4 Earnings conference that there is a new revolutionary manufacturing technology that is expected to drastically improve production. He hopes to pilot test this technology at the Texas Gigafactory to produce their low-cost EV before proceeding to replicate the technology in every Gigafactory. “the sensible way to go about things is kind of figure out the core technology of the manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world.” -  2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. So, in my first 3 years, I assume that the growth rate is below historical averages as TSLA tests out new technology in preparation for the launch of the low-cost EV. I assumed that TSLA’s manufacturing technology was successful.  
  
When forecasting %Vehicles delivered, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historical averages  
  
When forecasting Avg Price/Vehicles Delivered, Elon Musk doesn’t believe in price increases to increase the topline. As evident in 2021 and 2022 where Elon Musk only increased prices due to supply chain constraints before bringing prices back down in 2023. In China, Elon Musk ended up cutting prices due to being able to source significantly cheaper batteries there. I assumed that over time as TSLA enjoys sufficient economies of scale, they will only increase prices in line with perpetual inflation.  


***Services and Others***

TSLA provides a few services such as home servicing in certain regions or customers pay to access TSLA’s network of SuperChargers.  
  
Lifetime number of TSLA automobile (Ex roadster) delivered ([SOURCE](https://backlinko.com/tesla-stats))

Assuming that TSLA is properly maintained they can last \~20 years ([SOURCE](https://caredge.com/blog/how-long-tesla-batteries-last)). Opting for less granularity, in my forecast I assumed the total lifetime number of tesla cars remained constant without any churn.

When forecasting Services and Others, Opting for less granularity I assumed that the servicing’s pricing grew following the price of the vehicle in line with historic averages. 

  
***Automotive Lease***

TSLA has 2 types of lease, “Direct Vehicle Operations Lease” which leases out vehicles to customers for up to 48 months afterwards the vehicle is returned to TSLA. “Direct Sales Lease” either granting the customer title of the vehicle once full payment has been made or the customer has the option of refusing the vehicle.  
  
When forecasting Automotive leasing, as prices for TSLA fell in 2023, Automotive leasing as a percentage of Automotive Sales dropped as it is now cheaper for customers to purchase their tesla in 1 lump sum payment. I assumed that following this trend, as TSLA’s affordability increases over time the %Automotive Sales decreases as well before remaining constant in perpetuity.

  
***Automotive Regulatory Credit***

TSLA has excess carbon credit which it sells to competitors.

“It will continue for some period of time, but eventually this stream of regulatory credits will reduce.” ([SOURCE](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-9-billion-revenue-selling-regulatory-credits-to-other-carmakers-2024-2)).  


When forecasting Automotive Regulatory Credit, given that TSLA does not intend to depend on these credits for revenue, I assume that as a %of Automotive sales, credit will contribute to a significantly lesser amount in perpetuity. This is further exacerbated by other automobile companies accelerating their push towards EVs as countries begin phasing out ICE vehicles. So, more companies begin having excess regulatory credits as well. Ultimately, I believe that leading up to 2030 the amount of revenue contributed by Regulatory credits decreases to a significant level. 

  
***Energy Generation and Storage Sales***

TSLA produces Energy Storage systems e.g. Megapack and Solar Energy related products e.g. Solar Panels which it directly sells to customers.  
  
For energy storage more specifically megapacks, as the world phases out ICE vehicles and begins embracing renewable energy, it leads to a surge in demand for electricity. However, the issue with renewable energy is that “The most common renewable energy sources like the sun and wind are intermittent or have lower baseload capabilities than coal, natural gas, or nuclear sources. This makes it necessary to have a way to conserve excess energy produced during peak hours. This extra energy can then be supplied through the grid or otherwise when the sun is down, or wind speed reduces.” ([SOURCE](https://www.batterycycle.io/why-is-tesla-focusing-on-the-battery-energy-storage-market/)). As an example to elaborate on how much importance is placed on energy storage, China mandates that all renewable energy facilities must store at least 20% of their total output ([SOURCE](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiYquPrkuaEAxXuSGwGHffzBkgQFnoECA0QAw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Ferikkobayashisolomon%2F2023%2F12%2F20%2Fenergy-vault-wins-big-with-gravity-storage-in-china%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DChina%2520has%2520mandated%2520that%2520all%2Cgeneration%2520capacity%27s%2520worth%2520of%2520storage.&amp;usg=AOvVaw3WMq0w9-2ka0Cz2kAGbCWX&amp;opi=89978449)).  
  
The closest competitor to TSLA in energy pack is BYD. The TSLA’s megapack is smaller in dimensions compared to BYD and on top of that TSLA has built its own software to be compatible with the megapack hardware with features such as Autobidder (Software to optimize energy trading) and Powerhub.  
  
Right now what's stopping revenue for energy storage is production capacity, TSLA opened its megapack factory in Lathrop to curb this. TSLA has also announced its plans to build a megapack factory in China to assist with production capacity ([SOURCE](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-22/tesla-acquires-land-for-shanghai-megapack-battery-factory)). As an overarching goal for my forecast, I took into account the TSLA master plan 3.  
  
When forecasting number of dedicated megapack factories opened, I assumed that TSLA would open 1 additional plant every 3 years for the next 10 years, to meet the large surge in demand as countries accelerate their push towards renewable energy.  
  
When forecasting Max Output/Factory, taking into account this article on expected output. ([SOURCE](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2023/11/tesla-megapack-factory-production-limit-solved-and-capacity-will-be-doubled-to-80-gwh.html)). TSLA’s Lathrop Megapack factory can produce 80GWh/Year in part due to them doubling their existing lines and resolving certain issues. Over time I believe that TSLA can massively increase the Max Output/Factory, as TSLA consistently touts their innovations as having an S curve of progression, where progress is slower at the earlier stages before exponentially increasing.   
As a sanity check, in my base case assuming that all Mega packs are still at 4 MWh. TSLA has to produce 406,200 Mega Packs or 81,240 Mega Pack per factory a year by 2038. As of November 2023, the Lathrop factory can produce 20,000 megapack. So, in 15 years I believe it is a reasonable amount of time necessary for TSLA to ramp up their production 4x.  
  
When forecasting %GWh Deployed, I had to assume total output which is a function of max output and the number of gigafatories. I assumed that over the years as more countries begin phasing out ICE vehicles in favor of EVs, there is a larger need to deploy more energy storage so this % increases to a large extent.  
  
When forecasting Avg Sales/GWh Deployed, Elon Musk does not like to increase sales through increasing pricing which was why when TSLA enjoyed economies of scale from increasing output in their Lathrop factory the Avg Sales/GWh Deployed decreased. So, applying this principle of TSLA slashing prices when costs decrease due to economies of scale, I assumed that TSLA continued slashing prices before increasing by the perpetual inflation rate.

# Cost:

“predicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this equation, some of which are out of our control like the change in tariffs or local incentives to name a few. While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approaching the limits within our current platforms.” - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. 

  
When forecasting Automotive and Non-Automtoive COGS, COGS as a %revenue for 2021 and 2022 are likely to be lower due to TSLA pre-emptively increasing sales price to deal with inflation. However, in 2023 COGS as a %revenue increased as TSLA cut back on sales price. Going forward, I’ll assume that TSLA tends towards historic pre-covid average. However, in the long run, as TSLA successfully implements their manufacturing technology this % will decrease even further.  
When forecasting R&amp;D, SG&amp;A, and Others, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.

# WACC:

US 10Y T-Bond (1M Avg) = 4.12%  
Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/)) = 2.41  
Stable Market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%  
COE = 15.21%  
   
TSLA is rated at BAA3 ([SOURCE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DBAA))  
COD (1M Avg) = 5.72%  
Marginal Tax Rate = 21.00%  
AT-COD = 4.52%  
  
Market Price (5D Avg) = $178.50  
Shares O/S = 3184.79M

Market Value of Debt = 4578.78M  
%Debt = 0.80%  
%Equity = 99.20%  
WACC = 15.12%  
  
Currently, TSLA has a very large beta as its stock has increased in volatility in the past few years. However, I believe that this volatility will not persist for very long as most big tech stocks enter a stable stage where their beta tends downwards. So, as a proxy for how low TSLA’s beta will tend to, I looked at other big tech stocks.



|Name|Beta|
|:-|:-|
|Google (GOOG)|1.04|
|Microsoft (MSFT)|0.89|
|Meta (META)|1.21|

Taking the average beta, we arrive at a beta of 1.05. Assuming similar D/E composition and bond rating. I assumed that it took another 10 years for TSLA to reach the stable state.  
  
Stable State COE = 8.95%  
Stable State AT-COD = 4.52%  
TSLA’s stable stage WACC = 8.90%  


# Conclusion:

Ultimately in my base case, I value TSLA at $186.88 per share. I believe that there is still room for TSLA to grow, having such a strong first movers advantage in the renewable energy market means that TSLA is heads and shoulders above its competitors. I believe that the market is undervaluing the Energy Storage arm of TSLA's business, and less emphasis is placed on this potentially disruptive segment of business.

Lot of people kicking themselves for not see this coming, or someone like me who saw it coming but exited earlier because couldn’t value the “shovel” correctly in this gold rush.   
Now lets take a step back and look at this trend from a different angle. Main buyers are the big 5 Google, OpenAI, META, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT (GOMAM).  
In order for your you all to understand my next points we all first have to agree on few basic things  
**1). Companies have FINITE capex amount**  
**2). Every company at the end of the day WANTS to make money**  
**3). Every company wants to find a way to REDUCE their capex and still grow**  
For point #2, the way these company will eventually make money is by selling the products to consumer and business. So in next 5-10 years we will see leap in software and services innovations. We will see so many new small and midsize companies using these applications to build more complex solutions on cloud. Now take your guess who will benefit the most from this? if your answer is GOMAM, thats correct. If your answer is NVDA then you are an idiot.   
I would say point #1 and point #3 go hand in hand, we are seeing lot of capex diverted within the company itself. So to no surprise, GOMAM are already building and some have built their own silicon. Its just matter of time when they start to reduce their exposure to external company. This isn’t to say that NVDA will ever become irrelevant. The point is they will always have to outgrow and justify for GOMAM to spend their capex on them. This is the bet you are making for going LONG nvidia at these valuation. Because again, market is short sighted, they are seeing 6-12 month guidance and pumping.  
Now i am seeing crazy amount of doom and gloom for companies like AAPL and GOOG lately on reddit and also on media. I just have one question, that goes to #2. How do you guys think every software and services that will leverage these new silicon will reach the end users? Think for a second form a consumer standpoint. They don’t know wtf is NVDA, AMD. All they know is smartphones, tablets, wearable, laptops. I am not saying where you should invest your money. I am just saying don’t go with the trend like a madman. if you miss the shovel rush, you can still make plenty of money on factories that will make gold products for end users.   
**in summary,**   
**I see there is more value in going long on GOMAAM (Added AAPL) than NVDA,AMD**",120,26,daynightcase,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b74mw7/ai_madness_and_profitablity/,1b74mw7

2024-02-15 13:25:08,r/stocks,Google (GOOG) DCF Analysis,"**NOTE NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**

# Introduction:

GOOG has a very simplistic goal in their business, yet this simple goal managed to carry GOOG's market cap to a trillion dollar. GOOG's main business model is centered around helping consumers sieve through large chunks of data to find what they need or want to find. Recently, with the announcement of Gemini, GOOG's GenAI, it led to a temporary spike in stock prices as investors believed that Gemini would be able to compete with ChatGPT. I believe that the advancement of GenAI is necessary for GOOG given how reliant they are on Search revenue.

# Revenue:

The success of GOOG’s advertising is hinged on 2 criteria, being able to attract and retain users and being able to monetize advertisers.

***For attracting and retaining users,***

1. GOOG released Gemini their generative AI to help complement Search. This allows users to process information faster or seek answers more efficiently.
2. GOOG has entered into a deal with AAPL to make Google the default search engine on Safari. This deal is estimated to be worth about 18 billion per year.
3. There is a large switching cost for long-term users to switch over to a rival search engine. This is so because using the Google search engine means that there is a high chance users will be indoctrinated into the GOOG ecosystem (E.g. Gmail, Google Drive, etc.).

***For monetizing advertisers,***

1. GOOG is one of the largest platforms that advertisers can advertise on. The type of information that users receive is dependent on GOOG, GOOG controls the information flow to consumers and hence is a powerful platform for advertisers to advertise on.

Apart from these factors, GOOG has begun targeting SMBs (Small and Midsize Businesses).

How GOOG sees SMBs (Small, Medium Businesses) advertising with them is that GOOG will provide Gen AI to generate images/captions for their ad campaign then SMBs use these advertising materials and advertise on Search.

When forecasting advertising revenue, opting for less granularity, and due to a lack of public data, I lumped both search and YouTube together. Taking the number of YouTube users as a proxy for the popularity of GOOG’s advertising tools.

So, I assumed that it would take 1 year for GOOG to finish and get Gemini up to speed. I assumed that it takes about 2 years for consumers to get used to Gemini and for advertisers to notice this shift. This quick adaptation is because ChatGPT took off very quickly within the year it was released.

When forecasting revenue/users, due to the macro constraints and pessimism advertisers are cautious about advertising so the revenue/users have been dropping for the past 2 years. I assume it takes 2 years for the macro outlook to improve and during the high growth period, revenue/users grow as well as more advertisers start spending more.

&amp;#x200B;

When forecasting Google Subscriptions + Others, which entails YouTube premium, GOOG devices, and Google Play revenue. I assumed that the success of this category is based on YouTube Premium so I forecasted this revenue segment based on the number of subscribers to YouTube Premium. Number of Subscribers in 2022 ([SOURCE](https://www.billboard.com/business/streaming/youtube-music-premium-subscribers-how-many-1235594920/#:~:text=That's%20up%20from%20the%2080,at%20the%20end%20of%202021)). Comparing Youtube Music to its strongest competitor Spotify, Spotify has a large switching cost due to years worth of playlists built that would be lost by switching over. On top of that, having to learn the new UI of YouTube Music and the lack of certain features that Spotify users are used to.So, the main driver for this segment would be YouTube Premium, given the indispensable nature of YouTube due to the strong network effect and new frontiers such as YouTube Shorts that are driving people to YouTube, and the longer unskippable ads, all these factors are driving people to subscribe to YouTube Premium. However, I’m cautious about how much or how fast YouTube Premium will grow. Due to strong competitors such as TikTok and Spotify, I’d assume the historic large growth will taper downwards as the high historic growth was due to the low-hanging fruits being picked.

&amp;#x200B;

When forecasting Revenue/Users, as GOOG wants to keep their prices low to attract users to YouTube Premium, historically the revenue/users have been declining. However, as recently as July 2023 GOOG started hiking prices. So, I’d assume that in my forecast from FY24 onwards, the Revenue/Users begin rising.  Historic price hikes have been at around 16%, I’d assume that GOOG no longer pursues such aggressive price rises and begins tapering down their price increases. Their perpetual Revenue/users growing in line with the perpetual inflation rate.

&amp;#x200B;

When forecasting Google Cloud revenue, since there isn’t available relevant data to create a bottoms-up revenue model I forecasted it as Y/Y growth. Taking into account ([SOURCE](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/cloud-computing-industry)). Given that GOOG mainly offers IAAS and SAAS for cloud computing, as businesses begin ramping up their digital efforts in line with the global push towards digitalization there is an increasing demand for IAAS and SAAS cloud computing, especially for IAAS which is stated to have the highest growth rate. I assumed that GOOG’s cloud revenue grew at a Y/Y CAGR of 19.3%.

# Cost:

When forecasting COGS, TAC accounted for about 40% of COGS as per 2023 10-K. I assumed that TAC would tend slightly upwards due to the competition for traffic increasing from competitors such as TikTok.

When forecasting R&amp;D and marketing, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.

When forecasting G&amp;A, management has stated that there is a potential usage of AI to reduce the need for labor. I’d assume that G&amp;A tends downward slightly.

# WACC:

RFR (1M Avg) = 4.14%

Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/)) = 1.06

Stable market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%

COE = 9.02%

# 

Conclusion:

Ultimately, in my base case, I value GOOG at $143.16 per share. I believe that GOOG is a company with strong growth potential. However, given that GOOG is a household name and especially with the recent hype when they announced gemini it has led to a lot of enthusiasm and bullish outlook that caused their prices to temporarily spike upwards.

2024-02-10 22:37:29,r/stocks,"Alphabet (GOOG) $150, Looks like an excellent long term Buy for 3-5 Years","**Alphabet reported excellent results for Q4-2023**  
Overall top line revenue of $86.1Bn grew 13% - third quarter of revenue growth after dipping in 2022. 

**Cloud roared back to 26% growth at $9.19Bn after a muted Q3** \- that should dispel any notion that Google Cloud can’t compete with Azure or AWS, or simply doesn’t have the AI tools. It implies that Google Cloud is just crossing above a $36 billion annual run rate. Margins improved - operating margin in Q4 came in at 9% compared to 3% in the previous quarter and (0.2%) in Q4 last year.  
Google Cloud is continuing to close this growth rate gap with Azure, and may surpass Azure leveraging AI. Like AWS and Azure, Google Cloud is seeing strong momentum with AI products, which is helping it win and upsell deals. Management said that the “strong demand we are seeing for our vertically integrated AI portfolio is creating new opportunities for Google Cloud across every product area,”  
CEO Sundar Pichai said that “greater than 70% of gen AI unicorns are using Google Cloud,” and customers including Anthropic and Mistral AI are building and serving LLMs on Google Cloud’s AI Hypercomputer, which combines Google’s “TPUs and GPUs, AI software and Multislice and Multi-host technology to provide performance and cost advantages for training and serving models.”  
**Is Alphabet monetizing AI? Yes**  
1. Google Cloud is charging $30/month via subscriptions with Duet AI and management noted that customers are “increasingly choosing Duet AI” to “boost productivity and improve their operations.” This is a competing product with GPT 4 - Duet AI will incorporate Google’s Gemini, its multi-modal family of LLMs developed to challenge OpenAI’s GPT-4. Google Cloud ""is intensely focused on bringing the benefits of Gemini” to its cloud customers, and the rollout of the top iteration,  
2. Gemini Ultra, at a $20/month subscription could help Google gain share away from OpenAI and thus Azure while increasing revenue.  
You Tube, which grew at 16% was also slightly better than expected at $9.2Bn  
**Net Profit jumped 52% to $20.69 billion, or $1.64 per share, (This was in spite of $1.2Bn severance charges)**  
Subscriptions are a $15Bn business now, led mostly by You Tube.  
**Alphabet is an extremely profitable company, it has an operating profit margin of 27%! — that too after all the massive spending on other bets such as Waymo, CAPEX on Al, etc.**  
Alphabet’s earnings should double in the next 4 years to about $10.50 - an 18% growth.  
I believe it is definitely worth buying at a P/E of 21. The Price to Earnings Growth ratio (PEG)  is just 1.17   - that’s nothing for a market leader, $342Bn behemoth, with a search engine monopoly, and a very strong presence in AI and Cloud.",905,181,Fountainheadusa,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1anr3id/alphabet_goog_150_looks_like_an_excellent_long/,1anr3id

For those who don't know the Magnificent 7 are: **AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, META, TSLA, NVDA.** With a combined market cap of **more than $11 trillion**, they currently make up approx. **29% of the S&amp;P 500's market cap.** 

The 7 giants have gained **71%** so far this year while the rest of the 493 stocks included in the benchmark index have gained 6%. They have also outperformed all other stocks in terms of growth, profit margins and forward EPS growth, and have stronger balance sheets. 

Most analysts expect that the M7 will continue to outperform all other companies until 2025 at least. 

Now I know this is a ""stocks"" subreddit but just like the majority of retail investors, a large chunk of my portfolio is alocated to an S&amp;P 500 ETF.

Should we expect these 7 to continue outperforming the rest of the world? Should we consider cyclicality?

Specifically, I'm caught between rebalancing my current tech-heavy portfolio, adding AAPL to the mix, or just simplifying life by moving everything into QQQ.

AMZN: \~9%  
NVDA: \~8%  
TSLA: \~6%

Some Context:  
I earned my MSFT shares during my career there and am pretty bullish on their future, hence the big slice of the pie they occupy. I added the TSLA in 2016 and sold a few when it had a big gain but again I'm bullish on them. Most of the stocks have been held for at least 3 years.  
  
So, what are your thoughts?  
  
Should I rebalance these existing stocks?  
Should I consider adding AAPL to diversify a bit within the tech sector?  
Or should I just move it all into QQQ for ease of management?

  
Just seeking opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

If I don't simplify now I will need to in the coming years. I have a couple of years of cash equivalents available and will rebalance annually.

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.
[Money doesn't grow on trees]

But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears — that the rally had become too concentrated — has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) logging gains between June and July.

And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.

This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.

Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notably, however, Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years.

[**Broadening of the market.**](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Cj8RJI9cSQHXtbHDpHlEqQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/134ad610-2fe2-11ee-bf6f-1ffefac75b64)

In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.

The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.

And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)

Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.

In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.

Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).

And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.

The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.

Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart — up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.

3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).

Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.

Consumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%.

2023-07-10 22:25:37,r/stocks,"Nasdaq 100 Plans Special Rebalance To Curb Dominance Of 'Magnificent Seven' (apple, meta, google, Microsoft, Tesla..)","From https://www.investors.com/news/nasdaq-100-plans-special-rebalance-to-curb-dominance-of-magnificent-seven/



The Nasdaq 100 index is set to adjust the weighting of its 100 components, with the ""magnificent seven"" stocks Microsoft (MSFT), Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN) currently accounting for more than half the index's weight.

The magnificent seven stocks largely fell Monday.

The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will take place before the market open on Monday, July 24, to ""address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights.""

The weighting changes will be announced on Friday, July 14. No stocks will be added or removed.

The Nasdaq 100 includes the 100 largest non-financial Nasdaq components.


How Is the Nasdaq 100 Weighted?
The Nasdaq 100 index is a modified market-capitalization index. Market valuation is the largest factor, but with methodology to limit overconcentration.

The seven-largest companies in the Nasdaq 100 account for 55% of the index. It seems likely that this combined weighting will be reduced. It's also likely that there may be notable weighting shifts within these seven giants.

The current weights show that market capitalization is the dominant factor, but it's not the only one.

Microsoft stock has the largest weight, at 12.9%, as of July 7. Apple stock has a 12.5% weight, despite having a $2.999 trillion market cap vs. Microsoft's $2.51 trillion.

Google stock has a 7.4% weighting with the GOOGL and GOOG share classes combined.

Nvidia stock has vaulted to a 7% Nasdaq 100 weighting, thanks to its $1.05 trillion market cap. That's a slightly larger weight than Amazon stock (6.9%), even though the latter has a significantly higher valuation at $1.33 trillion.

Tesla stock and Meta Platforms round out the top-seven members, with weights of 4.5% and 4.3%, respectively.

Just for reference, for the entire Nasdaq composite, Apple stock had an 11.4% weighting as of July 7 while Microsoft was at 9.5%. GOOGL stock is at 5.8% while Amazon and Nvidia are at 5.1% and 4%, respectively. TSLA stock has 3.3% share and META stock is at 2.8%.

How Much Will Nasdaq 100 Megacaps Be Cut?
Based on Nasdaq 100 methodology, the combined weight of the five companies with the largest market caps will be set to 38.5%. The five-largest companies, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia had a combined weight of 46.7%. That suggests some notable reduced weightings for these names.

Meanwhile, no component outside the top-five market cap companies can have a Nasdaq 100 exceeding the lesser of 4.4% or the weight of the stock with the fifth-largest market valuation. That points to at least a slight decline in TSLA stock's weight.

The official reweightings should be released on Friday, perhaps after the close. That will also include stocks that will see increased weightings.

Magnificent Seven Soar In 2023
The Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), which tracks the big-cap Nasdaq index, was up 37.5% in 2023 through July 7. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW), which gives an equal weight to all 100 stocks, is up just 18.8%.

This largely reflects massive moves by megacaps this year. NVDA stock has nearly tripled (191%). META stock has soared 141% while TSLA stock is up 123%. AMZN stock has leapt 54.5%. AAPL stock has run up 47% and MSFT stock nearly 41%. Google stock is up a still-robust 35%.

There is some concern that this handful of names is distorting the health of the overall stock market, which is likely what's spurring the special rebalancing.

Will Nasdaq 100 Special Rebalance Affect Stock Prices?
The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will spur stock allocation shifts among ETFs such as QQQ and mutual funds that track the index. So there could be some one-off gains or losses, perhaps as the planned changes are announced on July 14.

However, the impacts may be modest. For one, the big-cap Nasdaq index is going to adjust weightings, vs. a full addition or deletion. Also, far more money tracks the S&amp;P 500, which is why S&amp;P 500 component changes get a lot more attention than Nasdaq 100 moves.

The S&amp;P 500 index, unlike the Nasdaq 100, is a pure market-cap weighted index.

Most of the ""magnificent 7"" stocks retreated Monday. Nvidia stock fell just 0.8%, while Apple slipped 1.1%. more than 1% intraday. Microsoft stock retreated 1.6%, TSLA 1.8% and Amazon 2%. GOOGL stock sank 2.5%.

The one exception: META stock climbed 1.2%, as Meta's new Threads app topped 100 million sign-ups in less than a week.

Megacaps weighed on the Nasdaq 100, which fell intraday before eked out a gain. The equal-weight QQEW jumped 1.8%.",126,22,Big_Forever5759,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14w58g3/nasdaq_100_plans_special_rebalance_to_curb/,14w58g3
2023-07-04 20:57:31,r/stocks,What is your process for discovering/reviewing stocks?,"I've been trading for a couple of years and lately I've been doing very well by paying attention to relationships and divergences among stocks/ETFs/commodities. Trying to understand and exploit the ebb and flow among sectors. Attempting to identify where long-term accumulation is taking place. First and foremost I watch SPY/QQQ/IWM, ES/NQ/RTY, VIX/VX, DXY/USD, and the 10Y. I also watch the SPDR Sector Funds like XLK, XLF, XLV, XLU, XLY, XLE, XLP, XBI, etc. Additionally, IWC (micro-caps) and IJH (mid-caps). 

And VTI (whole stock market ETF) and VT (whole world market ETF) I watch on the weekly chart to get a sense for where the world markets are trending in general. I haven't branched into other markets much, mainly focused on identifying 

1) where the current strength in the market is 

2) whether the market is remaining orderly/non-volatile 

3) how much divergence is taking place among sectors/stocks (e.g. last year felt like indiscriminate selling, this year the divergences are tremendous)

For individual stocks, I basically rifle through stocks with setups that interest me and I really lack organization for what I have on my charts during a trading day. I use Thinkorswim and typically have about 20 charts up across 3 monitors. It's been a challenge to manage my screen real estate and I still change things up all the time, haven't found a solid methodology I guess for what I have pulled up. Undoubtedly what you have pulled up can effect what you trade, how you perceive the market throughout the day, etc. 

A lot of times I have AAPL, TSLA, GOOG, AMZN, up at all times. From there I have a mix of stocks from other sectors, maybe a couple wildcards like a small cap/squeeze name. But generally my goal is to display to myself options that I'm unlikely to be severely wrong on, or end up taking a big loss on. I go through and adjust what I'm looking to every night, but admittedly I do need more organization, journaling, and operating more systematically.  

So what is your process for evaluating the market? Discovering stocks and setups. What do you have open during the trading day? How many charts? Do you purposefully limit what you see? Do you use any websites/tools to organize your watchlist(s)? Give me your wisdoms",51,14,0ssu,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14qnqfd/what_is_your_process_for_discoveringreviewing/,14qnqfd

2023-06-21 08:45:44,r/stocks,4 Tech stocks benefiting from the AI boom.,"The world of artificial intelligence (AI) these days is overwhelmingly dominated by discussions on generative AI and its implications. Simply put, generative AI is a form of machine learning through which AI software can produce text, video, images, and more. Basically, generative AI can produce any form of content on the basis of prompts. This form of AI became more widespread and renowned after the launch of ChatGPT and similar generative AI platforms, which revolutionized the AI sector while pulling in major tech companies to become part of the AI race.  
  
This form of AI and its impact on the markets was discussed by Jim Stewart, a New York Times columnist, on CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' on June 16. According to Stewart, big tech companies, especially those that are AI beneficiaries, have been leading the recent stock market rally. These include companies such as Microsoft Corporation ($MSFT), Alphabet Inc. ($GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA). Stewart claimed that he was bullish on AI, especially considering the fact that this technology could boost productivity gains across different fields, including journalism.  
  
**AI and the US Stock Market**  
In May, NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA) joined the group of companies with valuations in trillions of dollars. Many financial professionals today are attributing the gains of the S&amp;P 500 to AI, primarily, with the focus being on NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA) and other big tech companies that have begun incorporating AI and generative AI in their products and services.  
  
This overwhelming focus on a select few number of companies that can successfully play the AI boom and come out victorious has led to many investors worrying that the stock market in 2023 will turn into a selection of a few winners and a lot more losers. The S&amp;P 500 has ""basically been the S&amp;P 7,"" a reference to the fact that only seven major tech companies have been calling the shots so far in 2023, leading the market to heavily rely on them and their gains.  
  
**""You Are At The Starting Line Of AI""**  
This reality has led many professionals and corporations to realize that the AI boom is very real and may be here to stay. Companies today will be bound to figure out where they stand in this environment and how they can integrate AI into their business models to reap the benefits of this technological revolution. NVIDIA Corporation's ($NVDA) CEO, Jensen Huang, in an address at the National Taiwan University in May, stated that we are currently at ""the starting line of AI"" and that at this moment, we should run instead of walking. The implications of his statement are many, but perhaps the most obvious lesson to take away from Huang's speech is that companies and individuals today shouldn't be slow to join the AI race - they should try their best to become part of it and ensure they don't end up getting left behind by their competitors.  
  
Keeping the above-mentioned market dynamics and developments in mind, I have compiled a list of the top tech stocks to consider investing in to play the AI boom. I included the obvious stock picks because of their contributions to this industry so far, but I also attempted to find other companies that wouldn't be the first to come to your mind when looking at AI beneficiaries today. 

# Our Methodology

To select our stocks, I  looked at which companies analysts are expecting to benefit from the AI boom and shortlisted them based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter of 2023.

2023-06-03 04:32:58,r/stocks,Google(GOOG) DCF: AI,"# Introduction:

With all the hype around AI and NVDA, this could be a strong catalyst for launching GOOG into its intrinsic value. Most of the climb had already taken place over the weeks. But, given that currently AI is the flavor of the month I'd be a little worried about adding more positions into GOOG. As a disclaimer, I have positions on GOOG since last year that I've been closing out and cashing in on my gains. I've linked my DCF, Revenue model and Cost model all at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

# REVENUE:

  
***Cloud***  
%Rev, Cloud is an area gaining massive traction due to how much convenience it adds, And the switching cost of cloud is massive, having to port over the entire database into competitors and retraining employees, so the loyalty of Cloud customers are strong.   
So, I’d argue that Cloud starts becoming a big part of GOOG’s identity.  
  
Y/Y, Cloud grows at CAGR of 19% according to ([SOURCE](https://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/news/cloud-computing-market-size-is-projected-to-surpass-usd-2972-6)). I believe GOOG to be capable of capturing most of that 19%. But, 19% may be overly optimistic as it requires for the next 8 years about 40+% Y/Y which seems unrealistic to me, given how cloud is already such a large part of GOOG. So I used a Y/Y CAGR of 13.32%  
  
***Advertising***  
%Rev, Advertising is still going to be a big part of GOOG’s identity, however with cloud gaining traction Advertising's role may be diminished.   
  
Y/Y, Advertising will see its Y/Y tapering off rather than taking off. I’d argue that the growth of AI related technology like ChatGPT may render GOOG’s search less effective given how ChatGPT seems to be an enhanced Google Search. Luckily, GOOG's has its own contender of ChatGPT, Bard. Bard is trained on Audio data whereas ChatGPT is trained on text data, so the effectiveness of these AI is dependent on how the user inputs data for the AI to process. Ultimately, which AI will take off is dependent on which modal of communication consumers prefer.   
Recently, GOOG has announced its plans to launch Duet AI, AI to help augment the experience on both cloud and Search. It’s definitely a step forward in the right direction, Duet AI could be complementary to Google’s already dominant search as not every search will likely be using AI due to how long that would take.   
  
***Others***  
%Rev, With so many components in Others, there may be less focus placed on this segment of the business so it’ll take a smaller pie of GOOG’s revenue.  
  
Y/Y, I opted to use historical average as granularity seems to be inaccurate here.  
  


# COST:

***TAC***  
Given the competitiveness of Competing technology against GOOG’s main Traffic generator, I’d argue that it could be significantly costlier to acquire traffic overtime. Recently I've been reading Homo Deus which made a fair point about Dataism. As our data interpreter (AI) gets more and more accurate, you'd be at a disadvantage to not use AI in your day to day life. So if we have this paradigm shift of trusting and relying on AI, TAC has a huge potential of decreasing. But, given how little regulation and promising technology on AI there has been so far this may be either too far out into the future or just impossible entirely.  
  
***COST OF REVENUES***  
GOOG has lumped Content Review, Content Acquisition and Data Centre together in COST OF REVENUES.  
  
1. Content Review: Needing Employees to manually sieve through content for compliance. As the service gets more popular, more content means needing more employees. (Variable Cost) BUT I'd argue that it could be a negligible one overtime as AI gains dominance and can track content in place of humans. (Fixed Cost)  
  
2. Content Acquisition: GOOG has stated it uses a cost price model for determining the amount of content acquired. (Variable Cost)  
  
3. Data Centre: Fixed infrastructure in place, but more of Data center used means GOOG needs higher bandwidth which means higher cost (Variable Cost)  
Since these are variable costs, I’d argue the extent that GOOG can reduce these costs to improve margins are limited.  
  
***R&amp;D***  
R&amp;D the cornerstone of GOOG’s business philosophy will always retain a fixed % of revenue. As evident from historic data where the spread of R&amp;D with respect to Revenue was rather small.  
So, R&amp;D maintains a fixed % with respect to revenue. But eventually when GOOG matures, I’d argue that R&amp;D tends downwards.  
  
***Sales &amp; Marketing + G&amp;A***  
Sales &amp; Marketing + G&amp;A also followed the same historic patterns of R&amp;D where they always occupied the same % with respect to revenue with a small spread.  
So, Sales &amp; Marketing + G&amp;A occupies a fixed % with respect to revenue. But eventually when GOOG matures and develops a strong branding relies less on marketing so it tends downwards a little.   


# COST OF CAPITAL:

WACC calculation a little too messy to input here so I'll link it   
WACC: ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/D48GrJl))

# CONCLUSION:

  
GOOG is priced at $146.02, GOOG’s recent innovations have been made only in response to competitors. It’s more reactive rather than proactive which may be a bad thing given how strongly ChatGPT has since established its dominance over GOOG. For GOOG to improve its valuation it needs to peer deeper into the AI realm and look towards augmenting AI to compliment its advertising segment e.g. Using AI to help advertisers or to manage Ad Inventory.

2023-04-26 00:33:00,r/stocks,Help with strategy: Swing Trading (Large Capital/Small profits),"Hello, I have been trading stocks and options for 3 years now and have built up my account to a modest size after incurring heavy losses buying calls and puts and just generally bad stock picks.
I built my account up using a combined strategy of selling puts and swing trading MSFT, GOOG, and some other stable stocks. 
My question is regarding using large capital (say $10000) to make small, quick daily profits (tune of $100-150; +1-1.5%) only using safe stocks like MSFT with good amount of swings. I keep some cash (20% of allocated amount) to double down. Is this viable? Risk is that I get some draw downs if there is a big sell-off (but I’ll still hold/double down since I am confident that MSFT is undervalued based on Morningstar reports, their earnings, etc.). Is it a good strategy if I am thinking I just need to cover daily costs (like eating out, for instance)? Is there something I am not seeing? If so, please let me know. I would appreciate any advice.

Is there a ETF screener that will spit out ETFs that have the stocks I am interested in holding ideally with a decent amount of weight in said ETF.

1) Aapl
2) Mcd
3) Pepsi
4) ABT &amp;ABBV
5) JNJ
6) MSFT
7) WMT
8) GOOG/Googl

4-8: I would love to have all of these be weighted as close as possible to each other.

Edit: For anyone wondering the same thing , I decided to buy individual stocks instead of and ETF. Paying a high MER for an ETf that I liked the portfolio and weighting of is annoying and unnecessary. I like selling “safe covered calls” so this works out well.

# [Stock futures are little changed as Wall Street awaits more earnings: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/16/stock-futures-climb-as-wall-street-awaits-more-bank-earnings-live-updates.html)
*****
&gt; Stock futures were flat Monday, with investors preparing for more quarterly earnings reports.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 gained about 0.1%, while Nasdaq-100 futures traded flat. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures ticked up 58 points, or 0.17%.
*****
&gt; Charles Schwab is set to report earnings later in the day. The stock has been under pressure recently, as traders feared the brokerage may suffer a similar fate to regional banks Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. However, the company has defended its financial position, noting last month it has a low loan-to-deposit ratio. Schwab shares are down 39% year to date.
*****
&gt; Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are slated to report earnings Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively. Investors have been eyeing the overall health of the sector after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last month spurred a liquidity crisis. Other notable names outside of financials, including electric vehicle heavyweight Tesla will report second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, while Procter &amp; Gamble reports on Friday.
*****
&gt; Corporate earnings got off to a positive start last week as banking giants Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase beat expectations. But discouraging retail sales data showed a slowdown in consumer spending by 1% in March pulled markets lower Friday.
*****
&gt; As companies grapple with sticky inflation and higher rates, many investors have braced for a downbeat earnings reports, but data from Bank of America suggests that this earnings reporting season may already be faring better than expected. Of the companies that reported during the first week, 90% topped EPS estimates. That marks the best beat rate to start earnings season since at least 2012, the Wall Street firm said.
*****
&gt; For the week, however, stocks remained resilient. The Dow was positive overall last week for the fourth straight time, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both had their fourth week in the green in five.

2023-04-03 23:37:36,r/stocks,"Digital Age for Big Oil using Big Tech $HAL &amp; $MSFT ; $AMZN &amp; $BP, $SHEL","[https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/How-New-Technology-Will-Disrupt-The-Oil-And-Gas-Industry.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/How-New-Technology-Will-Disrupt-The-Oil-And-Gas-Industry.html)

 

At a certain point in its lifecycle, every industry faces its moment of reckoning with growing pressure to transform due to factors such as increasing competition, changing consumer preferences, government policy and other secular headwinds. The transformation usually takes the shape of improved supply chain discipline as well as streamlining business operations in order to achieve better operating margins.

For the oil and [natural gas](https://oilprice.com/admin/articles/Energy/Natural-Gas/Natural-Gas-A-Comprehensive-Guide-To-The-Worlds-Most-Crucial-Fuel.html) industry, the moment of truth arrived a few years ago after years of weak benchmark prices, shrinking margins and massive capital flight forced the sector to seriously rethink the way it does business with energy companies increasingly turning toward tech heavyweights for help in cutting costs and streamlining operations. 

A good case in point is [a partnership](https://www.hartenergy.com/news/halliburton-teams-advance-digital-capabilities-microsoft-accenture-188653) struck between **Haliburton Co.** (NYSE:HAL), **Microsoft Inc.** (NASDAQ:MSFT) and **Accenture Plc.** (NYSE:ACN) in 2020. For years, Haliburton, one of the world’s largest oilfield services companies, has been plagued by shrinking margins and chronic underperformance. The company eventually made a deal with the two cloud giants to migrate its existing data centers to cloud and enhance digital offerings.

 Halliburton is hardly alone.

After years of dilly-dallying, oil and gas companies are now rapidly moving their IT infrastructure out to the Cloud as well as adopting Business Process Management (BPM) systems. This frequently results in a leaner, more agile organizational model whilst delivering significant cost savings.

Barclays estimates that the upstream market digital services industry will grow from less than $5 billion in 2020 to a more than $30 billion annual tab by 2025, thus enabling $150 billion in annual savings for oil producers. Opportunities for cost savings include cutting capital expenditures (capex) as well as selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) costs and transportation operating costs.

According to Barclays, the digital age is finally dawning for the energy sector with the market poised to erupt over the next five years. Over the past few years, Microsoft has struck cloud partnerships with several Big Oil companies including **ExxonMobil** (NYSE:XOM), **Chevron Inc**. (NYSE:CVX) and Haliburton while Google’s parent company **Alphabet Inc.** (NASDAQ:GOOG)[ has significantly expanded](https://www.slb.com/newsroom/press-release/2019/pr-2019-0513-slb-google-cloud) its partnership with **Schlumberger Ltd.** (NYSE:SLB), another oilfield services giant. Meanwhile, **Amazon Inc.** (NASDAQ:AMZN) offers digital services to the industry through Amazon Web Services[ oil and gas division](https://aws.amazon.com/), and counts **BP Plc**. (NYSE:BP) and **Shell Plc** (NYSE:SHEL) among its top clients.

 

In many cases, Big Oil’s digital makeover is quite extensive.

For instance, Halliburton kicked off multiple digital transformation projects during the pandemic. Thailand’s PTT Exploration and Production and Kuwait Oil Company were among the notable oil and gas companies that were awarded Halliburton contracts to implement digital transformation and enhance efficiency and production at their oilfields. 

For years, Big Oil has been using tech companies’ enterprise software in their highly complex operating systems--including  rig management operations and precise drilling techniques. However, they have traditionally been somewhat reluctant to hand over their treasure troves of valuable data mainly on cyber security concerns as well as the need to maintain competitive advantages, preferring instead to develop most of their software developed in-house or by companies within the oilfield services sector such as Haliburton. 

However, this is now changing as they look for ways to improve operational efficiencies in a bid to squeeze higher cash flows and profits from their existing operations. 

Is the new approach working? The evidence seems to suggest so, with shale drilling costs on an encouraging downtrend. **J.P. Morgan** estimates that Permian's Delaware Basin oil drillers now require oil prices of just \~$33/bbl to break even down from $40/bbl in 2019. ",21,14,drew-gen-x,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12ays6h/digital_age_for_big_oil_using_big_tech_hal_msft/,12ays6h

On Monday I sell $10,000 worth of AMZN to purchase $10,000 of AAPL  
On Tuesday I sell all shares of AAPL to purchase $10,000 of TSLA  
On Wednesday, I sell all TSLA shares to purchase $10,000 of GOOG

In this scenario, I would incur a good faith violation, correct? Because I used the proceeds of a sale to purchase another security and then sold the newly purchased security before the original funds used to make that purchased had settled? Or am I incorrect?

Most of my accounts are margin accounts, but I have 1 non-margin account that I am interested in doing this type of daily swing trading in and I'm trying to understand how good faith violations work and if this is possible without incurring violations.

I’m very much a ‘set it and forget it’ type of investor. 

Yes, I know that these are covered to a large degree in index funds, but I want to double-down on good, profitable companies that might “own the future”, so to speak. I’ve identified these three from an AI, cloud, entreprise software and infrastructure, and/or hardware and devices perspective. 

Thing is, I can’t wrap my head around how a $1T+ company gets any bigger. Will we be talking about the mega cap floor as being in the $1T+ range in a few years? Will we have ‘giga cap’ next in the $5T range? Seems mind-boggling.

Hoping someone with experience over the decades can lend some wisdom. 

I’d also like to hear your opinions on $GOOG, $MSFT, and $AAPL and their ability to grow by a substantial degree in the next 5-10 years.

The argument in this article is quite simple: Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (""Google"") is undervalued based on the Buffett 10x EBT (earnings before taxes) rule. It is selling at a valuation of around 13x FW EBT only after its cash position is adjusted. At such a valuation, the market essentially views Google as a terminally stagnating business. A 13x FW EBT already provides close to 8% of pretax earnings earning yield, making it equivalent to owning an equity bond with a similar yield (bond yields are all quoted on a pretax basis). Any growth will be a bonus at this valuation.

To be more specific, as of this writing, Google's stock price is about $98 per share. And my estimate for its 2023 EPS is about $5.8 per share and its tax rate is about 14%. And finally, do not forget that it has about $9 of net cash position sitting on its balance sheet (more on this later). Putting all these numbers together, its current valuations turn out to be ~13x FW EBT after the cash position is subtracted from its stock price.

At such a valuation, Google is essentially viewed by the market as a terminally stagnating business, according to Buffett's 10x EBT rule.",125,35,msaleem,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10mucgb/google_stock_is_approaching_buffett_10x_ebt/,10mucgb

2023-01-21 16:59:50,r/stocks,Apple's business is simply an earnings machine. ROC comparison: Apple (23.7%) vs. Alphabet (12.3%) vs. Amazon (5.7%),"Source: Apple: Why Recent Underperformance Is A Buying Opportunity

Over the last few months, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has done something that it doesn't often do: underperform. Since the company's last earnings call on October 27th, the stock has broken away from the broader market, returning -4% while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has delivered 8.5%.

The reason for this short-term underperformance isn't exactly obvious. Apple, after all, reported record revenues in its October earnings release, and Tim Cook announced that the company has yet to feel the sting of consumer softness in the economy.

Investors, however, don't seem to have believed him.

From worries about production issues in China to softening demand for the iPhone that investors seem certain will materialize at some point, investors just seem plain worried that something will go awry at the world's largest company. We contend in this article that these concerns are overblown and that the current underperformance represents a buying opportunity.

The China Worry

Apple has faced down a multitude of investor worries regarding its relationship with China. Apple has been accused of being too cozy with China, of making secret deals with China, of having its supply chain being too exposed to China, and of being cowardly when it comes to China.

While the veracity of these claims are better left to other authors, we don't think we're overstepping by saying that China has been made into a bogeyman for Apple investors. Apple has arguably done better than almost any other American corporation at walking the fine line that western companies must navigate in order to successfully do business in China.

The current top-of-mind China worries for Apple investors, however, are supply-chain issues and questions surrounding lockdowns and China's notorious zero-COVID policy. As long as the country is locking up millions of its citizens in forced isolation, things will be difficult for Apple.

Investors were delivered good news recently, then, when Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese officials were scaling back COVID lockdowns, potentially re-opening the economy at a much faster pace than expected. Importantly, Vice Premier Hiu Le told an audience at Davos that Beijing's focus this year would be on ""boosting domestic demand.""

In other words, we believe that Chinese leadership's struggles with large scale problems such as population decline and slumping economic growth make it less likely to rock the boat with Apple, at least in the near term.

All of this bodes well for Apple's business in China, which beat analyst estimates last quarter with $15.6 billion in revenue. Apple further stands to gain in the near term from the collapse of the U.S. dollar's 2022 rally.

A strong dollar reduces a company's international sales because when revenues are recorded in dollars (as Apple's are), they must be converted. When one Yuan converts to fewer and fewer dollars, the effects on the income statement quickly mount. Thus, the dollar's recent decline is good news for Apple and American companies conducting business overseas in general. The easing of FX headwinds should give Apple's international sales--and Chinese sales in particular--a welcome boost.

A Robust Product Pipeline

Steve Jobs is rumored to have said at one point that Tim Cook wasn't ""a product guy."" The long line of releases that Apple has in store for 2023 would probably beg to differ.

Only three weeks into the new year, Apple has already re-launched its HomePod product as well as a slew of new Mac variations. A full list of potential releases can be found here, but amidst the rumors of an Apple Car, something else very interesting has emerged--an Apple VR headset, reportedly ready for launch this year.

This is the product that, we think, should keep Mark Zuckerberg awake at night. Meta (META) has been at the forefront of the VR headset realm for some time since it purchased Oculus in 2014. Widespread adoption of the technology, however, has been a bit slow to catch on, which could have something to do with the fact that Meta is not principally a hardware company.

Apple, of course doesn't have this problem. If the product does in fact launch in 2023, we expect that it will be maniacally engineered and deliver a user experience unmatched by current technology. Combine this with Apple's dedicated user base and app ecosystem, as well as Apple's influence with developers, and it's quite possible to envision Apple launching VR adoption into the mainstream.

History is on our side with this claim. At its launch the iPad was met with a notorious level of criticism. Many companies had attempted to create a tablet in previous years (including Apple--remember the Newton?), but just couldn't quite pull it off. The Apple Watch, too, was met with similar skepticism.

In short, if anyone can pull off a VR coup, we believe Apple can.

A Compelling Valuation

Over the past five years, Apple's stock has maintained a fairly consistent relationship to forward EBITDA.

Overlaid against each other, the stock has consistently tracked above forward EBITDA estimates. In 2022, estimates began to flatten as inflation took hold and recession fears set in and the relationship reversed, with the stock price falling beneath forward EBITDA. We believe that the current inversion of this historical relationship presents an attractive opportunity for investors. This reflects our belief that Apple's stock won't be stuck in the doldrums forever.

Analysts, too, believe that Apple has better days ahead.

Of the 45 analysts estimates tracked, the average price target is $168.82. With its current price of $135, Apple has an almost 25% upside to its consensus target.

Normally we take analyst targets with a grain of salt, but an interesting pattern seems to emerge in the lower pane of the above chart--each time Apple's stock price slumps causing the distance between price and target price to exceed 20%, the stock tends to respond to the upside.

Some investors may agree up to this point but wonder--why, in the face of rising interest rates, does Apple continue to deserve such a premium valuation? Shouldn't Apple, at some point, be affected by the same gravity that has pulled down the likes of Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) in the last year?

We're glad you asked, because a piece of the Apple puzzle that we believe is under-reported is the company's sheer efficiency. Apple's business is simply an earnings machine, reporting world-class returns on capital quarter after quarter.


In the last 10 years, Apple has averaged an eye-popping 23.7% quarterly return on capital, and performance over the past two years has been even stronger. For reference, we prefer return on capital over other metrics such as return on equity since ROC can be directly compared to a company's estimated cost of capital. Comparing those two figures is helpful in inferring the profitability and sustainability of a business.

Now, just for kicks, let's compare Apple's reported ROC with Alphabet and Amazon.

It isn't even close. Compared with Apple's 23.7% ROC, Alphabet's average quarterly ROC over 10 years was 12.3% (the bars in white), while Amazon's was 5.7% (the bars in red).

Apple really is that good.

The Bottom Line

In sum, we believe that Apple shares present a highly compelling opportunity for investors.

Apple's business is world-class, with best-in-industry returns on capital that continue to justify a premium valuation.

Fears about China--including FX headwinds--may dissipate or prove less impactful than feared.
Apple continues to innovate and is expected to bring fresh products to market in 2023.

There currently exists a price-EBITDA discrepancy which could present a compelling entry or position building point.

We believe a price of $165 for Apple is a fair target. That price represents a 24x multiple on estimated 2024 earnings, which is well within the stock's historical multiple trading range. We believe the premium multiple is justified for the reasons outlined above.",1335,133,msaleem,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10hueqy/apples_business_is_simply_an_earnings_machine_roc/,10hueqy
2023-01-17 00:24:43,r/stocks,Why I Love GOOG and GOOGL,"( current investment = \~1000 in GOOG and GOOGL )

I really like google due to two reasons: **its ""conglomerate-like"" build, as well as its experimentation.**

With major positions surrounding the tech industry from **Google Search**, to YouTube, to the Pixel Phone, to the Android OS, to the Google Nest, to Chromebooks, to Google Drive &amp; Gmail and more! There's so many different areas in the tech space which Google either conquers (in terms of Google Search which holds close to 85% of search engine use according to [Statistica](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/#:~:text=As%20of%20December%202022%2C%20online,share%20of%20around%2084.08%20percent).

Google also owns the 2nd most used social media **Youtube**, according to [Statistica](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/). Youtube maintains its place as ""the place to go for long-form video watching."" DIY, its on YouTube. You need to learn something? It's on Youtube. They make most of their Youtube money through the advertising, yet they also make money through Youtube Premium and Youtube TV. YouTube Premium is able to profit off of content that millions make and just have to give a commission to the creators rather than using funds before making it like Netflix and other streamers must do for their content. 

**YouTube TV** gives Google the ability to compete in the expanding streaming industry against giants such as Netflix and Disney. They have a built-out subscription model which collects revenue monthly through its users.

Google's ownership of **Android**, as well as the Pixel phone hardware line gives them a vertical integration in order to have a more powerful stance over the abilities of their phones. This gives them more options for supply chain management and optimization as well as they don;t have to rely on another company for implementation of the hardware itself.

The **Google Play Store** is also one of the only competitors to the App Store. [It generated 10.34 billion in JUST Q3 of Last year](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/app-revenues/). Several million have used the store in order to install apps, as well as many creators prefer it to the app store, due to its more lax rules on app requirements.

**Chromebooks** as well as the Google Workspace are huge revenue-generating segments that intertwine Google with education (as kids in school are using Chromebooks and Google Classroom) as well as the professional world. While Chromebooks may not be extremely powerful machines, they address a market for the people who simply want a simple computer that they can complete simple online tasks with. Google sold roughly [30 million Chromebooks](https://www.statista.com/statistics/749890/worldwide-chromebook-unit-shipments/) in 2022 alone, showing that demand is for sure still there.

Google has **Google Workspace**, a fierce competitor to Microsoft's 365 (Office). While Microsoft does conquer this product type, Google does hold a fair amount of market share and recognition in its Google Workspace (G Suite) product. 

Google is also working on **Flutter**: an open-source UI software development kit which is used to develop cross-platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase.

Google also has several different speculative ""moonshots"" as they refer to them which furthers Google place as an ""unconventional"" company which can use its innovative edge to pass competitors and conquer the industries in which it involves itself with.

2023-01-08 02:58:22,r/stocks,Amazon(AMZN) DCF Analysis need criticisms and advice,"# HISTORY:

The story of AMZN is one of trials and tribulation, it was not always smooth sailing where valuation steadily rose over the years. Rather, it was one that required a visionary CEO, one who had sufficient foresight to take gambles that paid off, one who could stomach the choppy seas of business cycles, one who had the determination and patience to see through their largest gambles. Having a humble beginning, AMZN’s IPO MC was valued at $430 Million before losing 95% of their valuation in the tech bubble crash. AMZN managed to survive the tech bubble crash but their valuation held rather steady at around 17 billion in the early 2000s. Meaning investors believed that AMZN could no longer grow past this threshold and have matured. Reaching 17 billion in valuation by itself would’ve been an impressive feat but it wouldn’t be enough for a story worthy for the history books as companies like WMT had a valuation of about 200 billion at the same point in time. AMZN released prime in 2005, their X factor to differentiate themselves from their competitor. Net income was 588 million that year but due to large investments into prime net income in 2006 fell to 190 million nearly 67%. Consequently, from 2005 to 2006 AMZN's MC fell nearly 20%  as investors did not fully believe in prime. But Jeff Bezos, believing in his dream for fast shipping, was unfazed by the whole ordeal and carried on investing heavily into the retail business. And this investment paid off as today we know AMZN as the 5th largest company by market cap in the world.

Tl;dr: Jeff Bezos I love you please sponsor my University fees.

# INTRODUCTION:

AMZN business model involves a few revenue sources, in no particular order.

1. Online Retail + Physical Store (AMZN Store): Their online retail website that generates the bulk of revenue, as physical stores have mostly stagnated and occupy a meager amount of revenue I'll combine both Online Retail and Physical Store into AMZN store in my DCF.
2. Amazon Web Services(AWS): Their cloud computing services which helps take businesses big and small into the cloud. Providing servers as well for firms. Brian Olsavsky described AWS as a business that helps firms change their fixed cost into variable cost, meaning firms pay more as they use more.
3. Third Party Services(3P): AMZN has extended their retail transport capabilities to their competitors allowing third party to set up their store on the webpage, leaving the problem of transporting the goods to AMZN.
4. Advertising: The latest significant addition to AMZN's top line, AMZN sold the capability for advertisers to have their products more visible to customers on their retail store and providing tools for advertisers to analyze the data collected.
5. Subscription: Lastly, Amazon Prime. Consisting of Prime video, Prime Gaming and Prime shipping.
6. Others: representing the other businesses that AMZN has tried breaking into like Twitch but for simplicity sake and because Others represented about 0.5% of revenue in 2021 I'll not forecast this in my DCF.

# REVENUE:

**AMZN store**:  
2022, Retail has been hit pretty hard due to inflationary pressures and Ukraine War bumping up costs. Retail has definitely taken a hard beating for 2022. As per 2022 Q3 earnings transcript, ""reduction in fulfilment and transportation capital investment...to better align with demand."" We can expect revenue to have taken a hit and definitely lower than 2021's 22% Y/Y.

Past 2022 however, I expect AMZN store to pick up as there is a large demand for the convenience provided by AMZN.  ""more than 90 percent of consumers expect two- to three-day delivery as the norm, while 30 percent expect same-day delivery."" - [(JPMorgan,1)](https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/treasury-payments/insights/why-shopping-has-changed-forever). Only AMZN is well situated in terms of fulfillment center, transportation and capacity for expansion to meet this goal. In fact, AMZN is expected to be the largest e-commerce platform world wide by 2027 [(Statista,2)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/) earning about 1.2 Trillion.

AMZN store is likely to have very high growth going into 2023 until at least 2025. It took AMZN about 2 years to double their fulfilment network from 2019 - 2020 hence the negative cash flows back then. So I'm assuming AMZN is going to be an aggressive grower with high revenues and low margins as AMZN will be expanding into new markets it'll probably minimally need to spend another 2 years doubling its current size. Hence I project high growth period from 2023 - 2025.  


**AWS:**  
2022, firms are likely to be more conservative in these uncertain times preferring to have more cash reserves in hand. AWS offers a pay-as-you-go approach, not requiring firms to tie up large capital into AWS and AWS helps business to reduce cost. As per 2022 Q3 earnings transcript, ""we've seen an uptick in AWS customers focused on controlling cost"" All that being said, I don't really expect any crazy amount of growth in AWS as companies are more likely to have their capital tied up in footing the bill for higher labor cost. Even management forecast growth ""more in the mid 20% growth rate"". Compared to 2021's Y/Y at 37.1% so 2022's Y/Y is about 13% lower than 2021's Y/Y growth rate.

AWS is likely to have high growth as well going into 2023 as management announces plans to introduce AWS to more regions ""launch of the AWS middle east region in August and the recent announcement to launch AWS Asia Pacific."" The cloud computing is a whole new realm of endless opportunities for Amazon to capitalize on, with the market expected to grow from 548 billion in 2022 to 1240 billion in 2027, [(marketsandmarkets,3)](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/cloud-computing-market-234.html) AWS being in a good spot at about 38% market share as of Q1 2022, [(statista, 4)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/967365/worldwide-cloud-infrastructure-services-market-share-vendor/) to capitalize on this large market. Similarly I expect high growth period from 2023 - 2025.  


**3P:**  
I was thinking about how exactly should I go about forecasting third party but due to a lack of available data I actually forecast 3P with respect to AMZN store.

Of course this was not just a random guess, 3P has always observed a direct relationship with AMZN store. Taking 3P revenue as a percentage of AMZN store from 2016 - 2021 that number has held steady at  a range of 25% - 43%, it makes logical sense as well for 3P to have a direct relationship with AMZN store as 3P are retailers facing the same economical environment faced by AMZN store.

So throughout my DCF, I took 3P's revenue as 33% of AMZN store, 33% is the average of 25% and 43%.3P undergoes same growth period Y/Y as AMZN store.

&amp;#x200B;

**Subscription:**  
Subscription was treated the same as 3P. My rationale for this was that you have to use AMZN store in order for a subscription to Amazon Prime to be useful for you. At least anecdotally, barring lord of the rings I have not really heard of any memorable titles on Prime Video. In fact, ""Seventy-nine percent of Amazon Prime users cite **free shipping** as the primary reason they subscribe to the service"", [(chainstoreage,5)](https://chainstoreage.com/technology/the-no-1-reason-people-subscribe-to-amazon-prime-is#:~:text=Seventy-nine%20percent%20of%20Amazon,%2C%20Twitch%2C%20or%20other%20benefits).

Subscription from 2016 - 2021 when taken as a percentage of AMZN store held steady at a range of 7% - 13%.

So throughout my DCF, I took Subscription's revenue as 10% of AMZN store, 10% being the average of 7% and 13%. Subscription undergoes same growth period Y/Y as AMZN store.  


**Advertising:**  
2022, I'd expect advertising to fall as the advertising industry has proven to be a cyclical one. Using GOOG as a proxy for example, advertising revenue for GOOG actually decreased Y/Y in Q3 so similar results can be expected for AMZN.

I won't expect very high growth for Advertising however as it is quite limited in terms of what can be advertised as compared to GOOG. For example, GOOG is able to advertise service companies but AMZN may not be able to advertise services on the retail webpage.

Regardless, AMZN is still a strong player in the advertising industry. By 2023, AMZN is expected to earn 7.1% of revenue in the digital advertising market worldwide, [(statistia,6)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/290629/digital-ad-revenue-share-of-major-ad-selling-companies-worldwide/).

I wouldn't expect much high growth for advertising as not much exciting news or technology was introduced for advertising that would significantly increase revenue.  


# EBIT:

As per Q3 2022 earnings transcript, ""drop in operating margin...we're working hard to make sure that current profitability is not the new normal."" Margins have taken a hit in 2022 due to higher labor costs from the tighter labor market and the Ukraine War affecting gas prices which affects energy prices affecting AWS' margins. I'd expect 2022's margins to be smaller than historical margins. The latest 3Y average margin was at 5.47%. Due to AMZN starting to lay off workers on 4th Jan 2023, I'd assume the margins were hit pretty hard, for them to have to further reduce expenses. Margins assumed at 4.5%.

AMZN's margins are not likely to significantly increase from 2023 - 2025 as AMZN is going to continue heavily reinvest back into the company so margins are most likely to go back to the norm of 5.47% by 2025 at the end of the high growth period.

But, as AMZN goes off their high growth period from 2026 onwards, margins are going to increase as they stop focusing on growing their business but start to become mature. I'd assume margins are about 9% by the end of my forecast period in 2031.  


# ASSUMPTIONS:

1. Taxes are taken to be 20%, 2021's tax rate was 19.26% so I'd assume in this similar conditions as closely as possible taxes are about 20%.

# QUESTIONS &amp; NOTES:

1. **WHY DID I GUESS AWS AND AMZN STORE ARE THE COMPONENTS GOING THROUGH HIGH GROWTH?**  
As per 2021 Q4 earnings transcript, ""40% of that capex is going into infrastructure, most of it feeding AWS...About just under 30% is fulfillment capacity, building warehouses -- warehouse only, not transportation. And then just under 25% is transportation capacity and building on our NACL network, principally globally."" So we can see AMZN believes in the growth of AMZN store and AWS so I think it's justified in my DCF to assume high growth for both.
2. **WHY DOES HIGH GROWTH STOP IN 2025?**  
AMZN’s actual valuation is very heavily dependent on how long the high growth period lasts for. No guidance was given for how long this period is going to be, but a decent guess for this would probably be 2 years from 2023. 2022 was a period of contraction from AMZN navigating higher labor costs and the Ukraine War. 2023 would be a good starting point for AMZN to begin expansion. Given that the AMZN network took 2 years to double. If 2 years later it doubles again to quadruple it is most likely able to also support other regions outside of the US to a competent degree.
3. **INACCURACY IN FORECASTING ADVERTISING**  
Data available for advertising is actually quite limited due to a lack of information from management and historically advertising has only been reported from 2019 onwards. As more financial reports become available for advertising the degree of accuracy of prediction increases, unfortunately only 3 years of data from 2019 - 2021 is available. The story for advertising business in AMZN is sadly just too murky and vague right now for me to paint you guys a decent scene.
4. **How much AMZN’s margins are actually going to be after the high growth period?**   historically AMZN always had low margins as they reinvested back heavily to the company. Once again a lack of suitable historical data, where we can observe how high margins could be with an average economical condition and with all investments paying off. 9% may be cutting it too little for AMZN, but better safe than sorry.
5. **LASTLY,**   
All my forecasting are based on me weighing all the factors and adjusting their impact according to how much impact I think they have. 

# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, I value AMZN at $115.61, it is undervalued compared to market's $84. This difference can probably be attributable to how strong the market thinks AMZN's high growth will be compared to mine. But, I do think that there are a lot of doomsayers especially in the news where literally every other day I'd open my preferred news app and see at least 3 different article about how inflation has not eased off to a great extent. Barring short term expectations, I really do see AMZN being a strong company with great free cash flow potential. 2022's 10-K is definitely going to make or break how investors view AMZN moving forward, Questions like ""Can AMZN finally break their negative CF?"" will finally have an answer and give investor some kind of confidence. 4/5 of AMZN's revenue sources are cyclical so they'd be overly affected by the current environment's pessimism.   
I see this 37% of difference in price not as risk but rather as an opportunity because I believe AMZN will minimally bounce back 37% sometime in the future, the question is just when.

For the last time, I appreciate any advice or comments on my DCF I really spent quite a lot of time on this DCF juggling between scouring for data and army left me literally devoting 70% of my weekends getting data. I've read the story AMZN has told and retold it in my own account and I hope this value adds to anyone even if no advice was given!

HD at 20? Seems high imo but it’s a solid company.

2022-12-18 08:57:01,r/stocks,First ever DCF on GOOG. Need some Advice and Criticism on my thought processes when forecasting.,"Spreadsheet: [https://imgur.com/a/TLkzWt8](https://imgur.com/a/TLkzWt8)Revenue forecasting: [https://imgur.com/a/jHtuSgp](https://imgur.com/a/jHtuSgp)

Revenue:

Revenue mainly comes from Advertising, Cloud and Others and can be reliably forecasted. For simplicity sake, the first paragraph of each year will be %of revenue from Advertising, Cloud and Others. Second paragraph of each year will be Y/Y growth from Advertising, Cloud and Others.

**Cloud:**  
**2022:**  
% forecast: Due to covid, businesses were pushed to go digital so firms are more receptive to automation so Cloud is likely to take up a larger portion of revenue over time.  


Y/Y forecast: The average of 2020 - 2021 is taken when forecasting Y/Y cloud 2022 as these took into account the effects of covid, however a limitation recognised here would be that in 2022 high inflation led to high interest rates so Y/Y growth may not be so high.  


**2023 - 2024:**  
**%** forecast: I forecast that cloud will start taking up a larger percentage of revenue as the Fed do expect interest rates to come down by end of 2024 when interest rates fall businesses are likely to be able to invest in the business and automate.

Y/Y forecast: Due to a lack of industry knowledge I’m going to be conservative and assume a slightly higher than historic growth rate of 2% Y/Y per year from 2023 to 2024.

**2025 - 2026:%** forecast: I estimate cloud will probably peak at about 15% due to tougher competitions from AWS and market saturation.

Y/Y forecast: Due to the full effects of falling interest rates finally showing up due to the lag in policy in 2025, Y/Y increase is going to spike higher than past forecasted years.

**2027 - 2030:%** forecast: I estimate that cloud will probably plateau at about 13.5% onwards.

Y/Y forecast:  Revenue is plateaued to 47% as a conservative estimate

**Advertising:**

**2022:**% forecast: Advertising is going to decrease in terms of % of revenue due to decrease in retail spending and tougher inflation environment.

Y/Y forecast: To prevent Y/Y growth from being skewed by 2020 Covid, I only took the average of 2018-2019 where advertisers had the confidence of spending on advertisement without taking covid into consideration.

**2023 - 2025:**% forecast: Advertising is going to decrease in 2023 and 2024 due to high interest rates and uncertain environment for investors. A conservative 1% was used in decline as advertising is still GOOG’s core operations.

Y/Y forecast: Y/Y growth is assumed to be more conservative as advertising is a matured business of GOOG. But 2025 Y/Y growth will be higher due to lower interest rates.

**2026 - 2030:**% forecast: GOOG is likely to continue being a strong seller of advertisements and their expansion into different modal for google searches is likely to keep their advertisement revenue high.Y/Y forecast: Y/Y growth is harder to forecast due to uncertainty in interest rates policy from 2025 onwards.**Others:**% forecast: I’m uncertain of how exactly to accurately depict others but it is not something that GOOG focuses on especially when you listen to their past few earnings calls. So % I’ll just use others to top up till 100%

Y/Y forecast: Y/Y growth I’ll assume plateaus at about 18% due to strong competition from Apple.

&amp;#x200B;

**EBIT:**

The average of 2020 and 2021 were taken when forecasting 2022 as 2020 was when there were high layoffs due to covid uncertainty and 2021 was when there was low interest rates that allowed companies to reinvest more than usual.

GOOG is still reinvesting large sums back into cloud so EBIT is taken to decrease till 23% with reference to 2018 and 2019 where it seemed like a steady margin and the most efficiently run GOOG was.To be conservative I’ll just assume EBIT goes to 20% by the end of my forecast period.

**Taxes:**

Due to GOOG being high in R&amp;D I’d assume Taxes hold steady at 20% throughout my forecast.

**D&amp;A:**

Assumed to be at 7% throughout

**Deferred Taxes:**

Being a relatively small line item, I assume that deferred taxes are going to get smaller as GOOG would probably know how to value their PP&amp;E properly as more time goes on. But since it is a small line item, I just put it at a constant 1% to avoid over or undercompensating for it,

**Change in NWC:**

Assumed to be at 1% throughout

**CapEX:**

I assume GOOG is going to ramp up CapEX going into 2025 due to interest rates expected to be lowered by then. But over time as Cloud becomes matured I don’t see CapEX taking up a large portion so I tend it towards 10% just above D&amp;A

**WACC:**

COE, GOOG does not pay dividend yield so most of COE comes from average % price increase in its stock.I’d assume GOOG has a market beta of the average between 1.25 and 1.06  based on [https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/\~adamodar/New\_Home\_Page/datafile/Betas.html](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/Betas.html) GOOG is classified under information services? And [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/)Risk free rate at the time of 2021 was about 2%.

Risk premium was 5.5% based on [https://www.statista.com/statistics/664840/average-market-risk-premium-usa/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/664840/average-market-risk-premium-usa/)

COE = 8.35%

COD, GOOG’s bond yield was taken into consideration for this.

[https://cbonds.com/bonds/55087/#:\~:text=International%20bonds%3A%20Google%2C%203.625%25%2019may2021%2C%20USD%20(US38259PAB85)](https://cbonds.com/bonds/55087/#:~:text=International%20bonds%3A%20Google%2C%203.625%25%2019may2021%2C%20USD%20(US38259PAB85))

COD = 3.625%

%Equity = 100% - 30.37% = 69.62%%Liability = 97072/319 616 = 30.37%Tax Rate = 19% based on 2021’s Taxes

📷

Extract from GOOG’s 2021 10-K

Total WACC = 69.62% x 8.35% + 30.37% x 3.625% x (1 - 19%) = 6.71%

TGR = 2.5%

some very specific questions I have:

1. Is my Tax forecast by holding it at 20% unrealistic?
2. Is it okay to keep depreciation constant at 7% of sales?
3. Unsure of how exactly to accurately depict change in NWC?
4. Was there a better way of finding out WACC for GOOG?",29,15,Hanzoisbad,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zotc2o/first_ever_dcf_on_goog_need_some_advice_and/,zotc2o

2022-10-18 19:42:14,r/stocks,Facebook Parent Meta Ordered to Sell Giphy After Losing Fight in U.K.,"Facebook META -0.11%▼ owner Meta Platforms Inc. META -0.25%▼ said it would sell its social-media animated-images company Giphy after the U.K.’s top competition authority affirmed an earlier order to undo the 2020 acquisition.

Facebook’s announcement all but ends a yearslong saga in which a foreign regulator made a rare intervention in an already-consummated deal between two American companies. British regulators had ordered Meta to operate Giphy separately while the deal was under review.

Meta, then known as Facebook, bought Giphy in May 2020 for $315 million. The company, with offices in New York City and Los Angeles, allows users to search for, create and share short animated videos, or GIFs, which have become popular in social-media posts, texts and other communications.

The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority initially ordered Meta to sell Giphy last year. Meta appealed the decision. In July, the Competition Appeal Tribunal backed the CMA in five out of six challenges to the CMA ruling. On Tuesday, after taking that ruling into consideration, the CMA issued a revised decision that again ordered Meta to sell Giphy.

Meta said it is disappointed by the order, but it won’t appeal the decision further. The company said it would work with the CMA to sell Giphy and is awaiting more details in the coming weeks from the regulator about how it should do so.

The decision comes as the CMA is asserting itself on the global stage as a technology regulator—opening antitrust cases against tech companies alongside others stemming from the U.S. and European Union. The CMA has open cases looking at issues including how Alphabet Inc.’s GOOG 0.91%▲ Google brokers ads on third-party websites, and the control that the regulator says Apple Inc. and Google exercise over mobile-phone software. The companies say they comply with competition rules and are working with the regulator.

Meta’s acquisition of Giphy “would significantly reduce competition in two markets,” said Stuart McIntosh, chairman of the investigative team appointed by the CMA to review the deal. By buying Giphy, Mr. McIntosh said Facebook had removed a “potential challenger in the U.K. display ad market, while also giving Meta the ability to further increase its substantial market power in social media.” A sale of Giphy is the only way to address the issue, he said.

Meta had said in the past that consumers and Giphy are better off with the infrastructure and resources Meta can provide. The company said at the time of the deal that it would integrate Giphy into its Instagram platform.

The CMA began probing Meta’s Giphy deal soon after it was announced. Last fall, it fined Meta 50.5 million pounds, equivalent to $57.2 million, saying the company had failed to provide required updates outlining its compliance with the initial enforcement order in relation to the merger review. Meta at the time disputed the fine for what the company called a “best effort compliance approach.”

The move by the CMA isn’t an unprecedented one. In April 2020, it blocked Sabre Corp.’s tie-up with rival travel booking service Farelogix Inc., saying it was anticompetitive. The regulator said the deal could have reduced innovation in the sector and led to higher fees for certain products.

2022-10-02 01:33:04,r/stocks,What are your stock picks when the market eventually turns around?,"When the market turns around is anyone's guess. If I had to speculate I say we have a slight bounce in the coming weeks. I say this because it is common knowledge that October-January are the best months in the stock market if you look at history. Likewise, after the midterms in the second year of a president's term we tend to do well in the stock market. The reasoning behind this is because the stock market likes to have certainty on what policies will be approved or denied in the future. Will I be buying during this false bounce? Yes, I will be buying up a little into TQQQ to swing trade over the course of a few days here and there, selling once I make a 12% gain in under 4 days. 

Now for the meat and potatoes. What will you be buying up when the news eventually comes out that we are no longer having severe inflation problems? The perfect scenario would be Jerome Powell announces ""we are no longer going to remain hawkish, inflation is now under control ..."" and the rest will be history. Here is a breakdown of my portfolio picks when that day comes, which remember could be in a few months or in 2024, hell it could even be in 2026 for all I know. Right now my portfolio is about 95% cash. I will breakdown and explain each of these holdings: 

25% of portfolio will be in VOO - VOO is the lazy, set it and forget it ETF. It is not only great for long term growth, it also pays a nice dividend yield of 1.77%. 

20% of portfolio will be in SCHD - this is another good ETF that is good for growth and has an excellent 3.73%. 

10% of portfolio will be in GOOG - It's google, need I say more? 

10% of portfolio will be in TSLA - It's Tesla. They are the future. 

8% of portfolio will be in METV - This is a Metaverse ETF. 

8% of portfolio will be in SOFI - The future of banking. Millenials and Gen Z love this company. 

7% of portfolio will be in TQQQ at the start of the rally, and will be swung trade every few days to make a profit. 

2% of portfolio will be in CCL - I see Carnival Corporation doing well long term. In fact I almost want to buy and hold some after this recent sell off a few days ago.

2022-09-30 20:29:30,r/stocks,Why is Google Class A worth less than Google Class C?,"As the title indicates, I've noticed that Class A (GOOGL) shares of Alphabet stock always trade about 1% lower than Class C shares (GOOG). However, I don't understand as to why this is. As of time of writing, Class is is current $97+ whereas Class A is hivering just under $97.

As far as I can tell, there are two good reasons as to why this shouldn't make sense:

1) GOOGL offers the conventional one share = one voting write whereas GOOG offers no voting writes. This gives GOOGL real world utility and subsequently....from the outside view at least...greater value.

2) Larry Page and Sergey Brin own about 56% of GOOGL, making it an even more scarce asset and theoretically more valuable.

The only logical reason I can think of is that because Larry and Sergey own over 50% of the voting power, there is little reason to own Class A shares....but that surely cannot mean they are still worth less than shares with no voter rights, can it?

2022-09-29 22:59:13,r/stocks,"If you expect choppy waters in the market, why not daytrade a megacap that you'd be fine getting stuck with? (hold instead of sell 4 loss)","Let me explain a particular strategy, and then you can tell me why it's a horrible idea.

Ok, so let's say that your theory is that there will be plenty of pain in this market till at least Spring 2023 if not longer. However, you also know that along the way there's going to be plenty of rallies. Basically, you're expecting very choppy waters. Lots of red days, but occasional rallies.

Let's say you're interested in investing in something like AMD, NVDA, ADBE, MSFT or GOOG for example. You'd have no problem buying these stocks at their current 52 week lows, and holding them for 3 or 4 years or even longer.

For example, you could have bought some AMD today in the very high $62 range.

Now, you could of course just buy the stock, and forget about doing anything with it for the next 18 months. 

Another option though, would be to try to daytrade the stock as much as humanly possible, with one HUGE exception. You don't sell it for a loss.

Whenever you're down in the stock, you convert your mindset to the idea that you're holding for at least 18 months or longer. 

Now, why would anybody want do something like this? Well, it's back to the choppy waters idea. You believe the SPY will fluctuate from as low as 335 to as high as 405 over the next five or six months. Which means your AMD investment could dive to $48 per share, or pop to $78 per share. Just as possible examples.

However, your strategy would be to simply try to squeeze out very small victories on an intraday basis. 

I did this exact strategy today with AMD. I made a quick $500.

Now, making a quick $500 is nice, but I put a HUGE amount of money at risk to do it. I could have been stuck as a bagholder of AMD, for who knows how long. Now, luckily, I'm super bullish on AMD, and would have no problem bagholding at these levels in a worst-case scenario.

Although, I must admit that if my strategy was to buy AMD and hold for five years, I'd probably wait for the stock to fall to $55 or $53 or something before jumping in. Yes, I believe the stock will trade in this range in the not-too-distant future.

Also, a huge part of this strategy is not being greedy. When you are doing your daytrading strategy with whatever stock it is, you're just trying to bag a half a percent. Sometimes maybe even a quarter percent. So, for this to really be that big of a deal, you'd have to use some serious capital.

The downside, is that the market tanks really bad, and you're a bagholder that thought they got in at an awesome entry. Only to realize a few days later that there was nothing special about that entry and you're now underwater.",41,18,IHadTacosYesterday,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xriu6k/if_you_expect_choppy_waters_in_the_market_why_not/,xriu6k

2022-09-25 02:41:59,r/stocks,Just my 2 cents on what to do during all this selling off,"I am 29, so maybe I am naive and maybe I have just been lucky in the past. I did time March 2020 correctly with buying up stocks right before the very bottom. For context I bought up VOO, QQQ, W, AAPL, MSFT, TSLA all on March 20, 2020. The bottom was on March 23, 2020. I did not care if I had caught the bottom. I just new when I pressed ""buy"" on my brokerage accounts that I had a discount on all of these ETFs and stocks. Did I get lucky to some degree? Sure. Maybe. 

I sold almost everything in August 2022 for a slight profit (note that I sold everything in April 2022 and bought back in early July 2022: VOO, AAPL, MSFT, TSLA). I am up this year, while everyone around me is down. So my plan for this next week is to buy back up in mass quantity until I only have 5% of my portfolio in cash. I will be buying up VOO, QQQ, SCHD, METV, TSLA, GOOG, SOFI. I will consider buying up the following if and only if they dip another 3% the next week: NVDA, V. 

So, here is the dip people. This next week will not trade sideways because we just don't do that in the USA after a massive sell off like we have had. We will either trade up or down but not sideways. So starting Monday make your moves. Buy up ETFs and stocks you want to hold for years. I messed around with SQQQ and broke even twice this year.

2022-09-24 10:03:30,r/stocks,Safe long term investing but you can only trade individual stocks,"I’m an American expat in Europe and because of FATCA I am extremely limited in how I can invest. The only way I’ve found I can invest at all is small stock trades on Interactive Brokers.

I’d still like to invest a little of my money with every pay period with the goal of just indexing my money to inflation so I don’t lose money with every year that goes by. Problem is I can only buy stocks. As far as I know, I can’t even buy index funds.

2022-09-23 03:08:07,r/stocks,Unique Request - Take a Gander at my 110-Stock Portfolio,"As the title says, I have a portfolio with 110 different stocks.  A question I hear all the time, ""*Why not just own an ETF?"".* Simple answer - no ETF is perfect and why not create my own portfolio with stocks I have high conviction in? I have a nice mix of growth, dividend, income, speculative, international, etc. etc. 

Some background on me - I have a degree in Finance, have worked in the field for 4.5 years and have been doing my own investing for about 6.5. I like to pretend I am good at what I do, but let's be honest, I just got lucky in the decade-long bull market like most new investors and have been able to outperform the market in all years but one (I'll let you decide which of those years I got heavy into options trading lol).   


I do a quarterly deep-dive on my stocks, keep up on all relevant daily news, and spend 1-2 hours at night reading relevant publications (Barron's, Kiplinger, Seeking Alpha, Various Fund Letters), so I feel pretty confident in my ability to keep up on the stocks. But I love getting outside feedback.

2022-09-22 01:23:44,r/stocks,Meta Quietly Reduces Staff in Cost-Cutting Push,"Meta Platforms Inc. META -2.72%▼ is planning to cut expenses by at least 10% in the coming months, in part through staff reductions, as the social-media giant confronts stalling growth and increased competition, according to people familiar with the company’s plans.

The Menlo Park, Calif., company has begun quietly nudging out a significant number of staffers by reorganizing departments and giving affected employees a limited window to apply for other roles within the company, according to current and former managers familiar with the matter, in a move that achieves staffing cuts while forestalling the mass issuance of pink slips.

The reductions are expected to be a prelude to deeper cuts, according to people informed of the company’s plans. While some savings will come from cuts to overhead and consulting budgets, the people said, much of it is expected to come from reduced employment.

The moves come after weeks of Meta executives publicly discussing the need for hiring freezes and “ruthless prioritization” of its business, while avoiding use of the word layoffs.

In response to questions, Meta spokesman Tracy Clayton referred to CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s July statement that the company would need to reallocate resources toward corporate priorities as pressures mount on the business.

“We’ve been public about the need for our teams to shift to meet these challenges,” Mr. Clayton said. He said giving displaced employees a period to apply for new jobs is a means of retaining talent that Meta might otherwise lose. He declined to say how many employees have been affected by the recent moves.

The company has been slashing its guidance for operating expenses since the third quarter last year but hasn’t previously suggested it would reduce head count through means other than natural attrition.

Among some Meta employees, the process of reapplying for jobs within a limited window internally is known as a sort of human- resources purgatory they call the “30 Day List.”

Meta, as of last year the name of Facebook’s parent company, has long had a practice that employees whose roles are eliminated are subject to termination if they can’t find a new job internally within a month. Many other companies also make efforts to reassign employees whose groups are closed or restructured.

At Meta historically, it was usually only employees that were deemed undesirable who failed to land new positions. Now, affected employees and managers say, workers with good reputations and strong performance reviews are being pushed out on a regular basis.

Meta reported having 83,553 employees at the end of the second quarter, up 32% from a year ago.

As part of its own cost-cutting measures, Alphabet Inc.’s GOOG -1.79%▼ Google has also required some employees to apply for new jobs if they wish to remain at the company. Last week, Google told roughly half of the more than 100 employees at the company’s startup incubator Area 120 they would need to find other jobs at the company within 90 days, said people familiar with the decision.

Google typically gives employees 60 days to apply for other roles in the company if their jobs have been cut, though Area 120 employees usually receive more time if their projects are canceled, said people familiar with the process.

In March, more than 1,400 Google workers signed a petition demanding that the company extend the typical 60-day period to 180 days for a group of more than 100 employees in the cloud computing division, citing the “barriers to transfer that many workers face.”

A Google spokesman said almost 95% of employees who expressed interest in staying with the company found new roles within the notice period. Alphabet had 174,014 employees at the end of the second quarter, up 20.8% from the previous year.

In Silicon Valley, the staff reductions are notable after the biggest companies hired at breakneck speed through the pandemic. In May 2021, Tom Allison, head of the Facebook app, wrote a memo titled “Why is Hiring So Hard Right Now?” Mr. Allison lamented a “major supply and demand imbalance between our hiring needs and talent availability.” With the shortage of engineers most acute, the company was hiring more recruiters, he wrote, but even those were hard to find.

With the economic climate cooling and the digital-ad market in turmoil, the language from some prominent tech executives is now distinctly different.

“Realistically, there are probably a bunch of people at the company who shouldn’t be here,” Mr. Zuckerberg said at a company town hall in June. Separately, the company’s head of engineering issued a call for managers to identify employees who were coasting and place them on remediation plans as a prelude to their termination.

The memo’s brusque phrasing led to considerable jeering and angst in the company’s internal forums, according to posts viewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Meta’s share price is off more than 56.6% so far in 2022, and the company’s market value has dropped more than $685 billion since its peak in September 2021 as of the close on Tuesday.

Google has been more resilient but the search giant’s share price is also down 27.3% over the past year. In July, Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said Google would slow hiring for the rest of the year and urged employees to be “more entrepreneurial.” Mr. Pichai said at a conference earlier this month that he wanted the company to become 20% more productive, without providing details on how he would measure the improvement.

Snap Inc. is among the outliers in publicly announcing layoffs. The company last week said it would slash about 20% of its staff after growing its head count by around 65% since the end of 2020.

“We must reduce our cost structure to avoid incurring significant ongoing losses,” Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said in a memo to staff. He said the company was launching an opt-in talent directory to help departing employees find work outside the company.

Silicon Valley continues to be a competitive talent market, so finding ways to relocate employees within a company can produce benefits, said Allison Rutledge-Parisi, senior vice president of people at Justworks, a professional employee services company.

“It would be ridiculous for a company to jettison a group of people who they know, who they’ve managed, they have a relationship with, who’ve contributed, summarily without thinking through a methodology that would find them another place and another home within the organization,” she said.

There are also potential downsides to having employees compete for a limited number of internal positions, including hits to productivity and morale, said Dave Fisch, chief executive of careers site Ladders. “There’s going to be a lot of chatter, there could be a lot of animosity and finger pointing that naturally starts to arise,” Mr. Fisch said.

At Meta, the hustle to get rehired is well under way.

“I’m a fast learner who is keen to take on a challenge and evidently by this post, someone who’s not afraid to put herself out there,” wrote a Meta data scientist on an internal forum last month, in which she said she was looking for a new position. “You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take and I’d be kicking myself if I ended up leaving without exploring every avenue I could.”

2022-08-30 23:46:22,r/stocks,Perspective matters - comparing swing trading vs buy and hold in between 2002 and 2022,"I will make this post short and to the point: Good luck trying to beat the market by doing day or swing trading. I know people who try to do this full time who are smart and have the financial means to buy up tens of thousands of dollars of stock to try and buy then sell shortly after. Every single one of these people has a net loss from starting this. There are 14 of them I know - not a single one has come out ahead. Talk about not beating the odds. 

Here is the truth r/stocks folks: If you and I were bickering back in ***May 2002*** that AAPL would be dipping from its high of **$0.45** we would have been right. AAPL did in fact go down to **$0.33** in ***July 2002.*** Had you bought puts on AAPL at the right time in 2002 - yay for you. If you had tried to swing trade AAPL in 2002 you would have probably gotten burnt, but maybe not. 

Listen: The fact is the best thing you could have done is to have poured $1,000 into AAPL at anytime in 2002 and held for the next 20 years until today, even with AAPL taking a dip recently. You would have more than 300X you original cash invested. 

We can do the same thing with the more conservative way of investing, ETFs, since most experienced investors on r/stocks like these more than individual stocks (including myself). Let us take a look at a popular ETF you and I would know as SPY. SPY right now is worth $398. Sure, SPY was at $474 back in December 2021 and man it should ""would have been nice to have sold then"". . . ***April 2002 SPY trading at $119. December 2002 $87.*** 

My point with this post is simple: Buy, hold and enjoy your life. I am not saying buy and hold crappy high risk companies. Pour 75% of your portfolio in things like SPY, VOO and QQQ and don't touch them for decades. Hell, don't even look at them. 

Current positions: 

40% in SPY/VOO/QQQ ; 10% in SCHD ; 10% in VT ; 9% in AAPL ; 8% in GOOG ; 8% in SOFI ; 6% in TSLA ; 5% NVDA ; Approx. 4% remaining in cash. 

Buy. 

Hold.

I'm a Bogglehead, for the most part, that got a bit too invested in the rise in Tech in 2020 and 2021. I bought quite a bit of SE and SQ and am now down roughly 65% in each position. 

Rather than wait for these stocks to get back to my cost basis price, I had a thought to sell and invest the remainder into more concrete companies (what some are calling ""value Tech"") like AAPL, MSFT, or GOOG. I have exposure in each of these already via my ETFs, but thought that a direct position might help accelerate returns on what's been lost with SE and SQ.

Only thing is, to regain losses, AAPL, MSFT, or GOOG have to rise to substantial levels, basically becoming $4T companies. 

What are your thoughts? Should I stick with SE and SQ and hope for the best? Or, should I sell and invest into better Tech companies?

2022-07-27 02:59:28,r/stocks,Can you trust the data? $GOOG P/E valuation looks much better of what it really is.,"Quick question? What is Google (Alphabet) Forward P/E? If you answer something below 20 then you have been cheated.

The usual websites to show this data that are free are Yahoo Finance and Finviz.

Well, both commit the same mistake:

* [Forward P/E of $GOOG on Finviz: 16.30](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG)
* [Forward P/E OF $GOOGL on Finviz: 16.41](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOGL)
* [Forward P/E of $GOOG on Finviz: 19.01](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/key-statistics?p=GOOG)
* [Forward P/E of $GOOGL on Finviz: 18.90](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL/key-statistics?p=GOOGL)

Guess what? The real number is bigger than those! Because this websites are taking the earnings of Google as a whole but then they are splitting that earnings between half of the shares (half for $GOOG and half for $GOOGL as if those were independent companies!)

If that is not a pro-trick that deserves twice the valuation I don't know what it is. Hats off to Google!

The right number can be calculated from [their last earnings report](https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2022Q2_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf):

* Outstanding shares (Class A,B,C) =&gt; 64,402 Millions
* Total income on 2022-Q2 =&gt; 69,685 Millions
* Forward P/E at $110 the share = (64,402 \* 110) / (69,685 \* 4) =&gt; **25.41**

Another way to verify this is by checking that the float (or outstanding shares) reported on this websites is much less than the declared 64 Billions they declare on their earnings reports.",0,0,polloponzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/w90lfj/can_you_trust_the_data_goog_pe_valuation_looks/,w90lfj
2022-07-26 10:40:03,r/stocks,Big Tech earnings are about to determine the direction of the market,"Just five companies control nearly a quarter of the S&amp;P 500 index’s market cap, and they will all report earnings this week that could determine the direction of the market for weeks or months to come.

As Big Tech — Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, -0.36% GOOG, -0.14%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -1.05%, Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.74%, Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. META, -1.55% and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.59% — prepares to report, there are serious doubts about their near future for the first time. All five have signaled that they are cutting costs or plan to soon, as MarketWatch’s Jon Swartz reported.

Amazon ripped off the Band-Aid three months ago, and it looks like some of its Big Tech cohorts may look to do the same in this earnings season. Apple has reportedly planned cost cuts for next year, while Microsoft is closing down open positions and making small layoffs. Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told employees on the last day of the second quarter that they face one of the “worst downturns that we’ve seen in recent history,” and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai warned employees of slowing hiring just a few days after the quarter close. Results last week from Snap Inc. SNAP, -0.10% and Twitter Inc. TWTR, -1.51% show concerns about the digital-advertising business are founded. Even an early warning from Microsoft about its earnings and the knowledge that Amazon is already cutting costs may not be enough to truly prepare Wall Street for what may be coming. One area that could cause a major ripple is a slowdown in cloud-computing growth, as Therese Poletti opined, with one analyst telling her that “people are going to freak out.”

Any big moves for those five companies would have major ripple effects in the market. Collectively worth roughly $7.5 trillion despite the declines that have already struck this year, the five companies make up about 23% of the total market cap of the S&amp;P 500 index SPX, +0.13%, according to the Dow Jones Market Data Group. The group’s earnings and revenue have buffeted the entire market in recent years, as the COVID-19 pandemic juiced their balance sheets. Collectively, the quintet produced profit surpassing $320 billion last year, with sales topping $1.4 trillion, which would rank 13th in gross domestic product as a nation, just behind Brazil and ahead of Australia, according to World Bank figures.

This year is going to be a tough comparison to that performance, especially after Amazon reported a loss of nearly $4 billion in the first quarter. And cost-cutting from those companies will have an effect on the larger tech economy. The true concern in Silicon Valley and Wall Street is that a domino effect happens — Big Tech cuts costs, hurting smaller tech companies that rely on them, who in turn go under or at least cut back on costs such as cloud computing, cloud software, hardware and more, causing more pain throughout the industry.

We live in a world with potential shortages in Energy &amp; Food because capital/money has been so misallocated that everyone wants to BTD in $WBD or $AMD without thinking where is investment capital/cash going?

2022-07-03 04:04:51,r/stocks,Here are some stocks I’m strongly considering buying. What are yours ?,"$JPM: 
One of the best bank with now reasonably low P/E and respectable 3.5% dividend. 

$MFC: Manulife is a huge Canadian insurance and investments service provider. P/E is now 4.67 with a 5.80% dividend. 

$MPW: Medical properties trust. This is a bet on healthcare real estate. 8.3 P/E with a whopping 7.42% dividend.

I know there is more to it than P/E and dividends but I didn’t feel like writing my bull cases for each one
$INTC , $GOOG, $META (though I didn’t like what Mark Zuckerberg stated last week), $NFLX and $DIS are honourable mentions.

Feel free to comment or roast my watchlist. So many good companies at huge discounts.",321,109,Ecstatic-Use-3999,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/vq6ua2/here_are_some_stocks_im_strongly_considering/,vq6ua2
2022-06-16 22:56:29,r/stocks,Can AAPL get back to ATH in 4 years?,"Mentally it’s tough to keep buying with non-stop red days. Here’s a long term perspective to consider.

AAPL is now down 30%, but a return to all time high means a 183/129 = 42% return. If you’re happy with an average annual return of 10%, then buying now means AAPL has 4 years to get back to ATH in order for it to be a good investment for you. 

Obviously a faster return to ATH gives an even better average return. (I oversimplify the math a little by ignoring compounding)

A similar analysis on these blue chips shows that a return to ATH in,

- MSFT: 4.5 years

- GOOG: 5 years

- AMZN: 8 years

Would equate to an average annual return of ~10%. 

If your time horizon is more than a few years, these are great times to be in the market.


EDIT: Most people seem to think I'm legitimately asking the question in the title. I'm not, this is a way to mentally reframe the market outlook without any real analysis (just simple math).

My question is are there particular growth or value stocks recommended right now or is it better to sit on cash or is it better to add to current positions to balance returns?

2022-06-12 03:11:19,r/stocks,SPY is still 21% above pre-pandemic highs.,"Does anyone remember the pre-pandemic highs when everyone was saying the market was in a bubble and that market could crash upwards of 30% without a pandemic. well we are still 21% above that level even though interest rates are only getting higher, inflation is more than triple what it was back then and not to mention we're still in a supply chain crunch.

With Interests rates and inflation only going higher and recession closing by the market could still crash another 20% and still be overvalued. **BUT** and this is a big but, it still makes sense to buy solid blue chip stocks even in this market. 

MSFT, GOOG, AAPL, AMZN are all great stocks that can wither a recession and potentially even grow in it so DCA into blue chip stocks is always a good choice in a long term perspective and so it only makes sense to keep buying the dip because chances like these are far and few in between.

Edit: using historical data isn't always accurate but it's just gives a perspective to look at a situation I'm not trying call a bottom or anything.

Tldr: even if market conditions suck it still makes sense to buy the dip and DCA",595,154,Giant_leaps,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/vab2kv/spy_is_still_21_above_prepandemic_highs/,vab2kv
