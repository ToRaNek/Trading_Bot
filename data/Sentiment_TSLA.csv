It stalled at resistance, then faded back into its box… but it’s still holding the high ground. That’s how leaders behave before the next leg, if we get confirmation.

September = creek crossed (broke the big range). Since then = BUEC (Back-Up to the Edge of the Creek), re-accumulation around $442-$465. Pullbacks lighter vol, pushes heavier vol = absorption.

Possible paths:

**Base case** (while $440 holds): Sign of Strength through $465-$468 on &gt;100M shares -&gt; $490-$495, stretch $505-$515.

**Spring**: quick dip $436-$440, snap reclaim next day -&gt; best long (add when it re-enters the box).

**Distribution** (lower prob right now): close &lt; $440 w/ rising supply -&gt; $430, then $418-$420.

**Catalysts that can light the fuse**

Robotaxi: driverless Austin expansion; first approvals in NV/AZ/FL; new metros.

FSD v14.x: “reasoning” + stability -&gt; higher subs/attach.

AI5 chip / Samsung+TSMC foundry milestones.

Energy: Megapack/Megablock orders, Powerwall demand.

Any two of the above + price &gt; $468 = likely go time.

2025-11-03 16:21:23,r/stocks,NVDA and AMZN are in the spotlight again. Trump’s new AI chip stance might explain why,"$NVDA and $AMZN have been dominating the headlines this week, and it’s not hard to see why. Trump just said that Nvidia’s most advanced AI chips will be reserved exclusively for U.S. companies, keeping them out of China and potentially other countries. The move could reshape how AI infrastructure develops globally, and investors seem to be pricing in the implications fast.

It’s a huge statement not just for Nvidia but for any tech firm tied to cloud, AI, or chip supply chains. $AMZN, being heavily invested in AI infrastructure through AWS, could indirectly benefit from this tighter export control since U.S. cloud providers might now have a competitive edge in accessing top-tier Nvidia hardware.

As expected, NVDA’s intraday swings have been intense. While tracking its movements, I’ve also been through Bitget’s “Stock Futures Rush” event. They’re currently running a $250,000 pool in tokenized $TSLA shares for active stock futures traders. I’ve been testing out pairs like NVDAUSDT and TSLAUSDT there.. mostly to see how tokenized stock futures behave around news-driven volatility like this. Liquidity and execution have been smoother than I expected, especially considering how new this market still is.

I’m still on the fence about how far tokenized equities will go, but it’s been interesting to see crypto-native platforms trying to mirror real equity sentiment in real time. The overlap between traditional stock news (like Trump’s AI policy) and tokenized market reactions is becoming more noticeable.

Anyone else here has tried trading tokenized stock futures or sees potential in these crossover markets. Do you think restrictions like this could actually strengthen U.S.-based AI firms long-term, or will they just push China to double down on domestic chip development?",69,27,Super_College100,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1onek60/nvda_and_amzn_are_in_the_spotlight_again_trumps/,1onek60

2025-10-21 22:07:14,r/TSLA,TSLA Q3’25 earnings preview (what I’m watching):,"We already got the delivery/energy card: 497k deliveries vs 447k production (huge inventory draw) and a record 12.5 GWh of storage deployments. That sets up a top-line beat QoQ and, more importantly, a nice pop in operating cash flow because they shipped way more than they built. Mix is heavy Model Y/3, so I’m expecting auto ASPs flattish to slightly up from Q2 as incentives were pulled back late in the quarter, with fixed-cost absorption helping gross margin. Offsets: tariffs stepped up (management warned Q2 that the full cost rolls through subsequent quarters) and regulatory credit sales should be lower after the policy changes. Net-net, I’m looking for GM to tick up from Q2’s 17.2% into the high-17s/low-18s, op margin low-single digits, and FCF materially better vs Q2 on that inventory release.

The narrative on the call will matter more than the print. Expect them to label Q3’s record as partly a pull-forward ahead of incentive changes in the U.S., so Q4 guide could be soft on units while they ramp the lower-cost trims and manage tariff headwinds. The bull fuel is all platform: updates on robotaxi (Austin paid miles, safety/intervention rates, next cities), FSD subs (penetration step-up since v12/13), and AI6 (Samsung Texas fab timing, perf/watt vs current HW). On robots, listen for Optimus v3 timing (early ’26), factory task-hours, and any external pilot hints. On Energy, that 12.5 GWh should translate to stronger GP, would love to hear cadence on U.S. LFP cell line and Megafactory Houston (’26) to offset tariff friction. OpEx will stay elevated (AI/robotics R&amp;D, depreciation for compute), CapEx still tracking &gt;$9B for the year.

Setup: stock has run into the print, so bar is higher. If we get: (1) margins up sequentially, (2) big FCF from the inventory draw, and (3) credible autonomy/AI6 milestones, the tape probably shrugs off a cautious Q4 unit guide. If margins miss and the guide leans hard into “pull-forward,” expect whipsaw. My checklist: GM ≥ 18%, FCF solidly positive, paid robotaxi miles disclosed, FSD subs penetration higher again, and a clean AI6 timeline. If they hit 3/5, dip gets bought. If they hit all five, we’re talking next leg toward $470–$500 as the platform story tightens. These are my best guesses, and obviously, things might just play out very differently, but this is my best shot.

2025-10-16 22:22:00,r/stocks,TSLA short thesis from 6 months ago - but now,"No offense to OP here but 6 months ago during the TSLA selloff I read a short thesis here. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/s/EsmTLxisl3

Stock price (especially something like TSLA) is wildly different from actual worth. I don't think shorts did very well 6 months back. In my opinion, and I'm just a SWE and not a financial guy, shorting further after 30-50% downturn just doesn't make sense at all. It was emotional. Shorts got rekt. 

Personally I think TSLA is worth $1000 long term (and Tesla is poorly run for sure but it is still much more than just a car company), but $400-500 is just too much now. Musk has finished buying, and SPX has kept going up all while things don't make sense. But now, when the market is actually slowing down and TSLA is close to ATHs again, is when a short thesis could work out.

2025-10-14 06:09:05,r/stocks,$RERE might actually be a better long-term investment than $TSLA… and nobody wants to admit it.,"Yeah, I know. Sacrilege. But hear me out.

Tesla gets worshipped because it sounds like the future robots, AI, Mars, cyberpunk trucks. But when you actually look at the numbers, reality hits different. FSD still isn’t truly autonomous, margins keep shrinking, growth is slowing, and the stock is priced like it’s going to reinvent physics next quarter. It’s become more of a belief system than an investment.

Now look at $RERE. Completely different vibe. No memes. No cult fanbase. No Elon tweets. Just a company quietly executing and making money in a space that almost every tech company needs but nobody talks about: the circular economy.

They’re literally handling trade-ins and recycling for Apple, Huawei, JD, Xiaomi… the entire backend of the device lifecycle. And unlike half the “future tech” companies out there, they’re actually profitable. Revenue up 32% year over year. Operating income flipped from a loss to a solid gain. EPS turned positive. And instead of diluting shareholders, they’re buying back stock. When was the last time Tesla did that?

Here’s the crazy part: Tesla is still promising autonomy. RERE is already using AI (Matrix) to grade and process up to 100k devices a day. Tesla is selling the dream. RERE is shipping results.

But the market doesn’t reward quiet execution. It rewards loud narratives. If RERE were a U.S. company doing this, it would already be a $10B stock. But because it’s Chinese, most investors won’t even open the 10-K.

So the real question is this:
Are people avoiding RERE because the fundamentals are weak?
Or because they’re addicted to hype and can’t see value unless it comes with a flashy story and a billionaire mascot?

To me, this looks like one of those boring compounders that 10x while everyone’s busy arguing about Tesla vs. Nvidia.",0,0,TigerMCU,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o65niu/rere_might_actually_be_a_better_longterm/,1o65niu
2025-10-12 19:02:04,r/stocks,Yahoo Finance says no AI Bubble,"This is from Brian Sozzi, Executive Editor at Yahoo Finance:

Can we stop with all this AI bubble talk, please?

I get it.

Those hunting for a dot-com style stock market explosion want to make names for themselves by predicting a bubble. Who doesn't want the fame and fortune associated with being right in a big way?

Who doesn't want to spend a month reporting on stocks going down 75% because of a freak warning out of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)?

Entire years could be made for content platforms in a week if the stock market were to get blown up because of a Lehman-like meltdown in tech valuations. If you are over the age of 40, you remember the trading screens during the height of the great financial crisis. Massive declines, a full-on sea of red. Every. Single. Day.

But I'm here to say we have to give these AI bubble predictions a rest. Ditto the predictions that we are in a tech bubble. It's just not what's happening out there yet.

First of all, AI is a real technology being deployed in real ways inside of Corporate America.

Second, this technology is requiring more physical assets in the ground, which are being built to support AI's real-world application. What Zach Dell (son of Michael Dell) is working on at startup Base Power (which just raised $1 billion) impressed me this week. It's addressing a key issue: power availability and costs in part because of rising stress on the grid due to AI development.

Next, the spending on AI infrastructure doesn't strike me as reckless.

I talk to CFOs and they walk me through their thinking, which seems logical. They aren't foaming at the mouth with wild-eyed predictions of grandeur similar to the late '90s.

Plus, the tech giants making the biggest AI investments are fueling their ambitions with cash on hand; not loading up balance sheets with debt. The upstarts in AI are well funded, not being 100% stupid in their organizational build-outs. They're working on tangible technology that has actual orders behind it.

""I would say that's probably thinking too small,"" AMD (AMD) CEO Lisa Su told me about concerns of AI overspending this week. ""You have to really look at what the power of this technology can do for the world.""

AMD is ""investing at the right pace because we want to accelerate ... this is a place where [and] when companies and partners make bold moves, it will be rewarded.""

Who am I to argue with Su, who may go down as one of the best tech CEOs of all time? What she has done at AMD since joining in 2012 is mind-blowing.

Lastly, let's talk about AI worrywarts' warning calls about valuations.

According to new research out of Goldman Sachs this week, the median forward P/E ratio across the ""Magnificent Seven"" is 27 times, or 26 times if excluding Tesla (TSLA), which has a much higher multiple than the other companies. This is roughly half the equivalent valuation of the biggest seven companies in the late 1990s, and the dominant companies in Japan (mostly banks) traded at higher valuations still.

What's more, the current enterprise-to-sales ratios are also much lower than those of the dominant companies in the late 1990s.

""So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,"" said Goldman Sachs strategist Peter Oppenheimer.

One table (Exhibits 7) shows the current “Magnificent 7” (AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, TSLA) trading around **23× forward P/E**, while the 2000 tech leaders were at **52×**. 

Another table (Exhibits 8) points out they’re way more profitable and have cleaner balance sheets (ROE about 44% vs 28% back then, and most of them sit on net cash).

William Blair’s Jed Dorsheimer now projects 480,000 vehicles, up from 437,000 and well above Wall Street’s 443,000 consensus. The increase is tied to strong U.S. demand, a rebound in China, and a pull-forward of buyers ahead of expiring EV tax credits.  
  
At the same time, Elon Musk purchased $1 billion worth of Tesla stock and the company announced an expansion of its Robotaxi program. These developments have fueled renewed bullish sentiment around the stock.  
  
That said, not everything points up. Analysts caution that Q4 margins may face pressure as delivery growth slows and revenue from regulatory credits declines. Tesla also trades at a steep valuation, around 118× projected 2026 EBITDA, compared to the 20–25× range of most tech peers. Risks remain in the form of strong Chinese EV competition, Tesla’s reliance on China, and the “key-man risk” linked to Musk.

2025-09-23 21:28:38,r/TSLA,What do you think of Elon's 2025 CEO Performance Award?,"First let me say that I 100% agree that Elon should get paid for all that he's done to get Tesla to where it is today, including restoring his 2018 pay package. However when I look at the benchmarks for the 2025 CEO Performance Award, it seems as though some of the benchmarks aren't as challenging as they should be to justify a $1 trillion payout after 10 years. For example…

* Deliver 20 million vehicles cumulatively - Tesla has already delivered 7.6 million vehicles and currently delivers 1.79 million annually. If sales remained flat, they'll hit 20 million in just under 7 years. (Remember when [Elon predicted 20 million cars per year](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1310486616075579393)?)
* 1 million Robotaxis deployed - Tesla could ""flip a switch"" and allow car owners to add their cars to the network and easily hit 1 million Robotaxis deployed. The thing is unless people actually ride in them, having a million Robotaxis deployed doesn't materially impact revenues. A better metric would be ""X paid Robotaxi rides per day without a safety monitor.""
* 1 million bots delivered - Since ""bots"" is defined as a Tesla-manufactured physical product with mobility that uses AI, it doesn't have to be 1 million Optimus robots. A smaller, cheaper, task-specific robot would qualify too. In addition, bots used by Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company, etc. could be counted as ""delivered.""
* 10 million FSD subscriptions - Tesla is currently at about 3 million subscriptions. I'd expect this to grow on its own as features improve and the number of cars on the road increases, but all Tesla would need to do is drop the price of the subscription if it looks like the 10 million subscription target is in jeopardy.

- If orange man dies, Vance becomes president. This propels PLTR to be the president’s stock, just as TSLA was at the beginning of this presidency. Tesla kept going up, until tensions between trump and musk were getting bad.

Current options metrics show Tesla’s volume ratio at 0.61, suggesting more call options than puts are being traded. The implied volatility stands at 44.88%, above the historic volatility of 40.95%.

&gt;Johnson’s analysis referenced trading data showing Tesla’s stock price movement from approximately $160 to peaks near $480, with recent stabilization around $320-350. The company maintains a market cap of $1.05 trillion with a price to earnings ratio of 193.51.

2025-08-11 00:45:51,r/stocks,CENTENE (CNC) is a good long term opportunity at this level,"Like every self-respecting Value investor, I've been looking for opportunities to divest from my tech-heavy portfolio. AI Stocks like NVDA, PLTR, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA have done great, but some of these valuations just don't make sense and I don't think now is a good time to buy into them anymore.

That brings me to look for other opportunities. I don't think there's a better opportunity right now than the Healthcare sector.

Historically, Healthcare has outperformed the S&amp;P, thanks to relatively stable stocks like CNC.

Let's take a step back. What the f\*%# happened to this stock in the past 2 months ?

They came out and :

1. Said that their Medical Loss Ratio(MLR) will be much higher because claims are getting expensive
2. Pulled guidance for 2025

Since then, they've had their Q2 Earnings call. They've revised guidance to a EPS of 1.75 for 2025 (from 7.5 previously, ouch). Given that their Q1 2025 EPS was 2.9, and their Q2 EPS was -0.16, this is pricing in a combined -1$ EPS for Q3 and Q4.

The bar is very low. Even a small sign of life from the CEO, could send this stock easily back to the 40 - 50 range, as a path to profitability is starting to be priced into the stock.

The recent headwind, albeit very impactful in the short to medium-term, is temporary. the CEO has said that they have already completed rate re-filings in the 29 states by now, and that the rate decision for each states will be expected in September. The new rates that determine the amount of premiums received, will take into account the high cost for behavioral health(therapists, psychiatric meds etc...),  home health services, and expensive drugs (Wegovy, Ozempic...) .

Compared to the giant UNH, CNC has a much better reputation, isn't under DOJ Investigation, and Ambetter, their Health Insurance Marketplace, has a claims denial rate of 14%, more than half that of UNH.

# Path back to profitability :

CEO and the team are now laser focused on restoring profitability by pulling the necessary levers :

\- identifying and reducing areas where claims have been too ""costly""

\- increasing premium rates, to account for the challenging environment, and with a worst case scenario in mind (continued high morbidity and utilization rate)

\- hinting at a stock buyback in the Earnings call

\- Immune from tariff BS and TACO

# Possible risks

\- The trend of high morbidity and drug use continues to escalate, leading to more people needing expensive surgeries and drugs ==&gt; unlikely, as people who fear that their benefits are being taken away with OBBBA, have already stocked up on drugs/done surgeries

\- continued political pressure on healthcare costs with bills like the OBBBA ==&gt; unlikely, as this bill seems to be a one-and-done on healthcare, and now the Administration will focus on other more pressing matters (Russia - Ukraine conflict, Inflation, crypto, tax bills for the rich etc ...).

Also, this is speculation, but I think the full impact of the OBBBA are wayyy overstated. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that by 2034, 16 million people will lose coverage, but that's a decade away. This will be accounted for in the rate re-pricing.

\- Risks of people changing Insurers because of higher rates ==&gt; given that every Health insurer will be increasing rates, among them: Elevance, UNH, Molina, Blue Cross Blue Shield, CNC will be no exception. People won't switch because none of the other options are better. Centene's health plan is pretty competitive, and compared to Molina health who's the most affordable, Centene's has much better coverage(available across 29 states vs 8 for Molina)

Overall, I think this is a compelling buy, not just for CNC, but for the Health care sector overall, as the benefits greatly outweigh the risk at this point. Historically, the Healthcare Sector has outperformed the S&amp;P, and this is the perfect time to buy in.",45,25,PleasantAnomaly,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mmwihz/centene_cnc_is_a_good_long_term_opportunity_at/,1mmwihz

Khosrowshahi on Wednesday pitched the tie-ups as part of a larger plan that involves three robotaxi business models: paying partners that own such vehicles a fixed rate, sharing revenue with fleet operators and owning vehicles while licensing software for self-driving technology.


""We are talking to private equity players, we have talked to banks,"" the CEO said. ""Once we prove the revenue model, how much these cars can generate on a per day basis, there will be plenty of financing to go around.""
For now, Uber said it was planning on using a ""modest"" portion of its around $7 billion in annual cash flows to fund deployments. It might also sell minority stakes in companies to aid the expansion, it said.


Analysts have said that mass robotaxi deployment could lower driver-reliant Uber's operating costs and boost profitability.
The company has been offering Waymo robotaxis on its ride-hailing app in Austin, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia. In April, Uber entered a deal with Volkswagen for thousands of autonomous electric vans in the United States over the next decade.

2025-07-24 20:28:20,r/stocks,Tesla’s stock plunges 9% after another weak quarter for auto sales,"Tesla shares fell 9% Thursday after the company reported a second straight quarter of declining auto sales, and CEO Elon Musk told analysts that there could be a “few rough quarters” ahead due to the expiration of federal electric vehicle tax credits.

Musk’s EV maker reported a 16% decline in automotive revenue from a year earlier to $16.7 billion. Total revenue fell 12% to $22.5 billion from $25.5 billion a year earlier, missing the average analyst estimate of $22.74 billion, according to LSEG.

Tesla has been facing rising competition in key markets like China and Europe, especially from lower cost Chinese EV players. In early July, Tesla reported a 14% year-over-year slide in vehicle deliveries to 384,000 for the second quarter. 

And in Europe, Tesla’s new car registrations declined last month, according to data released Thursday from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association.

Tesla shares have been hammered this year, with the stock down 25% in 2025, by far the worst performer among tech’s megacaps.

On Wednesday’s earnings call, Musk and CFO Vaibhav Taneja said that the “big beautiful bill” recently passed by Congress would affect Tesla’s business. The bill ends a federal $7,500 EV tax credit at the end of September.

Along with the struggles in Tesla’s core auto business, Musk’s own political activity has been in focus. 

The world’s richest person led President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), slashing the size of the federal government and regulatory agencies that oversee his companies. He also endorsed Germany’s extreme anti-immigrant AfD party.

In recent months, Musk and Trump have clashed over the president’s spending bill, and Musk recently said he’s forming his own political party.

Tesla investors have been eagerly waiting for the company to release a cheaper EV model to refresh the aging lineup and perhaps reinvigorate sales. Tesla management said it started limited production of the more affordable model in June and expects to ramp it up in the second half of the year.

Still, the outlook for the rest of the year remains murky as Tesla didn’t provide any official guidance, a departure from earlier this year, when the company said growth would return in 2025.

“Management initially guided for deliveries growth in 2025,” Seth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar, said in a note on Wednesday. “We interpret no guidance as a signal that management is no longer forecasting volume growth. This aligns with our expectation for deliveries to decline in 2025.”

2025-07-10 15:13:28,r/stocks,Trump Just Dropped The 50% ‘Copper Tariff Bomb’ - What Does This Mean For The Stock Market?,"That's right ...Trump just announced that he will impose a 50% tariff on copper, effective August 1, 2025, citing a “national security assessment.”

In his statement, he bombastically emphasized the importance of copper to the country: copper is the second most used material in the Department of Defense. How can we let ‘sleepy leaders’ destroy this industry? It's time to rebuild America's copper industry. This is our golden age!

What this means for the market (personal opinion): Copper prices could be about to spike (again) Copper (HG=F) has bounced around $4.50/lb last week. Once the tariffs hit the ground, expect importers to stock up ahead of time and copper mining stocks to put in a rally. Focus: Freeport-McMoRan ($FCX), Southern Copper ($SCCO), Teck ($TECK), as well as small-caps Taseko ($TGB), Copper Mountain ($CPPMF).

Risk of rising short-term inflationary pressures 

Copper is widely used in construction, data centers, electric vehicles, power grids, and defense.

50% tariffs = higher costs = could push up cost transmission effects in industrial and tech supply chains.

New energy, EV sectors could be under pressure 

Tesla ($TSLA), Enphase ($ENPH), Azure ($NIO), etc. could face higher raw material costs.

Energy storage and battery businesses will have their margins squeezed if they haven't hedged copper prices in advance.

Defense contractors may be forced to strain 

RTX, LMT, NOC, and others rely on copper for radar, missile, and flight systems.

With tariffs raising domestic copper prices, these companies may either lobby the government or turn to local supply chains.

My personal view: 

Short term? Bullish on copper mining stocks, bearish on rising manufacturing costs 

Medium term? Watch inflation and Fed policy feedback 

Long term? This is clearly a big election year move, with lots of policy variables and no shortage of volatility

Incidentally: if copper prices continue to rise, it may be harder for the Fed to cut rates as a result - a potential impact variable for the stock market as a whole.

Would also like to hear your thoughts: 

Do you think this is a pre-election bluff? Or will Congress really follow through?

Has anyone started laying out copper futures or options yet?

Is this just short term volatility or the beginning of a major style switch in industrial stocks? Not investment advice.

2025-07-01 05:48:19,r/stocks,"As a long term investor, how to strategize my exit plan (when to sell)?","I know when a company is at a bargain to buy. Problem is, I know when to buy, but I don’t know when to sell. Do I sell when I need the money or when doctor tells me I only got a month to live? 

Let me give you several examples:

I was able to buy lots of Celsius stocks at $8 basis in 2020 when I began trying their drinks, enjoyed it and began seeing Celsius drinks sold everywhere at grocery markets and convenience stores. I felt confident. Celsius rose all the way to $95, the stock split and dropped all the way back to $25. Obviously, I did not sell any.

Same thing applies to FSLY, SQ, SE when I did not sell at the peak and watched them drop all the way back to my entry price then I panic sold and only secured a very little gain.

SMCI - I also panic sold at $23.81 for small gain and obviously, watching the price going back up is lots of pain. 

I was able to buy lots of crowdstrike last year in July when the outage caused chaos within airport and various companies. I also scooped some UNH as well due to recent (to me, it’s overreaction) free fall. 

I bought lots of ASTS at $11 and sold at $30 to get my entry money back. Then it went all the way to $46. 

Lots of people say, if a stock gives you 25% to 50%, it makes sense for you to sell all, take the profit and run. It’s not true at all. If you sold NVDA, TSLA, AMD and PLTR at 30% gain, you probably cried yourself to sleep every night. Some of the companies do have ten-fold potential if you decide to hold long. And selling them also subject yourself to short term capital gain tax. 

Also, PLTR PE ratio skyrockets. I understand military contract and AI reliance are legit, but there’s no guarantee for price to hold. When is a good time to sell? Which companies have bright future to hold strong despite free fall? Nobody has a crystal ball I understand but does reading business financial statement and learning their fundamental/ business model/ ecological system gives you a clue? 

Market is at ATH carried by major techs due to AI replacing humans leading to boost in company’s profit margin and future earning potential. But correction will eventually come.

2025-06-27 19:04:50,r/stocks,Trump Announces Mineral Rights Deal With Congo What does this mean for the stock market?,"Just saw the big news: Trump brokered a mineral deal between the U.S. and the DRC that will give U.S. firms access to key minerals such as cobalt, tantalum, lithium, and copper in exchange for U.S. support for the Congo-Rwanda peace deal 

This looks like more than just geopolitical maneuvering, it could have long-term implications for the stock market and certain stocks.

Brief summary

The U.S., pushed by Trump, brokered a peace deal between Congo and Rwanda and signed a multi-billion dollar “minerals for security” agreement.

Trump's allies and private companies (including Massad Boulos) plan to invest over $500 million to build a smelter there, with the goal of moving away from dependence on the Chinese mineral chain.

Why this deserves investor attention

KEY MINERALS, STRATEGIC MATERIALS 

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) controls roughly 70 percent of the world's cobalt and 60 percent of its tantalum reserves-metals widely used in electric car batteries, chips, electronics, and military technology.

If the U.S. can establish its own supply chain, the global industrial landscape could be rewritten.

Capital Flows Could Change 

If U.S. miners and tech companies get in first, companies like Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), Albemarle (ALB), or lithium material companies like Livent (LTHM) could be the winners.

 Geo Risks vs Market Opportunities 

The Congo situation remains complex - if a peace deal stands, commodity prices could stabilize and U.S. firms may be able to gain control of resources in the long term; conversely, a short-term landmine.

Impact on Tech &amp; EV Sectors 

OEMs such as Tesla and the battery chain (e.g., NVDA, TSLA, BATT-type ETFs) could benefit if cobalt and lithium supplies become more stable and EV production costs fall.

CURRENT MARKET REACTION: 

Global mining stocks rallied in the early stages of the peace deal rumors, but then retreated as details of the deal remain unclear

Market Sentiment: cautiously optimistic and bullish in the long term, but short-term uncertainties remain (situation, implementation, opposition factions, etc.)

My recommendations from an investment perspective

Long-term Layout Focus on resource stocks (e.g. ALB, FCX) - once the agreement is implemented, it is a probable event for US companies to acquire substantial mineral resources.

Medium-term ideas Tracking battery, electric vehicle sector - if the cost of raw materials downward, vehicle margins and growth logic benefit.

Short-term operation Pay attention to the progress of events - the peace agreement is unstable and may be repeated; if you intervene, you can add a stop loss or hedge.

Macro observation If the United States to “resource diplomacy” as a means of follow-up in Greenland, Ukraine and other places may also have similar operations.

Some of my questions

Has anyone been following cobalt or lithium resource stocks? Any early layouts for this wave?

Do you think this peace deal is sustainable, or is it just a “paper peace”?

Bigger question: does this mean that China is loosening its grip on key minerals?",120,67,mattishannon,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1llz7l5/trump_announces_mineral_rights_deal_with_congo/,1llz7l5
2025-06-27 15:43:58,r/stocks,"Trump: US-China Trade Framework ""Signed""  Rare Earths Deal, Tariffs Rollback in Motion","Trump just said that the U.S. and China “signed” a framework deal on tariffs and trade. This follows the informal understanding they reached in Geneva back in May

Key points:

China confirmed both sides have finalized details of the framework

China will resume rare earth exports to the U.S

In return, the U.S. will remove countermeasures (probably the steep retaliatory tariffs).

Commerce Secretary Lutnick says 10 more trade deals are close mentions Canada, Japan, etc

Treasury Sec. Bessent says they want to wrap up trade talks by Labor Day (Sept 1)

The July 9 tariff deadline might get pushed back if talks show “good faith.”

Trump already sealed a deal with the UK; the EU is next, but tensions are high (threats of 50% tariffs on EU goods )

Stephen Miran (White House economic adviser) also said we may not see tariffs go below 10% long-term, but some countries could get better rates depending on how talks go

My take: This could be bullish for sectors exposed to China or dependent on rare earths (think EVs, semis, clean energy). If tariffs ease, expect to see some relief rallies across the board

[**NKE (Nike)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&amp;p=d)\-Reported EPS of $0.14 vs. $0.13 expected; revenue of $11.1B vs. $10.72B expected. Despite the miss on earnings, the NKE CEO expressed cautious optimism, stating that while improvements are expected, a full recovery remains distant (mainly due to tariffs which he said would have a $1B impact). Also forecasted \~5% Q1 sales decline, a better outlook than the 7% drop forecasted. Interested in seeing if this breaks $70 today. Sportswear and LULU have been inconsistent in recovery from tariffs, interested to see if LULU moves (and has potentially recovery) from this.

The administration will release an ""AI Action Plan"" on July 23. These measures aim to address grid congestion, permitting delays, by declaring a national energy emergency. I'm seeing OKLO move off this but I'm interested other nuclear energy stocks as well. OKLO failed to break $60 in premarket but interested in watching further.

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)\-NVDA hit an all-time high along with the market, as the U.S. and China agreed on a trade framework and Iran/Israel tensions de-escalated. Momentum has continued as macro fears (mainly from Israel/Iran) die down and AI infrastructure investment remains elevated (CRWV acquiring CORZ). Interested in seeing if NVDA can hold above prior day's low ($153.49), momentum is pretty sustained and the move can continue far longer than anyone can expect. Since the trade framework with China was agreed upon, the next catalyst I'm potentially interested in is lifting of chip restrictions in China.

2025-06-25 14:40:36,r/stocks,OpenAI’s Self-Driving Ambitions (with TSLA and GOOG),"&gt;The artificial intelligence company has set many challenging goals. Autonomous vehicle software is now among them - but may pit the company against Tesla.

&gt;

&gt;Sam Altman has made many big claims about what OpenAI will be able to do, including spearheading ultra-expansive data centers and building artificial intelligence that can rival the abilities of Ph.D. holders.

&gt;But he also recently made a significant, yet largely overlooked, assertion. OpenAI is seeking to crack the code for advanced autonomous driving.

&gt;“We have some new technology that could just do self-driving for standard cars way better than any current approach has worked,” Altman said last week on the “Uncapped With Jack Altman” podcast, which his brother hosts. Altman added, “If our A.I. techniques can really go drive a car, that’s pretty cool.”

&gt;The technology is in its early stages - DealBook hears that it involves both OpenAI’s Sora video software and its robotics team - but commercializing it is still a distant goal. An OpenAI spokesman declined to comment.

&gt;That could make Altman even more of a competitor to Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but has since waged war on the company. (A short reminder: Musk has sued to try to stop OpenAI from revamping its corporate structure, and he’s building a direct competitor, xAI, that’s raising - and spending - billions of dollars.)

&gt;Autonomous vehicles are key to Musk’s vision for Tesla, which he increasingly sees as the producer of huge fleets of fully self-driving cars. Tesla is focusing on A.I.-powered vision rather than on the array of sensors like lidar that Waymo, a Google spinoff, uses.

&gt;One big question mark for OpenAI: Where will its systems get their data? Tesla and Waymo have already amassed huge amounts of information and video through their years of driving on the roads.

&gt;That raises the question of whether OpenAI believes in a fundamentally different approach to self-driving tech, one that relies less on real-world data and more on advanced simulation, synthetic data or a breakthrough in “generalizable” A.I. Of note: The company recently collaborated with Applied Intuition, a start-up focused on putting A.I. in cars.

&gt;(OpenAI’s venture arm also invested in Ghost Autonomy, a self-driving start-up, though the business folded last year.)

&gt;“I think he really gets it,” Altman said of President Trump’s approach to A.I. (Altman has forged close ties to the president, including by donating to his inauguration fund and announcing the Stargate data center project at the White House.) “I think he really understands the importance of leadership in this technology.”

&gt;Altman was uncertain about whether the right A.I. regulations would come to pass: “I have become a bit more, jaded isn’t the right word, but it’s something in that direction, about the ability of policymakers to grapple with the speed of technology.”

&gt;Altman played down reports of tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft as they rework their relationship: “Do you believe that, when you read those things?”

2025-06-24 19:28:25,r/stocks,TSLA has been a terrible buy and hold,"From 1/4/2021 to 6/23/25 TSLA has gone up 43.34%

In the same time frame, MSFT (+123.25%), GOOGL (+91.39%), META (+159.74%), NFLX (139.75%), AAPL (+55.71%), S&amp;P (+62.81%), and QQQ (+71.88%) have all outperformed. 

The only Mag 7 stock to not outperform TSLA has been AMZN (+30.84%).

What’s crazier still is that none of these numbers include dividends.

Also, as a side note: what’s even crazier still is that I looked at a forgotten about legacy company called General Electric. They are up a whopping 374.46% over the same time frame not including their dividend.

I would say the only redeeming quality of TSLA is that in this 4.5 year frame their PE ratio has dropped from ~1100 to 200. This just goes to show how much valuation and time matter. A great company can have a wildly inaccurate price and you are left with nothing while it grows into its valuation.

Also worth noting their revenue has been completely flat since reporting Q2 of 2023 while gross profit has fallen by ~20%. Their net earnings per share has collapsed 50% during this time.

Lots of the last 2 years have been when Musk was involved with his politics. Maybe he can turn it around now, but either way, the current valuation does not leave much room for any sort of stock price appreciation.

Today is mainly second-day movers from news yesterday.

News: [Iran Israel War Updates](https://apnews.com/live/iran-israel-war-updates-6-24-2025)

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d)\- NHTSA pressed Tesla for more information after robotaxi incidents caught on camera showed lane departures and speeding in Austin (this hasn't actually moved the stock but interesting to see how this ultimately plays out). TSLA surged massively yesterday (325-&gt;359) because of the robotaxi launch on Sunday, and streamers caught some traffic violations. Most obvious catalyst here is if regulators pull Robotaxi out of Austin, but I doubt that will happen. Also interseted to see if we move up for a second day. 

[**USO (United States Oil Fund)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=USO&amp;p=d)/[**XLE (Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=XLE&amp;p=d)\-President Trump accused both Israel and Iran of violating a ceasefire he helped broker yesterday. We saw the market move up yesterday (and oil fall) due to Trump saying that the Israel and Iran conflict was set to end in a ceasefire. This may be a telegraphed move to say that the ceasefire might not hold. If so then we may see a surge in oil if the conflict continues and the market fall. Overall I'm mainly interested in the moves of oil because this actually hasn't budged VIX too much. 

[**CRCL (Circle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&amp;p=d)\-Crypto “rules of the road” framework unveiled by Senators. The bipartisan GENIUS Act passed the Senate 68–30 to regulate stableCs. CRCL moved up to $299 yesterday and then sell off after a MASSIVE move since the IPO- I think that the selloff from the move was saved primarily due to Trump's announcement of the Iran/Israel ceasefire (which caused the entire market to move up). We might see another selloff today- still short biased in this and not interested in this long. 

Random risks I'm thinking of that could kill momentum: The bill now has to pass the House; dilution by the STABLE Act could change issuer oversight, and international competition (Tether) could beat this in the longrun. 

[**NTRS (Northern Trust Corp)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NTRS&amp;p=d)\-Northern Trust shares surged Friday \~8% after reports that Bank of New York Mellon approached the company about a potential merger. Overall wasn't an extremely interesting catalyst but NTRS said they're committed to remaining independent, so we may see additional updates on this. (Most companies that are committed to remaining independent are holding out for a higher buyout price).

2025-06-23 22:26:46,r/stocks,Tesla Robotaxi goes live  stock rockets TSLA will continue to rise   or is it going cold?,"Fellow TSLA observers, checking in  As you may have seen  Tesla made big news recently: self-driving cabs (Robotaxi) officially went live in Austin charging only $4.20 per order (yup  Musk is playing the game again) 

On June 23rd, Tesla launched a trial run of Robotaxi in Austin  Texas Pricing is $4.20 per order  and it still has a human safety officer sitting in the car  but it has already begun to pay for external operations News As soon as the news came out Tesla stock spiked 8-10% straight up in pre-market to close near $348-$350 for the day 

Is TSLA up or down?

So far: TSLA is still running high  shares around $349. 8%+ one-day spike after Robotaxi

Year-to-date: while cumulative year-to-date is still in the -7% to -14% range (depending on where you start)  shares have rallied 35-40% since Robotaxi news

Reasons for the rally: 

Significant inflection point: this is the first step in making real money from Autopilot  This is the first step for autonomous driving to start making real money  there are still safeties, but this is a major breakthrough 

Valuation: UBS raised their price target from $190 to $215 (though still cautious) Cathie Wood continues to be bullish as well 

Macro-help: the Fed has become more dovish, and the overall broader market is optimistic  which also gives room for the rally to continue



Will it continue to rise or will it be prototyped?

Has the positive sentiment been overdrawn? UBS thinks Robotaxi's upside may have factored in a \~$99 share price premium 

Regulatory risk: Texas has made it clear that licenses are required by September, and there have already been some fines for non-compliance 

Musk risk: public opinion swirls  protesters  and political pressures are all over the place Investors can easily get scared 

Valuation is still expensive: even if it's profitable now, TSLA is still trading at a valuation of 170x 2025 expected profits. It's already outrageous 

TSLA is currently trading around $349 with intraday volume of \~176 million shares The trading range of $323-$357.5 is approaching the technical pressure level of $360-$370 

In a nutshell: the launch of Robotaxi is indeed a big positive The stock has surged by about 8-10%  Currently oscillating at $349 but a lot of the good has already been reflected 

Long view: this is a real turning point  Revenue modeling, branding, voice, and execution are all perfect scores  If technology and regulation keep up  it could continue to fly

Short view: valuation is too high  public opinion is too risky, and policy is too unstable  so it's not uncommon for the market to sell the news at any time  so it's not uncommon to see the market go higher



Do you think Robotaxi is a real long term change or a short term hype?

* **Inflation** has not hit the economy yet, but this weeks earnings will start showing hints of it.
* Inflation if not controlled can impact **liquidity** (can impact 401k contributions, DCA contributions etc...)
* **War is never cheap** and thought it can give short term bursts of boosts to stock markets with rumors.
* **Debt** is good until it is within means - i.e. Debt &lt; GDP
* **Risk fatigue is real** \- Your month on month contributions are being blindly invested in those target funds without risk readings taken into considerations and rug pulls are not uncommon.
* **AI bubble** is similar to the dot com bubble - those who know it, know it that dot com investments went beyond the realistic capabilities that were not realized until 10-15 years down the line but by then the bubble burst and took 10-12 years to recover.

Solar stocks such as Sunrun (RUN), SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) and First Solar (FSLR) plunged overnight after the newly released Senate budget bill would keep a full phase-out of solar and wind energy tax credits by 2028.

There's a lot on the domestic calendar this week. But investors and the world are watching global affairs, too.

Meanwhile, several market-driving events are due in the coming days. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, consumer spending data, and possible news on President Donald Trump's tariffs headline the week. Thursday's Juneteenth holiday will mean a break from trading.

The Fed will hand down another decision on interest rates this week, with a decision scheduled for Wednesday. The coming weekend could see Tesla providing a significant update on the direction of the electric vehicle maker.

Did consumers in May continue to prop up the economy? Tuesday's U.S. retail sales will make it clear whether strong spending levels continued, while housing construction data will provide insight into whether builders are catching up with lagging inventory levels. Investors will continue to watch for trade developments as negotiations continue between U.S. officials and key trading partners.

It’s a light week for corporate earnings, highlighted by expected reports from homebuilder Lennar, accounting firm Accenture, grocery chain Kroger, and online used car seller CarMax.

# Fed Interest-Rate Decision Comes Amid Increasing Pressure for Cuts

Fed officials have said they are keeping rates steady amid a strong labor market as they monitor inflation data for signs that Trump’s tariffs are driving up prices.

But the pressure is on the Federal Reserve after May inflation data came in lower than economists expected. Despite comments from President Donald Trump urging the Fed to make a one-point cut, investors don't expect the central bank to take action when its two-day meeting concludes on Wednesday.

The CME FedWatch Tool, which measures fed funds futures to determine the path of interest rates, indicates that traders overwhelmingly believe that Fed will keep rates at their current levels in June. They also don't expect the central bank to move rates at its late July meeting.

After the meeting concludes on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will provide more insight into the central bank’s view on the economy and interest rates when he takes media questions.

On Tuesday, retail sales figures from May will provide another barometer of the economy's health Consumer spending makes up about two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, housing data will also be scrutinized as affordability issues continue to depress home sales. The latest homebuilder confidence reading on Tuesday will show if construction industry officials see improvements coming in the market, while Wednesday’s housing starts data will indicate whether construction levels are rising amid a need for more housing inventory.

# Tesla Robotaxi Rollout Could Come as Early as Sunday

After months of waiting, investors could soon get a key update from electric vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA). CEO Elon Musk said in a recent social media post that the company could roll out its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, as early as Sunday, June 22. ""We are being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift,"" Musk wrote.

The introduction of the company's robotaxi service could be a key moment for Tesla, which is banking on artificial intelligence (AI) and self-driving vehicles to become the transportation technologies of the future. Tesla is well-positioned to lead the market in the emerging technology, analysts have concluded, with Goldman Sachs writing that the EV maker could have a leg up on the competition through its ability to train self-driving through its AI development and to quickly scale production levels of the technology.

Despite a light corporate earnings schedule this week, investors will still get some expected updates from noteworthy companies.

Lennar’s (LEN) expected report after the bell on Monday follows the homebuilder's warning of weakness in the housing market in the prior quarter.  The scheduled Friday reports from accounting firm Accenture (ACN) and online car seller CarMax (KMX) will be posted in the shadow of both companies' lower-than-expected profits in the prior quarter.

2025-06-11 18:36:02,r/stocks,TSLA Shares Rebound as Musk Steps Back from Trump Clash,"So Elon Musk just backed off from his beef with Trump, saying on X that some of his posts went “too far” and he regrets them That’s a pretty big shift after all the drama. Trump, meanwhile, isn’t interested in making up and warned Musk he could face “serious consequences” if he helps Democrats

This whole feud has Wall Street on edge, especially Tesla investors. Tesla’s rollout of its robotaxi service in Austin is supposed to kick off June 22 but there’s worry Trump might use federal regulators to slow things down kind of a political roadblock that could hit Tesla’s growth hard

Tesla shares bounced back almost 2% early Wednesday, recovering some of last week’s losses when the Musk-Trump drama blew up

From an investor’s perspective  how do you see this playing out? Does Musk’s “sorry” move calm the waters enough to keep Tesla on track? Or is the political heat going to keep putting a ceiling on Tesla’s potential?",35,30,leachdogg,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1l8xc08/tsla_shares_rebound_as_musk_steps_back_from_trump/,1l8xc08

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d)\-More easing in Trump/Musk tensions, both have tweeted reconciliatory tweets earlier this morning and it seems their feud is at an end. Trump announced a 'done deal' in the rare earths deal, causing a small spike to the market premarket. The buying opportunity was the day of the tweets but obviously, still interesting to see if the Trump/Musk relationship can be completely repaired. It seems both sides are playing damage control and trying to repair the rift. There's been huge discontent from Musk due to Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" but we've moved from 325-&gt;275 -&gt;335. MASSIVE move and trade of the month.

[**OUST (Ouster)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OUST&amp;p=d)\-Premarket announcement that the US Department of Defense approved its OS1 digital lidar sensor for use in unmanned aerial systems. Most of the move occurred premarket, but will be watching to see if we make another leg higher- the daily chart looks near parabolic if we move up again today/tomorrow with a move from 7.50 to 20 in the past month.

[**CRWV (Coreweave)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&amp;p=d)\- Staying surprisingly resilient at \~$160, we've also seen upward momentum an hour before the open (154-&gt;160). Overall nothing too compelling for a short unless we rocket past 160 to something ludicrous, this has stayed up longer/stronger than CRCL so far more interested in this.

[**ASTS (AST SpaceMobile)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&amp;p=d)\-Somewhat still hovering fairly high from Jeff Bezos posting a picture that implied a partnership. This has diverged from RKLB's move up, and is still hovering around $36. Nothing too compelling unless we make a leg higher. Again, nothing confirmed from Bezos or Amazon, so the move may fade if no formal announcement follows.

2025-06-10 16:45:48,r/stocks,Will robots be the next smartphone?,"Tesla appears to be undervalued given its potential to revolutionize the field of robotics for both business and personal use. Stock prices on Wall Street are based on expectations for the future; we must consider what the robotics world will soon look like.Robots have become an integral part of the automotive and semiconductor industries, but mass-produced autonomous robots could have a significant impact on society and Tesla stock.Despite personal concerns, the arrival of advanced robots seems inevitable and it is worth considering future investment opportunities. 

Will Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) robots be the next smartphone device for the mass market? Will they have the same impact on society as smartphones? In this article, we'll look at the robots Tesla is developing and whether we can profit from this potential shift.

To some extent, Wall Street bases its judgment on future profit expectations for stock prices. When we think about future prospects, we have to think about what the world will look like in 3, 5, or 10 years and what will happen to stock prices? This is obviously a very difficult question to answer, but we can make reasonable predictions about the overall growth of the emerging humanoid robotics industry.

Ignoring the risks posed by AI and robots to the survival of the species, we can probably assume that the short-term risk is that China will continue to dominate Chinese EV sales, and that Tesla could face a very tough time in the Chinese market. However, global sales of electric vehicles continue to grow. However, as EVs continue to grow, Tesla will need something to differentiate itself, and that's where self-driving cars might come into play. I guess we'll see if that will fully materialize, and for now, it looks like advanced testing will take place in Austin, Texas. Let's move on to the next issue.

China has a monopoly on rare earth elements used in Tesla robots and electric cars. The U.S. government needs to break that monopoly by heavily funding domestic resources. According to Reuters, President Trump may be on the verge of passing the Defense Production Act to fund critical and rare earth elements. Of course, we are currently in the midst of various political waves that are clashing between Elon and President Trump. Trying to predict what will happen between the two of them is futile as they are both unknowns, but it's just something to be aware of. Another risk factor is that Tesla currently has a lot of production in China. If relations with the U.S. deteriorate further, there could be repercussions. That's an unknown to keep an eye on.

I think Tesla Robotics as well as solutions from NVIDIA, Amazon and China are on their way and will materialize in the next few years. Regarding the potential market size, according to a Reuters article, NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said, The age of robotics has arrived. People are paying attention. This is likely to be the biggest industry.



So will humanoid robots become as popular as smartphones? I think it's possible, and if we look at how Elon is transforming Optimus Prime in the factory, we'll have a clearer picture of the future in a few years.",0,0,Aluseda,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1l80l6z/will_robots_be_the_next_smartphone/,1l80l6z

News from a tech giant, inflation data and earnings from a meme-stock legend are among the highlights of the week ahead in markets.

Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference opens the week with a keynote session from CEO Tim Cook scheduled for Monday. Cook will likely use the event to address the company's new products, services, and partnerships. GameStop could clarify its cryptocurrency strategy on the company's earnings call, set for Tuesday. Key companies in the growing artificial intelligence (AI) market are also scheduled to update investors on their financials during the week.

A U.S. inflation report scheduled for Wednesday could indicate whether President Donald Trump’s tariffs are beginning to have an effect on the economy. The news follows a healthy jobs report Friday.

After markets shook off trade tensions last week to bring the S&amp;P 500 back above 6000, investors will keep an eye on tariffs as Trump’s deadline on trade deals approaches. At the same time, the Senate will continue to work toward passage of Trump’s “Big, Beautiful” budget bill amid increasing criticism from Tesla CEO and former Department of Government Efficiency Chief Elon Musk.

# Economists Look for Inflation’s Impact in May CPI Report

Wednesday’s expected release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be the first look at inflation from May. With a Federal Reserve meeting around the corner, the report could set the tone for the central bank as it faces pressure from Trump to lower interest rates. Fed officials are in their blackout period ahead of their next two-day meeting, which begins June 17.

Trump’s tariffs will be a key topic in Friday’s consumer sentiment report, which dropped for four straight months before leveling out in May. Consumers are consistently worried that tariffs will drive inflation higher, sending the closely watched survey to some of its lowest readings since the pandemic. As inflation has lately appeared in check, the freefall in sentiment may have hit bottom.

# GameStop Reports As It Jumps into Bitcoin Market

GameStop’s (GME) earnings report comes as the video-game retailer dips its toe in the cryptocurrency pool. The company, which fired up the meme stock craze in 2021 with its meteoric rise, announced in late May that it bought $500 million in bitcoin. With its retail video game business in decline, GameStop looks to emulate the playbook of Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR) and other companies centering their business models on buying bitcoin.

AI will be a key theme in other corporate earnings this week. Oracle’s (ORCL) report on Wednesday follows the January announcement that the database software firm would join ChatGPT maker OpenAI and SoftBank as part of a joint venture known as Stargate to build AI infrastructure. Adobe’s (ADBE) report on Thursday is also expected to focus on the company’s sales of AI-enhanced graphics software.

2025-06-07 17:03:11,r/stocks,My Thesis on TSLA ($295.14) and CRWV ($140.16),"***This is a multi-signal analysis***, built by synthesizing options flow data, sentiment, company fundamentals, and technical structure. I'm focusing on setups where multiple signals converge. Not just one off price moves or just pure TA.

We all know about the Elon Musk vs. Trump drama that's playing out in public. On June 5, $TSLA dropped nearly 14% in a single session. That was its largest one day drop since March 2020.

This wasn’t a move based on earnings or fundamentals. It was event driven and sentiment driven. And it came with record put volume. There were over 4 million contracts traded. This is pointing to either panic hedging or high conviction short bets. That kind of volume typically leads to short term dislocation.

On June 6, TSLA rebounded +3.7%, showing early signs of stabilization. That bounce came on strong volume, which adds weight to the reversion thesis.

**Entry Zone:**  
$285–$288 is a key support zone. A clean hold or reclaim above $300 with volume reactivates the bounce thesis.

**Target Zone:**  
$305–$318, especially if the political overhang fades and sentiment resets.

**Danger Zone:**  
Avoid entries if price retests below $280 without reversal. This could lead to further downside.

Now looking at CoreWeave ($CRWV):

CRWV IPO’d in March and ran from \~$57 (May 13) to \~$163 by June 4. This was a 185% move in just three weeks. That’s a classic parabolic extension.

It pulled back on June 5 to \~$135 and closed June 6 at $140.16. So far, this looks more like the first real cooling off period than a full reversal.

Options flow is mixed. There's still aggressive call activity at $150–$160, but we’re also seeing increasing open interest in the $130 and $120 puts. That split usually signals uncertainty. Some still chasing upside, others starting to hedge or fade.

**Entry Zone:**  
Watching $130–$134. That was prior resistance and could act as support if price compresses there. If it reclaims $145 with strength, the setup for a retest of the highs becomes viable.

**Target Zone:**  
$155–$160, but only if price gets back above $145 on volume.

**Danger Zone:**  
A breakdown below $125 likely triggers a deeper unwind. Watching $114–$118 as the next volume shelf.

**Conclusion:**  
TSLA looks like a higher confidence reversion setup. The size of the flush, the record flow, and the bounce all point to a dislocation that can snap back. CRWV is more speculative. It's a momentum name cooling off after a vertical run. It's tradable, but only with confirmation.

Would love to hear how others are approaching these. Especially if you’re tracking the same flows or setups.

Now everyone’s freaking out. Investors like Ross Gerber are calling it a “disaster,” saying Elon made this mess by getting political in the first place. And let’s be real killing EV tax credits would be a huge blow to Tesla

TSLA bounced a bit on Friday (+3.7%) but it’s still way down from earlier this week. Morgan Stanley is still bullish (lol), $410 price target and all that

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d)\- Elon Musk/Trump were in a public feud/argument on Twitter yesterday, and the threat of TSLA's government contracts being cancelled was brought up by Trump. Looking for the second day trade in this- we saw TSLA go to a low of $275 yesterday, so I'm interested to see if we continue selling off or make at least some attempt at recovery. Trump/Musk are expected to speak today to ""cool things down"". This spat is mainly political, another issue to add along with the rest. Musk did threaten to stop work on the Dragon Capsule, Trump threatened to stop all of TSLA/SpaceX's government contracts, causing the stock to fall 50 points throughout the day.

We had seen VERA actually spike up due to their drug report a few days back from $20 -&gt;$37 on this news- it's possible that it'll just stay flat at pre-drug release price.

[**CRCL (Circle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&amp;p=d)\- Watching the $100 level for potential breakout or breakdown. I regret not writing a DD for this but I was taking a break. We opened at \~2.5x multiple to the original IPO price and surged past $100 briefly in the first few minutes of trading, we've stayed pretty strong/sustained up since then. I'm interested to see if we can stay fairly at this level. I'm mainly interested in this because CRCL is one of the first listed stable C's on a US listing, and we've seen HUGE interest in recent catalysts that are related to this space/industry.

[**ASTS (AST SpaceMobile)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&amp;p=d)\- ASTS surged over 13% amid speculation of a potential partnership or investment from Amazon, following social media posts featuring AST's CEO and Jeff Bezos. AMZN is beginning commercialization of its Project Kuiper initiative, a satellite-based project that will deliver retail wireless broadband to Earth (competitor to Starlink). There was a research report released that speculates ASTS's RF wireless service could complement Kuiper's broadband technology, and therefore make sense for an acquisition by AMZN.

2025-06-05 15:01:00,r/stocks,Tesla stock falls again as Musk's 'KILL the BILL' screed hits Trump tax bill's progress,"No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-falls-again-as-musks-kill-the-bill-screed-hits-trump-tax-bills-progress-121409722.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-falls-again-as-musks-kill-the-bill-screed-hits-trump-tax-bills-progress-121409722.html)

Tesla (TSLA) stock slumped again on Thursday as the fallout continued to emerge from the very public policy blowout between President Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

""Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL,"" Musk posted on X on Wednesday.

Musk added, ""If the massive deficit spending continues, there will only be money for interest payments and nothing else!""

The vocal criticism is irking Trump, the Wall Street Journal reported, with a senior official claiming that White House advisors were ""caught off guard"" by Musk's latest broadsides.

Tesla stock fell solidly on Wednesday and extended those losses in premarket trading on Thursday, down as much as 3%.

The comments come after the one-time leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) waded earnestly into the debate over the bill this week, angrily posting Tuesday that it was a ""disgusting abomination.""

""I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,"" he said.

""Shame on those"" who voted for it in the House, Musk added.

Bloomberg reported that Musk may also be driven by the fact that the federal EV tax credit is being phased out by the bill, as he fought hard to keep it in place as a key driver for Tesla's business.

Musk's barrage comes as the bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate, and a Congressional Budget Office estimation of its impact on the deficit adds fuel to Musk's line of argument.

The nonpartisan office projected the House-passed version of the bill would add $2.4 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years.

The formerly Musk-led DOGE itself has been criticized for not producing the budgetary cuts Musk touted it could find, and the cuts it has produced have been deeply unpopular.

Musk's closeness to the Trump administration had been seen as a boon for Tesla, given its business with SpaceX and NASA and the regulatory levers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could pull in getting autonomous driving rules in place for Tesla's robotaxi testing.

But demand weakness in the EU and recent protests at US Tesla showrooms have followed Musk's controversial foray into politics, causing some Tesla owners to become alienated by Musk, specifically by his right-leaning tendencies, DOGE, and outward support of President Trump.

Tesla's big robotaxi test is slated for June 12 in Austin. Much of the company's value is tied to whether it can fully unlock autonomous driving for robotaxi purposes and individual owners.

Meanwhile, Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Waymo continues to plow ahead and is essentially the leader in the space, accumulating 250,000 robotaxi trips per week.",1377,82,callsonreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1l3yldf/tesla_stock_falls_again_as_musks_kill_the_bill/,1l3yldf

2025-06-02 18:08:47,r/TSLA,Clarity on Elon's dual Robotaxi plans?,"Elon Musk goes back and forth between two ideas on how Robotaxi will work, and I want to know what the real vision is:

The first plan is that Tesla will develop Robotaxi cars that are different then the models currently offered. They will own these Robotaxis and will operate the business much like how Waymo already does. 

The second plan is that the current models of cars will collectively be ""robotaxi"" and not owned by Tesla. Rather, the regular owners of cars can add their cars to the robotaxi fleet as they feel, generating income for both the owner and Tesla. 

The second plan seems more profitable than the first because the cost of owning and maintaining the vehicle eats into profits. It's like the profitability of Uber compared to the profitability of Waymo.

The court stated they lacked a valid national emergency justification and infringed upon congressional powers. We saw a huge move in the market afterhours yesterday, mainly interested to see if we can continue the move. Is the tariff madness over? Absolutely not, but I'm interested in seeing if we keep momentum upwards. 

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)\-NVDA reported Q1 revenue of $44.1B, with data center revenue at $39.1B vs $39.3B exp. The company said that guidance would have been $8B higher except for lost sales from the China restriction on H20 chips. I was mainly interested in the $140 level yesterday and we blew past that afterhours yesterday. Overall, great earnings report with further hopes that China restriction is lifted. Not too interested in  Keep in mind that ATH is \~$152.

[**ELF (e.l.f. Beauty)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ELF&amp;p=d)\-ELF announced the acquisition of Hailey Bieber's skincare brand, Rhode, in a deal valued up to $1B. The transaction is $600M cash/$200M in stock, and potential $200M earnout based on Rhode's growth over the next three years. This ended up reversing ELF's earnings report yesterday (which was negative due to the thread of tariffs), and signaled that ELF is moving into skincare. We've made a pretty huge move up to $105.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d)\-Tesla plans to launch its robotaxi service in Austin on June 12, utilizing driverless Model Y vehicles. Elon Musk also confirmed he is leaving the government DOGE initiative and will focus on the company. This has been on a tear for the past month- that break from the $300 level was what I was most interested in, interested if we set up again for $375/$400. The launch of its robotaxi service is another way to signal that it's challenging Waymo, but whether it will succeed without LIDAR or not is another question.

No Apple, Amazon, or Tesla which are too consumer facing. Have the AI tech behemoths, which are also the true quantum plays. Have insurance companies, contrarian bets, mix of mid cap growth companies which have proven themselves with continuously strong earnings reports, and few crazy growth stories.

**The Rules**: DCA daily, when fear and greed index dumps below 25 then aggressively DCA even lump sum. If a company has more than 2 bad earnings more-so guidance than they're out.

**Good Time To Buy?**: I believe they're all overpriced right now. Will hedge with UVXY calls buying monthlies, selling against the position creating diagonals at various strikes when there's an upcoming binary event which could be negative catalyst.

**Changes This Time**: Am combining timing the market increasing DCA'ing amounts, actively managing based off of ER's/guidance, and hedging against during drawdowns using longer dated uvxy calls.

For me this is extremely bullish as his involvement with TSLA was the main driver for its success &amp; stock price.

**Nvidia Earnings Highlight Slate of Tech, Retail, Financial Reports This Week**

Nvidia is scheduled to report its quarterly earnings on Wednesday. The chipmaking giant recently returned to the $3 trillion market-capitalization level after its share price rallied by around 50% from its April low. The earnings report follows the company’s announcement that it will supply semiconductors to Saudi Arabian AI startup Humain. Nvidia reported 78% year-over-year revenue growth in its prior earnings release. Semiconductor firm Marvell Technology is also scheduled to report this week.

Salesforce’s expected report on Wednesday comes after the cloud software provider reported 8% revenue growth in its prior quarter on the growth of its Agentforce custom AI platform. While the firm delivered a worse-than-expected outlook, analysts said the company had strong potential for growth.

Thursday’s scheduled report from Dell Technologies will show whether the computer maker continues to benefit from increased demand for AI infrastructure after it grew server and networking sales by 37% in the prior quarter. Morgan Stanley recently raised its price target for the company, citing growing server sales momentum on AI demand. Market watchers will also be following computer equipment maker HP’s scheduled report on Wednesday.

Costco Wholesale is on Thursday’s corporate calendar, coming as the membership-based retailer reported that its April sales rose by 7%, which analysts attributed partly to customers rushing purchases ahead of U.S. tariffs. Costco reported a 9% revenue growth in its prior quarter on increased revenue from higher membership fees.

AutoZone’s scheduled report on Tuesday follows an upgrade from Bank of America Securities as analysts argued that higher auto costs from U.S. tariffs could lead to more vehicle repairs by cost-conscious drivers. Dick’s Sporting Goods’ expected report on Wednesday follows its recent deal to acquire sporting goods retailer Foot Locker (FL).

Investors will be watching the scheduled Thursday report from Chinese EV Li Auto, which competes with Tesla (TSLA) sales in that nation. The Tuesday report from PDD Holdings comes as the parent of Chinese-based online retailer Temu faces pressure from U.S. tariffs.

Inflation, GDP, Fed Speakers in Focus

Friday’s scheduled release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index will show how the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation fared in April. A similar inflation reading showed that price increases cooled somewhat in April, and the Fed has said it is closely watching prices in the wake of Trump’s tariffs.

Wednesday’s expected release of the minutes of the May meeting of the FOMC will provide more insight into Fed officials’ deliberations over interest rates and the economy. Likewise, several Fed officials are scheduled to speak during the week, including Fed Gov. Waller, New York Fed President Williams, and San Francisco Fed President Daly.

Revisions to first-quarter GDP are expected on Thursday after the initial report last month showed that the economy shrank in the first three months of 2025.

The state of the consumer will also be in focus for investors, with reports on consumer confidence and consumer sentiment scheduled to be released this week. The reports come as recent surveys show that consumers’ moods have soured over concerns that tariffs will drive prices higher. Friday’s expected reports on the U.S. trade deficit, retail inventories, and wholesale inventories will provide more detail on how U.S. tariffs are affecting the economy. ",82,13,callsonreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kv2as8/what_to_expect_in_the_markets_this_week_may_2730/,1kv2as8
2025-05-22 20:08:31,r/stocks,Why Shorting Never Works,"Once upon a time the market attempted to price stocks for what they would be worth in the future. Buying and selling decisions were made based on fundamentals and forward guidance. Over time we have drifted from this concept, and become the market we have today. Debt, earnings, current revenue - these things do not matter. Bond yields at nosebleed levels? Who cares. All that matters is the potential for a revenue increase at an unknown date in the future. Look at quantum stocks, they are wildly overvalued by standard metrics. But they continue to fly higher. Why? Because at some point in the next 10-20 years they will earn more revenue than they do today. 

Look at CRWV, burning cash but promises to have future revenue (because companies who need ai compute capacity will never build out their own capacity right?), so it will continue to go up in a straight line. Likely for months or years, maybe forever. 

Look at TSLA. Huge future revenue promises for robotics and self driving. Maybe even ai too. Doesn’t matter if none of it happens, the stock will continue to move higher. 

Huge debt risks for the US? Downgrade and terrible 20 year bond auction showing risks of something very terrible coming? Doesn’t matter, indexes will always go up, there will be no dip that matters. It will always v up. The market IS different now. Debt will continue to grow and the globe will continue to support the US. If things get dire the government will just offer mild tariff relief if other countries agree to buy up massive amounts of US bonds and treasuries. The system will never fail, stop betting that it will.

The moral of the story here is simple, shorting never works. Period. Stocks that go down will go up more in the future. Because everyone believes that buying the dip works, it works. And it always will. This is likely very annoying for a lot of people who think valuations are high etc. If you are one of those people just give up. This time IS different. The globe has been conditioned to buy the dip. It will never stop. So join the herd or get run over by it.

Elon Musk announced that Tesla (TSLA) is launching a self-driving ride-hailing service in Austin, TX. It’ll start with about 10 vehicles and scale up to 1,000 within a month. He also mentioned a goal of having 1 million fully autonomous vehicles in operation by the end of next year.

The service will be geo-fenced for safety and allow Tesla owners to rent out their autonomous cars, similar to Uber or Airbnb’s model.

TSLA stock jumped over 3.5% intraday on the news, while competitors like Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) dipped 1–2%, showing how seriously the market is taking Tesla’s expansion into ride-hailing.

If you believe in the long-term potential of autonomous mobility and tech disruption, this might be a major growth driver for TSLA. Definitely something to keep an eye on.

News: [Trump Wants Apple To Stop Moving Iphone Production To India](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/trump-wants-apple-to-stop-moving-iphone-production-to-india)

[**UNH (UnitedHealth)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&amp;p=d) \- The U.S. Department of Justice is conducting a criminal investigation into UnitedHealth Group for ""potential Medicare fraud"" related to its Medicare Advantage business. The probe, active since at least last summer, is looking into ""questionable diagnoses"" to inflate payments from Medicare. UNH dropped close to 40 points yesterday afterhours. Not sure if it'll continue but short biased unless we make some insane move downward even more. The spike premarket was attributed to them denying the news. This news is particularly bad because DOJ confirmed investigation is criminal. Other stocks such as HUM/CVS/CI have moved on this as well.

[**ETOR (eToro)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ETOR&amp;p=d) \- eToro's IPO priced at \~$68 per share, above the expected range of $46–$50, and the stock bounced off \~$65 off some strong bids. Mainly interested to see if the strong bids at $65 still exist (unlikely but I'll just keep an eye out anyway). Mainly a sector play in C-brokerages and the C-Market, since most of their income is derived from it. Beyond what I highlighted in the IPO analysis post, not interested in this long term. Probably will just trade as a proxy to the C-market in the future and I don't like the structure of their contract for diffs.

[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&amp;p=d) \- Alibaba reported Q4 revenue of 236.45B yuan, a 7% increase year-over-year, but slightly below analyst expectations of 237.91B yuan. Income from operations nearly doubled to 28.47B yuan driven by improved efficiency and reduced share-based compensation. This has been on a decent run since April 8th (peak fear tariff selloffs). Watching $125 level. Alibaba's cloud division saw an 18% revenue increase, with AI-related product sales posting triple-digit growth.

[**FL (Foot Locker)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FL&amp;p=d) \- Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS) confirmed a $2.4B acquisition of Foot Locker at $24 per share, nearly double Foot Locker's previous closing price. Currently long and interested in seeing if we can converge even closer to $24, but overall don't see any other trade in this except for a reversal of news. Mainly integration challenges and potential antitrust concerns are the big risk, but unlikely with current admin.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d) \- Tesla's stock has risen from $275 to $350 over the past six days but failed to break the $350 level twice. Currently short pretty close to $350, but will bail if we break $350 (probably a lower price level like $345). TSLA has mainly been on a tear (attributed to Musk stepping away from DOGE and returning to TSLA), and the news of Tesla board exploring a new pay deal for the CEO dropped yesterday. Mainly a short play based on how parabolic the stock has been, but will bail as needed.",23,8,WinningWatchlist,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kn7o0m/0515_interesting_stocks_today_doj_investigating/,1kn7o0m

News: [Deepseek Races After Chatgpt As China's AI Industry Soars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-13/deepseek-races-after-chatgpt-as-china-s-ai-industry-soars)

[**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)\- NVDA is set to ship 18,000 of its advanced GB300 Grace Blackwell AI chips to Saudi Arabia's Humain for a 500 MW data center project. Additionally, the Trump administration is considering a deal that would allow the UAE to purchase over a million NVDA AI chips, easing previous export restrictions. This caused NVDA to skyrocket 10 points yesterday, watching for additional momentum today. Interested if we can make an equivalent move today and if the trend is strong, might buy a little if so- note that NVDA has earnings on 5/28. Overall interesting that NVDA is finding sales outside of China, but not sure if the ME can make up the shortfall.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d)\- TSLA has been on a tear ever since Musk has stepped away from DOGE, going from $275 -&gt; $340 in 5 days. Was watching this since $300, the next major level I'm watching is $350- considering how we exploded upwards after the election, not very enthusiastic to short this unless we go to stupidly high levels like $400+. So for now, biased long. Musk has been controversially politically but the stock performance did hinge on his presence at the company, so interested to see if this is going to blow everyone out of the water shorting it (eg me) like last time lol. 

[**UNH (UnitedHealth Group)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&amp;p=d)\- UnitedHealth Group's CEO Andrew Witty has stepped down, and the company has suspended its 2025 forecast due to higher-than-expected medical costs, leading to a massive selloff yesterday. We dropped close to 70 points yesterday, I was personally hoping for the selloff to reach $300 but ultimately didn't get that far. Bought a little around $310 but will kick this out by selling calls against it because volatility is high. UNH has been through... a lot this year with Luigi and the CEO shooting, the proposed AI to analyze healthcare claims, and now this. We've fallen close to 40% after the *new* CEO stepped down as well. Expecting a small dead-cat bounce and a small slow recovery today, other than that not sure how they're going to navigate out of this.

[**SMCI (Supermicro)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&amp;p=d)\- Supermicro has announced a multi-year $20B partnership with Saudi data center firm DataVolt to deliver GPU platforms and cooling systems for AI campuses in Saudi Arabia and the United States. Made a pretty large 10 point move yesterday, and I want to see if we can make an equivalent move today to see if the trend is strong- interested in the $50 level.

They’re slapping 10-15% tariffs on stuff like chips, iPhones, and even some cloud services, hitting names like Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft hard. EU’s calling it “supporting local innovation,” but it smells like a cash grab to me.Here’s what I’m chewing on:

* AAPL’s already got thin margins on hardware. Tariffs could force price hikes or eat profits—either way, stock takes a hit, right?
* NVDA’s GPU dominance might not care about EU rules, but if China retaliates with their own tariffs (they’re already rumbling), supply chains could get messy.
* Smaller players like AMD or QCOM might feel the pain faster than the big dogs. Anyone holding these?

I’m not seeing much buzz about this on X or here, but markets don’t always price in risks like this right away. Are we all too busy chasing AI pumps or TSLA’s next tweet to care?

First Musk will perfect his robots in Tesla plants, and then he will replace the vast majority of Tesla auto factory workers with robots. Tesla's EV's will be the hands-down cheapest and best American electric vehicles, due to greatly reduced labor costs. Maybe Tesla cars won't sell well for a while, you say, because ""everyone hates Musk"". That's ok, with whatever Tesla vehicles don't sell, Musk will simply deploy them all as massive fleets of electric self-driving robotaxis that start undercutting Uber and Lyft all over America. There will soon be an energy crisis due to mass proliferation of AI GPU's, and electric vehicles. The fastest easiest solution to increase energy production incrementally is guess what...? SOLAR.  So then Tesla will make a killing by selling its state-of-the-art solar panels, and Chinese solar panels won't be able to compete in America, thanks to Trump tariffs. If skyrocketing silver prices becomes an issue, Musk will simply buy some silver mines like he said he might. Meantime, the Big-3 American Auto makers will be forced to replace their workforce with robots from Tesla, in order to lower their vehicle prices to compete with the cheaper and superior Tesla autos. Or maybe the Big-3 won't abandon UAW, and they'll all sink together. Either way Tesla wins. Musk will make sure worker robots are sold gradually in a strategic fashion, determining the Winners \[those who are allowed to purchase worker robots first, before competitors are allowed\] and Losers \[those who aren't allowed (or don't want to) purchase robots, and are forced to stick with American human labor\].",0,0,CrazyAspie88,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kcfyh4/electric_vehicles_solar_panels_and_humanoid/,1kcfyh4

News: [Weekly jobless claims surge to 241,000](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/01/weekly-jobless-claims-surge-to-241000.html)

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d)\- Tesla chair denied reports of a search for a new CEO to replace Elon Musk, reaffirming the company’s commitment to its current leadership structure. This news initially broke overnight yesterday and the stock saw a 6 point drop. I personally had the bias that it would actually be bullish for the company, so I'll likely trade a second move rather than the first if I'm at the computer for the trade. Moved down to around 270 overnight, will watch for additional confirmation. As most of you know, Musk's political involvement has made him controversial, and by extension, TSLA as well.

[**RBLX (Roblox)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RBLX&amp;p=d)\- Reported Q1 results with a loss of $0.32 per share vs. $0.40 expected and bookings of $1.21B vs. $1.14B expected. Raised 2025 bookings guidance to $5.285B–$5.36B, above analyst consensus of $5.27B. Interested in $74 level, other than that not too interested in the stock. No new risks beyond whatever has been said before (slower user growth, regulatory risks, platform outages, problems with minors, etc). Buy your kids some Robux!

[**MSFT (Microsoft)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSFT&amp;p=d)\- EPS of $3.46 vs. $3.22 expected and revenue of $70.07B vs. $68.42B expected. Capex surged to $16.75B, up 53% YoY, as it ramps up AI infrastructure, noting expected AI capacity constraints beyond June. Interested in seeing if it holds above $430 at market open. Its outsized AI investment was of huge interest to me- this moved a lot of Mag 7 names higher, especially NVDA. It signaled that there's still room for growth for these chip-makers. Companies that rent out computing space such as CRWV also moved higher on this as well. (It signals that they'll do better on earnings). 

[**META (Meta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&amp;p=d)\- Reported stronger-than-expected Q1 revenue; Q2 sales guided to $42.5B–$45.5B.

Heavy AI spending along with digital ad rebound trends pushed semis upward, they stated their sector focus remains on monetization of AI-driven engagement tools.

2025-05-01 11:46:40,r/stocks,"Tesla board opened search for a CEO to succeed Elon Musk, WSJ reports","Tesla TSLA.O board members about a month ago reached out to several executive search firms to find a successor for CEO Elon Musk, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the discussions.

The current status of the succession planning could not be determined, WSJ said.

The EV maker has faced declining sales and profits, with investor concerns mounting over Musk’s involvement in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), where he has led efforts to cut federal jobs.

Musk has said he would cut back significantly the time he devotes to the Trump administration and spend more time running his many companies.

It is also unclear if Musk — being a member of the board himself — was aware of the effort, or if his pledge to spend more time at Tesla has affected succession planning, the report added.

Tesla and Musk did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.

Im debating between PLTR and TSLA. I feel like TSLA has so much potential in the AI space with their fully autonomous taxi service that allows Tesla owners to make money with their cars, however, waymo is a strong competitor here. The other TSLA project im pretty bullish about is their AI robots. The ceo of Nvidia recently said that they believe autonomous robots are the next stage of the AI boom. I think there is a lot of potential here if companies can adopt them to save money with more manual work.

My biggest worry with Tesla is the controversy surrounding it. Tesla's name has been completely destroyed internationally. BYD was already beating them by a lot but now its going to be bad. I also am a bit worried that the CEO will continue to do more to destroy the Tesla name through other shocking actions.

1-reporting standard for AV involved crashes will be lowered NOT eliminated; I guess that saves Tesla a few buck every month.
2-AV vehicles can be built with less hardware (mirrors, brakes) since they don’t need a driver.  I guess we can lower the cost of the car a bit. 

So how does this warrant a 10% price move today on TSLA after prior days move after a horrible earnings report?  Did everyone see “less regulation” titles and assume that all of a sudden Tesla cars would be driving themselves, because it was the previous regulations that was stopping Tesla from having an actual autonomous car deployed?

SPY dark pool inflow was heavy, yeah, but the majority of the late prints were at bid, not ask. That’s smart money selling into strength, not loading for continuation.

TSLA was heavily distributed at the top, despite the media pump. Price action stayed glued to gamma walls, no real organic movement past resistance.

VIX dropped but didn’t collapse, which is weird. If this rally was legit, VIX should've flushed much harder. Holding above 23 tells me big players are still hedged.

After-hours was ""calm"", but a little too calm. No meaningful momentum, no real follow through.


It’s hard to call tops, I’m not claiming to. But between the sell-side dark pool flow, the late-day bid prints, and VIX refusing to die, I’m definitely raising an eyebrow.

Just my two cents.

This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Trump Says He'll Be Very Nice To China In Trade Talks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-23/trump-says-he-ll-be-very-nice-to-china-in-trade-talks)

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d)\- Reported Q1 earnings with EPS of $0.27 vs. $0.39 expected and revenue of $19.34B vs. $21.11B expected. Total revenue declined 9% year-over-year, with automotive revenue dropping 20% to $14B. Net income fell 71% to $409M, or $0.12 per share. The company attributed the decline to factory retooling for the refreshed Model Y, lower average selling prices, and increased sales incentives. That was a brutal earnings report, yet Trump announcing that he'll be nice to China saved the stock and pushed the entire market up. Interested in $275 and $250 levels.

[**SPY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&amp;p=d) **/** [**QQQ**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&amp;p=d) **/** [**VXX**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&amp;p=d) **/ China Stocks** / **Tech Stocks**\- President Trump signaled a potential substantial reduction in China tariffs, which currently stand at 145%. Whether this will actually hold and be his stance going forward is entirely up to him (he changed his mind a lot during 2019's trade wars). Assuming that the market holds up today, I'm primarily watching my current positions in NVDA/AAPL and ready to flip short if we make some ridiculously unsustainable move or if Trump changes his mind.

[**LLY (Eli Lilly)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LLY&amp;p=d)\-Filed lawsuits against four telehealth companies for selling unauthorized compounded versions of its GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. (LLY's diabetes drug Mounjaro went into short supply in 2022, allowing pharmacies and outsourcing facilities to produce the treatment, a practice called compounding). These drugs generated over $16.4B in revenue last year. Interestingly enough I see this case as pretty major despite not moving the stock significantly today, deciding whether GLP-1 is essentialy ""genericized"" to the point where any company can sell it or only the original developers of the drug. NVO might face the same thing in the future. If LLY loses, that's a huge blow for both of them.

[**HTZ (Hertz)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HTZ&amp;p=d)\-The potential rollback of tariffs by the Trump administration could negatively impact Ackman's thesis that used cars are more valuable due to tariffs. The stock is nearing $9, the previous high when the tariff news was announced. I'm interested in shorting the stock if we make a parabolic move up or if we fail to break $9 (but as always, it's dependent on how we get there). Automotive rental companies have benefited from higher used car values amid tariff-induced supply constraints.

Tesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.

Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.

It’s been a brutal start to the year for Tesla, with CEO Elon Musk spending much of his time in President Donald Trump’s White House, overseeing an effort to dramatically downsize the federal government. The president’s sweeping tariffs plan has led to concerns that costs will increase for parts and materials crucial for electric vehicle production, including manufacturing equipment, automotive glass, printed circuit boards and battery cells.

Tesla shares are down 41% so far in 2025, and suffered their worst quarterly drop since 2022 in the period that ended in March. The stock was little changed in extended trading on Tuesday.

The company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will “revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”

In its shareholder deck, Tesla cautioned investors that “uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers.” The company said this “dynamic,” and “changing political sentiment” could have a meaningful near-term impact on demand for its products.

Tesla has faced widespread protests in the U.S. and Europe, where Musk has actively supported Germany’s far-right AfD party. Earlier this month, the company reported a 13% decline in first quarter deliveries from a year earlier to 336,681.

Tesla has been struggling to keep pace with lower-cost competitors in China, and is a laggard in the robotaxi market, which is currently dominated in the U.S. by Alphabet’s Waymo. The company has promised to launch its first driverless ride-hailing offering in Austin, Texas, in June.

The company reassured investors on Tuesday that it remains on track for a “pilot launch” in Austin by that point, and to begin building its humanoid robots on a pilot production line in Fremont, California, this year.

Operating income in the quarter slid 66% to $400 million from $1.17 billion a year earlier, resulting in a 2.1% operating margin. The company cited an increase in expenses tied to artificial intelligence projects as one factor in the decline.

The company would have lost money on automotive sales without environmental regulatory credits during the quarter. Revenue from the credits, which Tesla receives for selling fully electric vehicles, increased to $595 million from $432 million in the same quarter last year.

Energy generation and storage revenue jumped 67% in the quarter to $2.73 billion from $1.64 billion a year ago. The company said growth in AI infrastructure is “creating an outsized opportunity for our Energy storage products to stabilize the grid, shift energy when it is needed most and provide additional power capacity.”

Tesla uses foreign suppliers for its energy business. The company said “increasing tariffs may cause market volatility and near-term impacts to supply and demand.”

I think the only thing that sends the stock soaring is if Elon uses the call to publicly announce he's stepping down from DOGE and devoting 100% of his efforts to TSLA.

2025-04-22 21:10:34,r/stocks,Everyone is wrong about TSLA tomorrow. Here is why....,"As we know. TSLA has their Q1 earnings at market closed today (22Apr). 

The resulting stock movements at market opening tomorrow are going to be pivotal for many traders. People are going to win ot lose a LOT of money. 

I've seen a lot of split theories on executing calls vs. Puts... and the analysis on what will happen tomorrow is exciting. 

Personally I think TSLA will start with an immediate drop due to their obviously low sales performances. 

However, the speculative discussion at earnings cannot be ignored (robots, robotaxi etc)..... 

Here is the kicker. Tomorrow I don't think it matters whether you bet calls or puts. Tomorrow is going to be extremely volatile, and we could see 20% swings in either direction. At 11am ET, all the bears could be patting themselves on the back while TSLA drops to $190, but by 2pm, the stock has rapidly climbed to $270 and the bulls were right. 

Tomorrow is ALL about timing. Get your schedules cleared and back up internet installed because you won't want to miss a moment.

2025-04-22 17:36:08,r/stocks,Tesla Earnings: Two predictions and what to watch for after.,"Position: I am short on Tesla.

Apparently, Elon is going to talk today: [Elon Musk breaks his own Tesla (TSLA) earnings rule in desperate move](https://electrek.co/2025/04/21/elon-musk-breaks-tesla-tsla-earnings-rule-desperate-move/)

We all know what this is about: Building hype to distract from the endless onslaught of bad news for Tesla. Elon is going to deploy his ERDF (Elon Reality Distortion Field) to pump up his meme stock. This comes as no surprise to anyone here. 

Prediction #1: Taking the likely prediction from the Tesla bulls, Elon will tell investors the same old story of Tesla becoming ""not-a-car-company"" anymore and to completely ignore all of 2025. (Source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2025-largely-doesnt-matter-tesla-113124531.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2025-largely-doesnt-matter-tesla-113124531.html) ). Also, not really a big stretch of the imagination here. 

Prediction #2: Just for fun, I will make a very specific prediction of how Elon will use his ERDF to dazzle the mouth breathers into dumping more money into his meme stock. I expect that he will roll out the Optimus. It will do the following tasks, in order:

1. Perform some silly preprogrammed maneuver that makes it look like it is self-aware. It will look at it's hands or something similar to make it look like it has ""intelligence"" and ""awareness"". Just watch the dumb video they have already put out there.
2. Elon will throw a bunch of small, non-fragile, objects out on a flat surface and say: ""*Now watch this!*"". 
3. The robot will quickly grab each small object, maybe something like a domino, and arrange them quickly in an ordered fashion. It might even flick the first one to knock down the chain. 
4. Controlled remotely by a human off stage, the robot will wave goodbye to a choreographed verbal prompt from Elon and then walk off the stage. Maybe it will even do a little dance for us. 
5. The bleating sheep will go nuts and the stock will pop. 
6. End sham demo. 
7. Begin hand-waving and tech-jargon spewing to explain away endless mounting problems for Tesla. 

I predict this because of Elon's long history of stage-hyped vaporware demos. This will be really easy for him to pull off because they can just rip a few sensors and software out of the common pick-and-place robots already used in their production lines and quickly cobble them into the Optimus. It is going to look just like the pre-canned routines production robots run at manufacturing trade shows but for dimwits that have never been to one and think this is all ""new"" technology. 

Most importantly: This will gloss over the inconvenient fact that any ""brand damage"" Elon has caused Tesla, will also surely impact the sales of any other consumer product they will launch in the future. For example, an obscenely expensive robot that will likely be unable to scramble an egg for you. 

The whole ""Tesla is not-a-car-company anymore"" earnings (so ignore the lack of earnings) show will also gloss over the fact that, like everything else ""new"" at Tesla, it is an old idea and they are way behind the competition (e.g., Waymo/Google in the Robotaxi space). The idea of a car company making humanoid robots was first put out there by Honda with ASIMO over a quarter century ago. They developed it. There was no consumer market for it. So, they repurposed it. There still isn't a consumer market here (longer discussion). And there is already a second generation of advanced humanoid robots for manufacturing from a company called [Figure building BMW's in Spartanburg, SC](https://www.bmwgroup.com/en/news/general/2024/humanoid-robots.html). Let's also just ignore all the more advanced humanoid robots coming out of China just like we are told to ignore BYD that just surpassed Tesla without even having access to the US market. If Elon says it's the future, it ""Musk"" be true, and Tesla will somehow be the ***only*** company in the world doing it. 

Will Tesla's stock pop today? Probably. But who really knows with any meme stock. Performance and numbers haven't mattered at all in the past for Tesla. Retail investors are just a herd of bleating sheep that will easily get caught up in the ERDF. What I am going to be looking for is 45 days from the end of Q1 when the data from the 13F Forms comes out. Watching what the big institutional investors are doing will really be telling. I strongly suspect, given previous reports of retail investors buying up [Tesla like never before](https://www.investopedia.com/why-teslas-stock-soars-despite-car-sales-numbers-11705040), that the institutional investors are going to slowly reduce their positions in Tesla and orchastate themselves a nice soft landing on the backs of gullible retail investors. Given that institutional investors hold about half the company, I predict that this news is what will really drive the stock price for the foreseeable future.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d) \- Tesla is set to report Q1 2025 earnings today after market close. Analysts anticipate EPS of $0.41 and revenue of $21.54B, reflecting a 13% YoY decline in deliveries to \~337K units. TSLA faces challenges from declining EV sales, brand damage, and potential impacts from new auto tariffs. I'm mainly interested in sub-$200 buys as a small reversal trade, not sure if I'll take a short position prior to earnings. Not interested in trading if the earnings are good. Risks include continued decline in deliveries, margin compression, and potential regulatory impacts from tariffs. Something else I'm interested in listening for is lessened political risk- if Elon is announcing an actual step down from DOGE then that might help the stock.

[**SEDG (SolarEdge)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SEDG&amp;p=d) / [**FSLR (First Solar)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FSLR&amp;p=d) \- The U.S. has finalized tariffs up to 3,521% on solar imports from Southeast Asia, targeting countries like Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Most of our solar capability is imported from SE Asian countries. This move is meant to protect domestic manufacturers like SEDG and FSLR. Not too interested in this as a day trade, more as a swing trade.

[**NOC (Northrop Grumman)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NOC&amp;p=d) \- Northrop Grumman reported a 49% drop in Q1 profit, with EPS of $3.32 vs. $6.32 YoY, due to a $477M charge related to the B-21 stealth bomber program. Revenue fell 7% YoY to $9.47B, missing expectations. Overall, many defense companies are losers from tariffs due to rising production costs and shifting geopolitical dynamics. Companies like NOC are under pressure to manage expenses while maintaining strategic programs which are essentially impossible due to tariffs. Risks include escalating costs in defense projects, potential delays in government contracts, and geopolitical uncertainties.

[**JKS (JinkoSolar)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JKS&amp;p=d) \- JinkoSolar, with U.S. manufacturing capabilities, stands to benefit from the new tariffs on Southeast Asian solar imports. Despite initial market reaction, the company's domestic presence positions it favorably in the current trade environment. FSLR and other domestic producers cannot manufacture the entire US's solar needs by themselves- JKS is likely to pick up the slack with their own manufacturing. But frankly, FSLR/ENPH/domestic producers are safer trades IMO.

According to the latest Bank of America fund managers survey published this week, nearly half of the fund managers surveyed (49%) see long gold, or bets that gold prices will rise, as the most crowded trade in the market right now. This marks the first time in two years that fund managers did not see the Magnificent Seven as Wall Street's most crowded trade, according to the survey.

2025-04-15 05:00:20,r/stocks,How bad is this for TSLA?,"Tesla is facing significant pressure to address a major shortfall in its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology.
Approximately 4 million vehicles equipped with the Hardware 3 (HW3) computer- installed in Teslas produced from April 2019 through late 2023-are unable to achieve the promised unsupervised autonomous driving capabilities. This revelation contradicts Tesla's earlier assurances that all vehicles produced since 2016 had ""all the hardware necessary for full self-driving capability.""

In January 2025, CEO Elon Musk acknowledged that HW3 lacks the necessary processing power for full autonomy. He stated that Tesla would need to upgrade the computers in vehicles of customers who purchased the FSD package. This admission has sparked discussions about potential compensation or hardware upgrades for affected owners.

The situation is further complicated by (HW4) computers. In early 2025, Tesla recalled over 200,000 vehicles due to HW4 units short-circuiting, leading to failures in safety features like rearview cameras. The company is addressing these problems through over-the-air software updates and, when necessary, hardware replacements.

Given the scale of the HW3 issue and the costs associated with potential retrofits or compensation, this could become one of the most expensive recalls in automotive history. Tesla has not yet detailed a comprehensive plan for addressing the HW3 limitations across its fleet.

Tesla Inc. investors need to ask themselves: How do you price in sentiment?

Chief Executive Elon Musk's involvement in Washington and his leadership role in the so-called Department of Governmental Efficiency, or DOGE, have been driving the narrative lately on Tesla's stock $(TSLA)$ - for better or worse.

The stock rallied in the final quarter of 2024, running up by 120% between late October and mid-December, partly on a strong sales outlook and partly because of Musk's closeness to President Donald Trump. Investors hoped his ties to the administration would be positive for Tesla.

Now, though, those ties have become a liability for the electric-vehicle maker. People are vandalizing Tesla dealerships, charging stations and cars driven by its customers. Even those who aren't actively boycotting the brand may be deterred from owning a Tesla right now.

The company is heavily consumer-facing. About 77% of its revenue comes from consumer vehicles, and Tesla also sells energy products to consumers. So brand sentiment and its impact on sales matters. The truth is, very few high-profile brands have seen backlash and political boycotts to the degree Tesla is now experiencing.

Bud Light serves as one example, but to a lesser extent. Following an April 2023 boycott of Bud Light, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA's (BE:ABI) stock tumbled by about 16% in a little over a month. Sales for Bud Light haven't recovered. So gauging the fallout from backlash against Tesla ahead of its future earnings could be difficult.

Bob Lang, founder and chief strategist at Explosive Options, suggests turning to soft data to try and determine how consumers feel about the brand. A survey by YouGov from March showed that 37% of respondents said that Musk is either part of or wholly the reason they wouldn't consider owning or leasing a Tesla.

What does the data tell us about Tesla's stock?

Its technicals look rough

If you're a trader, you could probably resort to an endless number of indicators to gauge short term moves. But for longer-term investors, the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages matter because they show long-term trends.

As of Friday morning, Tesla was near the ""death cross"", which is when the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average, a bearish signal.

""Why is that significant? It means that big institutional money is going to think twice about buying below this after the crossover is done,"" Lang said.

2025-04-10 20:43:31,r/stocks,Tesla Skyrockets Over 22% In A Single Day: Massive dual blast from the ERDF annihilates bears.,"Well... It's time for a little self-deprecating humility and humor. 

Position: I am short on Tesla (still). Yesterday sucked.

In two of my previous posts on r/stocks ""**Tesla Hidey Hole (Richmond, VA)- Don't believe the numbers tomorrow but the ERDF is real.**"" and **""Forbes: ""Elon Musk's pet project- the dumpster driving Tesla Cybertruck..."" is one of biggest flops in automotive history.**"" I shared my ever growing conspiracy theory predicting the downfall of Tesla based on three things:

1. The ERDF.
2. Unscrupulous accounting that cloaks poor performance.
3. And the downfall of Tesla will eventually be caused by the human element.

Here is how it went down and what we can all learn:

Yesterday, after seeing the ego-fueled feud breaking out between Elon and Navarro (predictable), I desperately continued to search the deep, dark corners of the internet looking for anything to feed my confirmation bias in an attempt to make myself feel better about taking such a risky short position. Then it happened. Just what I was looking for. At **10:06am**, it is announced by Eletrek that Tesla's Director of Accounting Controllership, Harsh Rungta, is leaving the company:

Source: [Tesla’s top financial controller leaves (TSLA) ](https://electrek.co/2025/04/09/tesla-top-financial-controller-leaves-tsla/)

I think: ""*This is it. It's finally happening!*"". All the pieces are fitting together. Not only is does this fit with my zany prediction (a key person leaving from the accounting side), Harsh Rungta is a former PwC guy (Tesla's independent accounting firm), so he probably has buddies inside that are telling him to jump ship before it sinks. I throw on my tinfoil hat, lick my lips, and wait for the stock to start dropping. 

**10:10am:** Sinister looking faceless people in black downhill bicycle racing helmets wearing gloves start pulling levers and pushing illuminated buttons. The bears don't know it yet- but we are doomed.

**Soon thereafter- ERDF Blast #1 goes off:** My news feed starts getting hit with reports of Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh reiteraterating his ""outperform"" rating. A rating solely based on the same old tired and empty promises of the same old ripped-off concepts of future vaporware that will turn Tesla into ""not-a-car-company"" (some day), while lowering his massively inflated target price to something appearing slightly more sane to insane people. All the while, conveniently downplaying all the rising competition, trade war implications, and brand destruction happening in plain sight (per usual for these analysts). 

\*Shit- not looking good now\*

**1:18pm:** A second massive blast from the ERDF is released by Trump on Truth Social, announcing a 90-pause in the tariffs. But not for China. They are getting hit with a 125% increase and escalation to escalate the trade-war. (But that doesn't matter. Even though it really does). 

**1:20pm:** The ERDF generates a massive disturbance in the Force (aka- the stock market). Millions of bears suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. *Something terrible has happened.*

What did we learn? Two important things:

1. Headlines beat undercurrents every time. 
2. The ERDF has grown more powerful than anything anyone could have ever imagined. 

For those that want to know: The ""Elon Reality Distortion Field"", or ERDF, is a real thing that I completely made up to make you laugh. 

**The ERDF- What it is and how works:** The EDRF is a headline generating and hype boosting force with unparalleled power. It can use it's force to pull in suckers from all over the world with a single blast and get them to dump money into Tesla stock. It can be used to elevate meme stocks and keep them going up regardless of reality. It is so powerful, that even smart people who understand it's power but don't believe in the company will invest in Tesla stock, knowing there is an endless supply of suckers (and maybe short sellers to squeeze). 

First, it was just Elon capturing the imaginations of people with his vision of a high tech, sporty, eco-friendly, EV with his theatrical stage shows (back when everyone thought he was cool). Then, it grew into something with the power of a Star Destroyer fleet after Elon made a massive (but deliberate) investment to acquire Twitter and change it to X. Now, X is a gargantuan social media platform of purchased/hijacked users which has been transformed into a massive Elon-only-world-view amplifier for the ERDF (i.e., it is highly censored to fit his narrative). Then it grew into a force as strong as a Death Star surrounded by a fleet of Star Destroyers when Elon and Trump pulled a Voltron and combined forces as POTUS and owners of two separate social media companies. Elon would like to use his ERDF to reshape the entire world in his own image now. And sadly, for us mortals, the force of the ERDF has indeed taken over the entire world.

\*Except Wisconsin. The odor of cheese is the only thing that can repel the ERDF and muskrats are terrified of badgers. Coincidence? I think not...

I find the timing of analysts reiterating the same bullish ratings, news, fake news, and social media posts more than a little suspicious. We all know we are being jerked around but the magnitude of swings all this is causing is ridiculous. The markets were tested to see how they would react to a pause in tariffs with fake news, numbers were crunched, then it happened for real. 

Both Trump and Elon openly grift on crypto and I see this as a continuation of a behavior pattern that has worked for them in the past, just using the stock markets. And they aren't even trying to hide their conflicts of interest anymore. Owning your own social media company, where you, as the POTUS, post news releases that create massive, record-breaking intraday swings in the global markets based on reckless, off-the-cuff decisions you are making on the fly, thereby boosting the number of users on your platform by offering an exclusive source of information that has massive and immediate impact on the largest and fastest flows of money in the entire history of the world, is just a slight conflict of interest don't you think? *\*I used 7-commas in that run-on sentence.* 

The thing I find most interesting, is many of the companies that shot waaaaay up (e.g., Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, etc.) should have been completely hammered with the announcement of tariff increases on China. All of these companies have manufacturing and supply chains that are heavily dependant on China and the trade war with them is only escalating. Tesla got a double boost yesterday during all the madness when it should have been a double whammy. As explained by one person that gets paid to write about such matters: 

""*I say I’m not sure why Tesla also surged on this news, but it’s mainly because it’s a meme stock now. It doesn’t really trade on its actual earnings potential.*

*Also, Tesla shareholders appear to be clueless about what’s happening.*""

As wiser Obi-Wan Kenobi-like Redditors have warned on my previous posts: ""Stay away from Tesla. It's a meme stock."" They know and respect the power of the ERDF. And as Elon himself has said: ""*There is a large graveyard filled with my enemies. I do not wish to add to it, but will if given no choice.*"" He's not wrong when it comes to short sellers . Also remember: Porkins didn't survive the attack on the Death Star. This next wave of shorties probably won't either. But if fundamentals, actual product sales, brand destruction, and real numbers start mattering to Tesla, the ERDF might come down. That is our only hope.

Stocks go down and they go up and never how you expect them to so expect the unexpected. Generally speaking the markets overreact to things and do not like uncertainty. Bear markets or bearish moves are short and violent and bull markets / bullish moves are longer steady and short live draw downs (if any) and just have more sideways consolidation moves before future higher legs. The trend is your friend so follow it and don’t try to time the next one.

Here’s a look at the **15-minute chart on $TSLA** from **March 30 to April 5, 2025**.

Only **two patterns appeared**, and both were **bearish Tweezer.**

**What Are Tweezer?**  
Tweezer patterns can be **bullish or bearish**, depending on the trend context.

Here’s what defines them:

• **Two consecutive candles** with either matching highs or matching lows

• The **second candle rejects the same price level** as the first, showing hesitation or resistance

• Typically appears at the **end of a strong trend**, signaling potential **momentum exhaustion**

• The identical highs or lows indicate that **buyers or sellers couldn’t push through a key level twice**

**What It Tells Us:**

• Potential **trend reversal**

• A shift in sentiment — from bullish to bearish, or vice versa

• Can offer a **swing trade setup** for entering long or short positions

If you spot them at key levels, they might give you solid entry signals — just like we saw on this chart.

I'll add more daily ones, in the upcoming days.

2025-04-05 00:26:00,r/stocks,Market downturn trigger?,"I scrolled a little bit, and most of what i am seeing on the sub is about tarrifs. Is anyone talking about the impact the downturn of TSLA may have had in precipitating the overall market event? 

I don't currently have access to the information, but i would imagine that a sudden - truly unexpected - drop in a blue chip value stock like TSLA would cause an institutions balance sheet to become very lopsided. I'm thinking the current sell off is due to deleveraging against short positions.

Tarrifs are ugly... political and civil unrest - sure... a bit scary, but that seems to have been fuel to the fire as the match was being lit.

Check my thoughts -  but I truly think EM may have gaffe'd the biggest gaffe that has ever been gaffed. Yes, no? Teslas market cap is down close to half a trillion dollars. That is huge.

2025-04-04 17:20:29,r/stocks,"CMV: Trump's tariffs are political weapons intentionally designed to create leverage over nearly every country, industry, and company.","I've seen a lot of discussion here about why Trump is doing these tariffs. For example, I've seen:    

1. He is doing this to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.A.  
2. He is doing this to ""punish"" countries for their tariffs and trade imbalances on and with the U.S.A.   
3. He doesn't know what he's doing, and is dumb and/or short-sighted.  
  
While I see where the logic for these explanations is coming from, I think there is a very real chance that the true explanation is that **Trump's tariffs are a political weapon, designed to give him leverage over nearly every country, industry, and company.** By instituting tariffs, rather than just threatening them, now the clock is ticking: countries, industries, and companies are frantically trying to figure out what to do.     
  
Think about it: first, Trump went after universities, threatening to withhold funding unless they caved to his demands about diversity and pro-Palestinian protestors. This has already forced major institutions, like Columbia, to bend the knee to him.  
  
Then, Trump went after big law firms and their clients, threatening through Executive Orders to cut off their access and intimidate them. This has already resulted in major law firms (Paul Weiss and Skadden) to forge ""settlements"" to do free pro bono work to the President's bidding, though luckily some of these firms (Perkins Coie) have had the integrity to fight back and sue.   
  
Following this logic, it follows that Trump with his tariffs doesn't legitimately believe what he is telling the public about his intentions. Far more likely, I think, that he is using these tariffs to force pledges of loyalty, concessions, and ""deals"" with countries, industries, and companies. 

This is not my original idea, to be fair; I heard it from U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D - Connecticut). He has pointed out that democratically-elected leaders turned despot/authoritarian/fascist will use tools like this to maintain power. Trump knows he cannot be reelected due to term limits, so how does he hold on to power? Like this. It is a slippery slope towards becoming a dictator. 
 
I can only hope that some countries/industries/companies see through this B.S. and fight back, but it is likely that many—now that their finances are being hurt—will bend the knee. 

Going back to the common explanations for Trump's tariffs, here are my counterarguments:    

1. If this was intended to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.A., that doesn't make a lot of sense. Companies aren't just going to upend decades of supply chains to invest billions into a country whose people don't want a lot of dirty, hard-work manufacturing jobs, especially when everything could (likely) revert back when Trump is out of office in 4 years.   
2. I won't pretend to be an economist, but a big reason for the trade imbalances is because Americans like buying stuff from XYZ countries. That isn't those countries' fault, necessarily. And moreover, the chart Trump showed at the White House Rose Garden this week did not accurately reflect the actual tariff rates that foreign countries place on the U.S.A—it included trade imbalances, which makes zero sense and is highly misleading, if not an outright lie.   
3. Trump may appear dumb, but he has scores of well-planned sycophants from groups like the Heritage Foundation (Project 2025 authors) that are advising him. It is highly unlikely that they planned so much of his presidency, but the tariffs themselves were an afterthought.   
  
Now granted, we have heard rumors that the tariffs were hastily put together, and that Trump's team may have used ChatGPT to write some of the policy out. At first, this appears to support explanation no. 3. However, I think the hasty nature of these tariff policies actually supports the idea that they are purely intended as political weapons: it doesn't matter what exactly the tariffs are, what matters is creating immediate leverage.   
  
Curious for the community's thoughts. 

Disclosure: I have divested heavily from the U.S. markets and gone into EU stocks, especially defense. I am also short TSLA, DJT, and Air Canada.

**EDIT:** As seeming proof of this theory, American journalist Kara Swisher [reported on BlueSky today](https://bsky.app/profile/karaswisher.bsky.social/post/3llynh6uoyk2z) that ""Several sources tell me a passel of high profile tech and also finance leaders is making a trip to Mar-a-Lago to read Trump the riot act — um talk common sense — to him on the tariffs. Their million dollar donations to the inauguration is turning into billions in losses.""  
  
Translation, I think: executives are bending over backwards to try and get concessions from Trump. This shows he has leverage over them already.",1045,355,colenotphil,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jreh6b/cmv_trumps_tariffs_are_political_weapons/,1jreh6b

Tech stocks plummeted on Thursday, with Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)) leading ""Magnificent Seven"" names lower following President Trump's[ reciprocal tariff announcement](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-every-country-facing-reciprocal-tariffs-announced-by-trump-on-liberation-day-231329935.html) the day prior.

Shares of Apple, on track for their worst day since March 2020, cratered over 8% in afternoon trade as the stock erased $300 billion from its market cap. The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.

On Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India — all set to take effect on April 9.

Notably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important [production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.

""Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[ like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.

As trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.

""The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,"" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate ""this new world of tariffs.""

Until then, he warned, ""tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.""

Other Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.

In afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.

Outside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.

""The implications \[of the announced tariffs\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \[chip\] sector,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. ""These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.""

Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.

He added, ""The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP. [So if this tips us into recession, ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.""",218,4,callsonreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jqpre5/apple_sheds_300_billion_in_tarifffueled_selloff/,1jqpre5

if you still think elon is running tesla, you're delusional. tesla makes money from cars, not some fantasy robotaxis or humanoid robots that are nowhere near real. the guy is too distracted trying to be a political influencer instead of fixing his sinking brand.

tesla in 2022 could sell any car they make  at any price. now? they're slashing prices and still struggling. cybertruck owners have to worry about their cars getting vandalized because the brand is toxic. it's not just the usa—he's managed to turn europe and the uk against tesla too. if china weren’t so cut off, he’d probably have tanked that market as well.

there are plenty of smart people who could run tesla better, but elon has the board in his pocket, so there's no real accountability

Roughly two weeks ago, I posted my short thesis on Tesla. Predictably, I got a wave of backlash—mostly from the usual Tesla bros telling others to “stay poor” while defending the stock with blind optimism. But now that some time has passed, the technicals and fundamentals are becoming harder to ignore. Tesla is clearly in Wyckoff distribution territory. Last week’s high was $291, and since then, the pattern has continued to follow the textbook signs of smart money exiting.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jheaxd/tesla\_short\_thesis\_and\_the\_us\_market\_house\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jheaxd/tesla_short_thesis_and_the_us_market_house_of/)

At the same time, we’re seeing a massive retail influx—$67 billion poured into U.S. stocks recently—while institutional investors are quietly heading for the exits. That dynamic alone should raise red flags. Tesla perfectly illustrates this: retail is still buying the hype while the data says otherwise.

Globally, Tesla is seeing declining sales and shrinking EV market share. Institutional holders are dumping their positions, yet mainstream media continues to push the narrative that “everything is fine” and a big comeback is just around the corner. That’s simply not true.

The reality is that Tesla’s forward P/E ratio and perceived moats are crumbling. The market is slowly waking up to the fact that the hype isn’t sustainable. Tesla bulls are trying to hold the stock up, but the fundamentals and macro forces are turning this into MyPillow 2.0.

We are just one earnings report or one round of global retaliation tariffs away from Tesla plummeting into the low $200s or even high $100s. China would be thrilled to see Tesla decline while BYD continues surging in global EV sales.

What’s ironic is that even now, we're still seeing articles predicting a ""major comeback"" for Tesla. But comeback to where? $140? Let’s be honest—we’re not even in the markdown phase yet, and when that phase begins, the bags retail investors are holding will only get heavier.

To those saying “people have failed to short Tesla before,” you're right. But that was back when Tesla was simply overvalued on forward earnings—a story investors could still get behind. Additionally, it had the support of the world as a feel good car company that was trying to make a difference in climate change. Now, it’s different. The brand is turning toxic. Elon Musk, once the golden child of innovation, is now alienating much of the public and damaging the brand’s appeal. Don't @ me, I know he didn't invent anything, but he did popularized EV and mainstreamed it.

Meanwhile, EV sales as a whole are growing, but Tesla’s are falling—by double digits. That gap tells you everything.

Many retail investors are clinging to Tesla out of a sunk cost fallacy, hoping it will rebound. But hope isn’t a strategy. And in this case, it's a dangerous one that could wipe out a lot of portfolios. I'm sure the Tesla bros will love this post. s/ but you can't ignore the fact. There has been zero good news and the stock keep dropping. Zoom out.

And of course, we can’t forget that Tesla still has the blessing of none other than the Titan of Wealth Destruction herself—Cathie “Motherfreaking” Wood. Yes, the same Cathie Wood who’s still confidently projecting a $2,600 price target for Tesla, despite all signs pointing to the opposite direction. At this point, it’s almost comedic.

I’ll be revisiting this topic in a few weeks—after the institutional investors and hedge funds have quietly exited their positions and left retail investors holding the bags. Let’s see where the stock price lands once the dust settles. Spoiler: it’s probably not going to be anywhere near $2,600.

News: [Trump Weighing Tariff Options As Rose Garden Event Nears](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-01/trump-weighing-tariff-options-as-rose-garden-event-nears)

# Trump speaks at the Rose Garden at 4PM EST today- be on the lookout for incremental headlines or anything that is passed on from his admin.

A sign of escalation and a warning, China is essentially responding in kind that it will give tariffs back (just like 2018). Reduced Chinese investment could result in less liquidity in the markets overall and larger volatility. If you want to see a reminder of how Chinese stocks performed when we got into a trade war, look at 2018-2019. We haven't a seen a meaningful move in these stocks yet, but if there are responses from China in kind to the tariff announcement today, things are going to get volatile,

[**SPY (S&amp;P 500 ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&amp;p=d), [**QQQ (Invesco QQQ)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&amp;p=d), VXX, etc. - President Trump is set to unveil new tariffs today but is still finalizing details. Options include a tiered system (10%-20%) or a flat 20% global tariff. We're likely going to see a LOT of incremental headlines today on this until Trump speaks in the Rose Garden; I'll be watching what he says on the websites he posts on, and going for the speed trade on this. He is expected to talk at 4PM Eastern. Obviously, a lot of volatility and uncertainty due to no one knowing what exactly the tariff plans are going to be. The imposition of new tariffs could escalate trade tensions, leading to retaliatory measures from affected countries (which we don't know the extent of how many are affected) and impacting global economic growth.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d)\- Tesla reported preliminary March China deliveries of 78.8K vehicles vs 89.1K YoY. The company has delivered 336,681 cars in the first quarter, far fewer than the 390,000 expected. The decline in Tesla's China deliveries was a bit of a signal that the global sales would be bad, but frankly this wasn't as terrible as I expected. Currently short, will cover if we break $260 to the upside. Also interested in the $250 level. You guys know the risks by now (BYD and competitors, Musk, politics, etc).

No real move in these stocks yet but I expect any news headline that is negative for TikTok to be great for the companies I'm watching (social media rivals). A ban on TikTok could alter the membership for the social media sites mentioned (they have to go somewhere). Since this is a weekend headline, I'm thinking of buying more GOOG- if TikTok DOES get banned, then these companies will likely gain. Otherwise, business continues as usual and they don't benefit. .",27,21,WinningWatchlist,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jpoamx/interesting_stocks_today_042/,1jpoamx
2025-04-02 15:10:00,r/stocks,"Tesla reports 336,000 vehicle deliveries in first quarter","Tesla reported 336,000 vehicle deliveries in the first quarter of 2025, two days after the electric vehicle company’s stock wrapped up its worst quarter since 2022.

Here are the key numbers:

* Total deliveries Q1 2025: 336,000
* Total production Q1 2025: 362,000

Investors were expecting Tesla to report deliveries of between 360,000 and 370,000 vehicles, according to StreetAccount. Tesla’s investor relations team sends a company-compiled consensus to select analysts, and said the average estimate was for around 377,590 deliveries. Prediction market company Kalshi on Tuesday released a forecast for Tesla deliveries of 352,000.

In the first quarter of 2024, Tesla reported 386,810 deliveries, and production of 433,371 vehicles.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of vehicle sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company’s shareholder communications.

Tesla doesn’t break out sales and production by model or region. However, the company said that it produced 345,454 of its most popular Model 3 and Model Y cars and delivered 323,800 of them in the three months ending March 31.

The company reported 12,881 deliveries of its other models, including its angular steel Cybertruck.

During the quarter, Tesla faced planned, partial shutdowns in some of its factories that allowed the company to upgrade manufacturing lines to start producing a redesigned version of its popular Model Y SUV.

CEO Elon Musk recently said during an all-hands session with Tesla employees that he expects the Model Y to be the “best-selling car on Earth again this year.” 

But Tesla has to contend with an onslaught of EV competition and reputational damage. In the first quarter, the company was hit with waves of protests, boycotts and some criminal activity that targeted Tesla vehicles and facilities in response to Musk’s political rhetoric and his work as part of President Donald Trump’s second administration.

After spending $290 million to help return President Donald Trump to the White House, Musk is leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), where he’s slashing costs, eliminating regulations and cutting tens of thousands of federal jobs.

Musk, the world’s wealthiest person, has also involved himself in European politics, promoting the anti-immigrant AfD party in Germany in February’s elections. Tesla’s business on the continent is struggling.

Across 15 European countries, Tesla’s market share declined to 17.9% in the first quarter from 9.3% in the same period a year earlier, according to data tracked by EU-EVs.com. In Germany, Tesla’s market share in battery electric vehicles plummeted to 4% from about 16% over that stretch.

Tesla shares sank 36% in the first quarter, their steepest drop since the fourth quarter of 2022 and third-biggest decline in the company 15 years on the public market. The drop wiped out $460 billion in market cap.

2025-04-02 08:47:15,r/stocks,"Tesla Hidey Hole (Richmond, VA)- Don't believe the numbers tomorrow but the ERDF is real.","Before I jump into the stock related stuff, as an old, I feel it is important to preface this with a little cautionary advice. Here is my three points of ""don't be stupid"":

1. I know Richmond has a storied history of burning shit going all the way back to the Civil War- but don't burn any Teslas. It's not worth it. And it's stupid. Furthermore, you are putting first responders at risk. You will also likely get caught. At least here in Virginia, there are [cameras everywhere](https://cardinalnews.org/2025/03/28/i-drove-300-miles-in-rural-virginia-then-asked-police-to-send-me-their-public-surveillance-footage-of-my-car-heres-what-i-learned/) and Tesla's themselves will record you. It's just not worth throwing your life away no matter how mad you might be. Before you get labeled a domestic terrorist and thrown in an El Salvadorian prison, read some Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and get some perspective. He wrote from a Russian gulag after sharing his negative opinion of Stalin. We are currently on Reddit and nobody is going to jail for it.
2. Don't harass individual Tesla owners. They didn't do anything to deserve it and most likely hate what is happening as well. I know some of them. It is unreasonable to ask them to dump their daily driver at a huge loss because Elon decided to make himself into a human lighting rod.
3. I deliberately waited for the ""Tesla Takedown"" to be over before making this post so nobody would get any bright ideas. What you think is making a difference is likely to have the opposite effect from what you are hoping for. The people trying to stick it to Trump just got him more [support from billionaires](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckvvlv3lewxo) after he was convicted and if you didn't notice, $TSLA started deep in the red yesterday after the Tesla Takedown over the weekend and rallied way back and finished considerably up today. None of that moved the needle in any direction but up. Furthermore, if you burn or vandalize a Tesla, the insurance company will pay for it and just jack up all of our rates in turn. If any destroyed cars are still owned by Tesla, they will just use accounting methods to write it off. And that is one less car they don't have to sell at a time when they aren't selling many, which is the ultimate point of this post and makes a nice segue.

If you are mad about what Elon Musk is doing, or just want to make money on your $TSLA puts (like me- position disclosed), what sends a stronger message? A few burnt up Teslas or entire parking lots full of them because nobody wants to buy them? In my opinion, as well as [others with puts](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/nick-denton-interview-thiel-musk) on Tesla and think Elon has lost it, it is the latter. Speaking of which... I found one such parking lot!

First, check out the few pictures I took of the local Tesla dealership here in Richmond (just outside the city). Their lot is clearly over capacity but nothing jaw dropping. There are a few dozen vehicles on the street and in a neighboring parking lot. After I shared these with a few friends, one of them told me that there were vehicle transporters unloading new Teslas near his work, which is a few miles away from the dealership and in an area of office buildings that have nothing to do with Tesla. I checked it out and there are a lot of them stuffed in the back of the lot. It's hard to see because I took the pictures at night and the cars are spread out but there are easily over 20 Cybertrucks and probably somewhere near 50 vehicles in total.

Obviously, my local dealer isn't selling enough cars to keep up with their deliveries (no surprise to anyone). But the big question I have is: Are these vehicles considered ""delivered""? Tomorrow Tesla reports how many vehicles they have ""delivered"" (not the same as sold). And if you haven't been paying attention as of late, Tesla has had some questionable practices going on in [Canada with their sales](https://fortune.com/2025/03/26/elon-musk-tesla-under-investigation-canada-wrongfully-boosting-sales/) and some possible questions raised about their accounting methods with the [$1.4 billion discrepancy](https://mashable.com/article/tesla-missing-billion-dollars) in their books. Going back a little further, there was a whistleblower that reported [Tesla deliberately messes](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html) with their delivery numbers to make it appear as if they are selling more new cars than they really are.

Point being, no matter what is reported tomorrow, I am not going to believe the numbers Tesla provides. If there are new Teslas being shoved into an obscure parking lot in my city, it has to be happening elsewhere. At some point, I suspect the vehicle overflow will get noticed in other places too. Has anyone else found a Tesla hidey hole?

Most importantly, even if the number suck tomorrow, I doubt it will make that much of a difference in the stock price because of the ERDF. What is the ERDF you ask? It is the ""Elon Reality Distortion Field"" (ERDF). And this incredibly powerful field effect is really all that matters when it comes to anything ""Elon"". It's real. And people should acknowledge it as such or risk their own peril. Nothing logical or sane applies to Elon Musk and it never has.

Edit/Update: Despite missing on deliveries, $TSLA is not really down that much. Everything is being affected from the tariff news so any impact isn't really noticeable. And the sales miss is being explained away by the Model Y refresh, as widely expected and foretold by just about every media outlet covering Tesla. No surprises in the ERDF holding $TSLA strong despite the bad news.

But not Elon. In fact, just the opposite occurred. He became, and remains to be, the richest man on Earth. This displays the tremendous power of the ERDF- It is nothing like the world has ever seen. Even more powerful than [Jewish Space Lasers](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/marjorie-taylor-greene-qanon-wildfires-space-laser-rothschild-execute.html).

The ERDF is by far and away Elon's greatest invention and achievement. If there are two things Elon should get tremendous credit for, it is knowing when to invest in the right things and building hype around them. The guy is a six-dimensional hype machine from outer space with uncanny prescience. From PayPal to SpaceX, he saw where future opportunity was being underinvested in and took it over. When it comes to Tesla, he even knew when to make it ""not a car company"". Using the power of the ERDF, he made it an AI, self-driving vehicle, taxi, and humanoid robot company just in the nick of time before sales of their actual product fell off a cliff. This company is now known as ""Tessler"". Now, it doesn't matter if they sell any cars at all. Elon is using the ERDF to sell the future and even control the presidency. And it's working. It sounds crazy as hell but we are all watching this happen in real life.

Amazingly, the ERDF has allowed Elon to stall indefinitely on all promises of delivering the future and show absolutely no meaningful results for over a half-decade. Nor is Tesla a first mover in any of their new initiatives. Waymo (Google) has already launched self-driving taxis that are available using Uber and even in buzzing around in Austin Texas, where Tesla is headquartered. The idea of humanoid robots has been around forever. And one behemoth of a car company already developed one. But that happened over a quarter century ago. The car company was Honda and the robot was called ASIMO. And nobody cared. They discontinued it in 2018. Elon's ""Optimus"" has only been seen to do preprogrammed demos that look like Boston Dynamics routines from the early 2000's (nobody cares about them either). They have also been spotted shuffling around like Joe Biden. Neither the Robotaxi or Optimus robot are anywhere close to being released. And I have strong doubts as to what utility, if any, the Optimus robot will have for anybody. All of this seems to be a distraction created by the ERDF to draw attention away from the fact that Tesla still hasn't achieved ""full"" self-driving (and [ignored LIDAR sensors](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/03/17/lidar-vs-cameras-a-giant-fail-for-tesla/)). I am expecting Elon to come out with a ""Fred Flintstone"" sedan next, with no floor that you power with your feet, and telling everyone that it will be the future of travel. If Elon says it, then it ""Musk"" be true (the guy has a name that just keeps on giving).

With no first-mover advantage in the driverless taxi space, being behind tech giant Google there, and reviving an old failed sci-fi robot idea from their much larger and more established competitor in Honda, you would think Tesla would get graded down for unoriginality. But nope. The ERDF kicks in yet again and [most analysts are bullish](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-stock-dives-as-another-bullish-analyst-worries-about-deliveries-5e90f869) and astonishingly, Cathy Wood, seemingly most affected by the ERDF (and other things that make people stupid), thinks Tesla stock is going to reach an astounding [$2,600 in five short years](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-reaffirms-tesla-2-212612251.html)! That's about 10x more valuable than it is today, giving Tesla a market cap somewhere around $8.5 trillion dollars. That would make Tesla more valuable than all the other major auto manufacturers, Uber, Lyft, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, combined in today's market (with a trillion to spare). Does that sound realistic? You can call me a skeptic of Cathy Wood...

Again, make no mistake, the ERDF is real. And if we are talking straight stock price, it matters. It might be the only thing that matters. Love him or hate him, it seems that Elon and his ERDF manufactured the most successful ad campaign in history right on the lawn of the White House. But it wasn't for the cars. It was for the stock. All the new people getting sucked into the ERDF because of Elon's new found bromance with Trump have no idea of what has been happening with Elon prior to his involvement in politics. And they don't care. They just know him as ""Tech Support"" guy and Trump's new ally. They love Trump and there is no shortage of them. They might be willing to wait another 5-years for Cathy's insane prediction to come true, not knowing everyone else had already been waiting for 5-years before them. Fresh meat so-to-speak. Tesla's 10-day average volume is over 138 million shares. And most of this is [retail traders going bonkers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/tesla-s-retail-fanboys-buy-the-stock-at-a-pace-never-seen-before?embedded-checkout=true) for Tesla and Elon. It is likely that Elon has masterfully used his ERDF to transition retail stock holders from younger, tech savvy and/or environmentally conscious investors to straight up Fox News Dads in less than one quarter.

While it has already been noted on this sub that institutional investors are likely pumping $TSLA to orchestrate a soft landing for themselves (on the backs of retail investors), I don't think they can exit too quickly without causing a complete fiasco. They only have to report 30-days after each quarter ends and they trade in dark pools. So, we plebeians won't know what the big institutional holders are doing until after they have done it (unless they report sooner). And if any one big institutional investor dumps their position fast enough to spook the market, there will certainly be consequences. Both political and financial. The finances between Elon, his many ventures, and his personal loans must be a complete nightmare of both complexity and scale. While in theory Elon could be ""margin called"" for his loans that have Tesla stock put up as collateral for, I am not so sure it would happen even if the stock drops significantly. The banks just went through a crisis of confidence with the whole Silicon Valley Bank collapse. If something triggered Elon's house of cards to collapse, it could have larger implications for his lenders and they might take a lot of heat for it. And the banks certainly don't want to invite in more oversight. They might just eat the loss and hold the shares in hopes they eventually regain their value. For that reason alone, I think the chances of Elon getting margin called are slim. But I would definitely be keeping an eye on the institutional holders once they report at the end of this month to see if there are any notable changes.

Edit/Update: A few hours after posting this, it was reported that [Swedish firm Folksam](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/swedish-insurer-folksam-divests-its-tesla-shareholding-2025-04-02/) closed their entire position in Tesla. While not nearly as big as other institutional holders, it was still about $160M worth of stock. That's not chump change. (Mods: Sorry for originally using a Seeking Alpha article in the link- I didn't know they were blacklisted). 

To end this manifesto post, and give the shorts a little glimmer of hope, I offer one possibility that has not really been talked about all that much. Despite the massive power of the ERDF, some people do indeed escape it. And despite all the hype around AI, robots, and automation, Elon's companies are still run by the most unpredictable machines on the planet- humans. Tesla's long time CFO and potential successor for Elon, Zachary Kirkhorn, left suddenly in the [summer of 2023](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-cfo-zachary-kirkhorn-steps-down-replaced-by-vaibhav-taneja-2023-08-07/). Four more of Elon's top executives and direct reports left in [short order in 2024](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-loses-4-top-executives-ahead-of-robotaxi-event-2024-10). Baglino sold off his [$180 million in shares](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/25/former-tesla-svp-drew-baglino-is-selling-181point5-million-worth-of-stock.html) when he left. Not much of a vote of confidence there. And Tesla as a whole recently [fired a massive number of employees](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/tesla-started-laying-off-14000-employees-it-couldnt-have-gone-worse.html). From the reports, Elon seemingly did it in the same smug and indifferent manner in which he fired people at Twitter and is currently doing in the federal government.

Ultimately, if people become disenfranchised and are no longer willing to do Elon's bidding, his enterprises will fail. And there is only so much you can pay people to motivate them before you lose profitability. To make a Star Wars analogy, the only way I see to bring down the ERDF that protects and surrounds Elon's seemingly unstoppable Death Star, is if people on the inside of his operations lose faith in him and get tired of his bullshit. All the people around Elon: His loyal followers on X and even president Trump to some extent, don't do anything for him but build his ego and amplify the strength of the ERDF. But none of them know how to design and build cars or launch space shuttles. That's a very small group of very intelligent people that cannot be replaced as easily as retail investors. It's the smart people on the inside that make all of Elon's visions come into reality. In the end, I think the human element might be Elon's undoing.",515,288,iD-10T_usererror,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jpicww/tesla_hidey_hole_richmond_va_dont_believe_the/,1jpicww

Basically, you can go to the SEC Edgar's database and see every single CEOs buying and selling within about 24-hour notice. That's not the hard part. The hard part is that all the data is so government red taped that it's a pain in the ass to read then calculate. And CEOs use that to their advantage to hide when they dump their own shares. One of the ways they do this is by exercising options then selling the same amount of shares. What ends up happening is that it looks like they didn't sell any shares at all but what they really did was buy shares at like a 90% discount that were entitled to them by the board of directors from way back when then sell the same amount of shares that they've been holding. So they're dumping stock without their net holdings numbers changing. Anyways, there's a whole bunch of different ways they try to game the system and hide their moves. 

All that's been super clarified and transparentized. 

I'm going to leave a non-clickable link so that it keeps the traffic to a minimum and nobody thinks I'm a spamming but before you go buying a whole bunch of stocks or even crypto, I recommend that you look for insider trading.

[**SPY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&amp;p=d)**,** [**QQQ** ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&amp;p=d)**,** [**VXX** ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&amp;p=d)**,** [**USO**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=USO&amp;p=d) , larger tech stocks - ""Liberation day"" (additional tariffs) is nearing, causing the market to selloff due to fears of escalating trade tensions and potential global growth impacts . We're pretty close to near lows from 3/13 (18 days ago, lol). 

Overall will be trying to buy a bounce for a day trade if we do end up breaking, but probably will be more focused on a VXX short rather than buying the market overall. I'm interested if we selloff or pop on the open, if we break new lows I may short/then flip long. This kind of headline-driven macro environment is a pain in the ass to keep track of, but creates a lot more opportunity for short-term trading. Risks that can change the tariff narrative or move the market include unexpected retaliation from trade partners, weakening consumer/investor confidence (like last week's numbers), and spillover into energy and commodity prices (Trump has signaled some action on oil, but we aren't sure what yet). 

**NVDA**[ **(Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)\- Another interesting thing that caught my eye this morning are reports from Chinese media that NVDA's new chip (GB300) are significantly delayed due to complexity and may be a quarter or two delayed (thus resulting in missed/delayed revenue). This could explain why NVDA is down significantly more (-3.5%) vs other semis. 

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d) \- Analysts have trimmed Q1 delivery estimates for TSLA amid weakening demand trends and delays in its Model Q vehicle (the cheap, Robotoaxi car). There have also been articles of divestment from pension/investing funds that are invested in TSLA that I've read, but whether those are serious, I'd hold judgement on. 

Delivery numbers are expected Wednesday and typically report premarket, so good to be cognizant of that. I'm interested in seeing if we can hold below $250 today. The EV sector in general has entered a consolidation phase, with cost competition and flagging consumer incentives weighing on demand, and BYD is hot on TSLA's heels and likely going to overtake TSLA within the year. Below-consensus deliveries could spark a guidance reset for earnings, margin compression of their other cars due to the Model Q, and market share loss in China and Europe are key concerns. Also random people torching Tesla dealerships.

[**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&amp;p=d) \- No material news catalyst, but PLTR has experienced five consecutive red sessions and is likely moving with the overall stock rout. Worth noting that PLTR cut close to 60% of its IT Team (said by CTO in recent interview), and DoD cut close to $600M in spending (which affects PLTR). Also worth noting that we are EXACTLY right back to where we started before we had significant retail interest in this stock ($80). The broader AI/data analytics sector has seen a pullback after a multi-month run and has been somewhat outpaced rational valuation so not too interested in this for the long term.

2025-03-30 18:37:34,r/stocks,Challenging the Noise: A Closer Look at Tesla's Q1 Projections,"As we have all seen, there are a ton of headlines about Tesla's (TSLA) declining sales numbers, and it's honestly a bit overwhelming. Here's a quick breakdown of what I gathered:

* Europe sales are reportedly down by 45%
* China sales have decreased by either 49% or 29%
* Australia sales are down by 65.5%

\^\^ keep in mind there are a ton of articles and headlines on this, I picked from a few \^\^

With all these headlines, it's tough to figure out what timeframes they're talking about. Is it one day, one week, three months? Who knows?

Amidst all this noise, I decided to dig deeper into what we should actually expect. While analysts' projections aren't great, they don't seem as grim as the headlines suggest.

**Global Tesla Sales (Q1):**

* **2024 Actual**: 386,810 units
* **2025 Initial Projections**: 412,000 units (median of 398K-426K range, which would've been a 6.5% increase)
* **2025 Current Projections**: 377,000 units (a 2.5% decrease from Q1 2024)
* **Projection Change**: Initial to current projections dropped by 8.5%

**USA Sales Breakdown (Q1):**

* **2024 Actual**: 140,187 vehicles
* **2025 Current Projection**: 138,867 vehicles
* **Change**: Only a 0.9% decrease in the US market

These numbers don't look great, especially for a company like Tesla that's all about growth. But we're still talking about single-digit declines quarter-over-quarter, assuming the analysts are somewhat correct.

I wanted to understand what the Q1 report might reveal because, going by the headlines, it seemed like it would be terrible. But after digging in, it doesn't seem as bad as it feels. Is it just me?

2025-03-28 23:15:26,r/stocks,"Gave Ai the tools to do technical, fundamental and social analysis. Presented a solid fact based bearish case for TSLA in under 5 minutes","**TLDR: Gave Sonnet Sonnet-3.7 access to the latest financial data, technical indicators, news report, and reddit/twitter sentiment and asked it to analyze TSLA over the past 6 months. It predicted TSLA’s future outlook to follow the current downward trend, with a price target of $210 in then next 6 months, citing its recent sharp decline, Elon’s behaviour, and production issues.**

# The Idea.

So using LLMS/AI models to analyze stocks is slightly more complicated than it seems. Most AI models have a set limit on the amount of data they can ingest in any one conversation, this usually sits around 100-200k words max. This meant that for the level of analysis that I wanted it to conduct, which would require at least the last 6 months - 1 year of daily open / close, trading volume, company financials, news, online sentiment, I couldn’t just simply upload giant csv’s, and text files to the model and tell it analyze the data for me.

Instead I gave the AI model access to a coding environment where it would autonomously decide which financial metrics to grab, and how to go about plotting them. Since most financial data is usually just an API call away, the model could pull down data from the market and then conduct analysis on the data using **self-written code** and then ingest the returned images and print statements from the code using its multimodal (**vision**, text) capabilities.

Given this setup, I chose Sonnet 3.7 Sonnet for its SOTA agentic, analytical, coding and mathematical abilities.

Searching **reddit, twitter, and news sentiment** was much easier, though very expensive, since these are just text, which is something that ai models are pretty good at summarizing already.Finally I strung both of these together, and gave the AI/Model access to them through a sandboxed environment where it could choose which tools to use at its will without going too rouge

# The Task

Now that the AI was equipped with the tools it needed, it was time to test it. To prevent the AI from going too broad, I had to structure my prompt in a way that guided it through the **DD process.**

**The prompt:**“I want you to do a deep analysis for TSLA over the last 6 months and determine whether you are bullish or bearish on the stock, and also give me a 6-month price target. Please retrieve TSLA price data for the past 6 months and plot it on a graph, then use technical indicators to perform a comprehensive technical analysis, making sure to mark areas of interest. Make sure to help me visualize this process. Then analyze TSLA's financial metrics and compare them with its competitors, presenting visuals for this comparison as well. Finally, gather online sentiment and general information about TSLA. In the end, provide me a comprehensive report on whether TSLA is bullish or bearish. The report should be in markdown format and include all the visuals.”

This prompt was written in a way to guide the Ai  to systematically accomplish each task one by one and then and combine it findings into a final dashboard. This way the ai would not get lost in the sauce and instead stick to a defined action plan. **This was by far the highest return on effort I noticed through out the different trials.**

# Results

**Challenge 1: Plot stock Price + Basic visual overview** 

Sonnet starts by writing **code to grab 6 months worth** of price data for TSLA. All the following steps it executes will be with code, I will spare you the exact code it returns after this one, because it does get very verbose and repetitive.

I auto-fed back every image that it generated in order to leverage its vision capabilities to pick up on overarching trends  **without ingesting individual data points.** This helped it steer away from context window exhaustion. Here it gave a brief analysis of the basic price chart.

**Challenge 2: Technical analysis**

This was a slightly more challenging task since Sonnet isn’t too familiar with the Pandas-Ta library (python technical indicator library).

[Technical Analysis using Python library (Pandas-ta)](https://imgur.com/cAU59ua)

[Chart breakdown](https://imgur.com/oJdbevv)

By **citing the fundamental technical analysis** done in Python and the visual plot, it was able to give me a relatively good analysis of the indicator action and how this affected the price. The **“death cross**” it recognized around January was a pretty decent pick up besides the general indicators.



**Challenge 3: Comparing Tesla to its competition**

I gave Sonnet the ability to query and filter through **all of the NYSE and NASDAQ** based stocks using over **248** fields. Crafting the right query to grab the most relevant fields to my prompt was the biggest challenge.

[Grabs 10 metrics to compare Tsla to competitors](https://imgur.com/mXM53OV)

[Visualization of Tsla vs Peers](https://imgur.com/aRYrE7w)

The analysis compared Tesla to 9 other automotive companies: **BYD, FORD, GM, LCID, Li Auto, NIO, RIVN, and Toyota.** As always it then provided me with a visual of the metrics to help illustrate the breakdown

[Visuals breakdown](https://imgur.com/D9Fa0es)

It was able to extract pretty much all the **key insights** I was looking for, barring some minor ones like CAGR. The analysis made much more sense when displayed side by side with the visuals.

**Challenge 4: Deep Web search + Social Search (Twitter and reddit)**

We gave sonnet an endpoint to call that would provide it with the entire texts from the **top 5 google search results**, at most **100 reddit comments** and a vector search over hundreds of **tweets regarding each stock in this case, Tsla.** All Sonnet needed to to do was call the right tool and enter a meaningful query, and it would receive a giant text file with the search results from the news, reddit and twitter.

[Sources](https://imgur.com/KUxFQDE)

**Part one** of the search yielded results cited only from news sources. This approach was more focused on analyzing online sentiment from analysts and news blogs. Having Sonnet cite the exact sources established a **fact-based search approach** which I appreciated. The five sources it cited were all non-paywalled news blogs, so their validity were somewhat questionable.

[News Breakdown with citations](https://imgur.com/SmkoZIi)

**Part 2**  of the search was to gauge the general retail investor sentiment through socials like reddit and twitter. Since this is usually where I consume most of my investing content from, I thought it would be great to give Sonnet the same ability as well. The analysis it gave was a bit shallow on the social part, probably due to the overwhelming amounts of opinions available on Tesla, but still it was able to pick up reddit’s disdain for Elon, lol.

**Challenge 6 - Final Dashboard + Verdict on Tesla's Stock Price and Price Target**

For the final step of this report, Sonnet had to combine all its findings into one comprehensive dashboard with **visuals and analysis**. This part took the longest by far - around 40 seconds of waiting while it cranked out roughly 100 lines of code.

The dashboard successfully pulled together all the visuals created during our session, giving a solid overview of everything we'd discovered. Along with this, Sonnet delivered a detailed report **summarizing all the key findings from its research.**

While informative, the dashboard was a bit **cluttered**, especially in the overlay section at the bottom which was **hard to read**. But still it provided a well-reasoned verdict on Tesla's stock, pointing out its extraordinarily high forward P/E ratio compared to its growth relative to other automotive companies

**Final thoughts + Limitations**

It's also important to note that Tesla is such a unique stock given how much media and retail interest it gets. The financial metrics that would normally be considered highly relevant play less of a factor with TSLA. Online sentiment, Elon and Orange man’s tweets, and future growth potential seem to drive the stock more than traditional valuation metrics.

**Limiting hallucinations** through grounding LLMs in fact **(code, fact based corpus)** is a well known technique to maximize the value provided by the **Ai’s analytical abilities.** The results we got here was definitely **indicative** of that.

However, while more reliable, having access to so many tools does **drastically slow down** its production. This one prompt and the analysis that followed ran for **5-6 minutes** which is quite **high compared to other chat services (perplexity, chatgpt, claude.ai**). Running agentic workflows like this also cost a lot. Claude 3.7 sonnet is the one of the  most expensive non thinking models. This prompt cost us around 70 cents from start to finish.

As models progress, I hope to see the same quality output we see with Sonnet but with much faster throughput. I would love to test other models in the same environment and see how they perform. Google's most recent model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, boasts better mathematical and programming abilities than 3.7 Sonnet at a much faster throughput and at a fraction of the cost.

This was definitely a long post and I hope it was worth it for those who stuck through to the end. As a software engineer who dabbles decently in investing, it's gonna be interesting to see if AI can have the same level of impact in finance as it's had in the software industry. I definitely think that in the future, as **AI gets better and gains access to more and more tools,** conducting thorough stock research like this will become both better and more widely accessible.

I'd love to hear what you guys think of the analysis in this post, the good, the bad and the ugly, let me hear it all. Where you believe AI is headed in the investment research space. Are any of you already using AI to invest, if so how?

In some countries like Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands, they are down by aprox 60-70% in March 2025 compared to last year  (March 2024), even after Model Y changeover has finished.

In Norway, Tesla is once again the best seller, but it's still down by around 20% from March 2024, and the Q1 total is down around 30%.

There is currently no supply shortage, since you can order a new Model Y Juniper and get delivery almost the same day. The source for the numbers were taken from this website: [https://eu-evs.com/](https://eu-evs.com/)

One country had an increase in sales 25% (Spain).

Overall for the countries listed it was down est around 36%.

1. Having POTUS purchase a Tesla at the White House
2. Claiming that vandalizing Tesla cars/dealership is an act of terrorism
3. Consistently promoting Musk in every opportunity.

So you would be correct in thinking that those auto tariffs today will likely do everything they can to not affect Tesla.

HOWEVER, the above actions that I have indicated shows other world leaders that Tesla is very much a sensitive topic to both Trump and Musk. Meaning that even though the Trump administration might do everything they can to protect that company, world leaders will very likely target Tesla as much as possible as a negotiation tactic. 

Lastly, with TSLA earnings coming up, the more aggressive these world leaders are, the more likely the TSLA board will need to issue significant negative guidance due to being directly targeted.

1. These are HIGH ESTIMATES. 
2. This is based on all available sources and data that I was able to collect online, meaning if the online records are inaccurate, the estimate might be inaccurate. However, I did a thorough comparison analysis based on previous estimate models, and I stand by my projection.

# Tesla Q1 2025 Global Vehicle Deliveries Estimate

**TLDR**: We are estimating roughly 360,000 Tesla global deliveries, this is our high estimate based on the available information collected and assessed. Which would be a significant decline from last quarter and the quarter before that. 

# Introduction and Summary

Tesla’s vehicle deliveries in Q1 2025 are expected to decline year-over-year, marking a second consecutive Q1 drop. We estimate \~361,500 global deliveries for Q1 2025, down about 6.5% from 386,810 in Q1 2024. This is driven by a convergence of factors: a major Model Y production changeover, shifting shipping schedules, and challenging market conditions. By region, North America and China remain the largest contributors, while Europe’s deliveries have slumped markedly versus last year. The new Cybertruck is contributing a small volume (several thousand units) of initial deliveries in the U.S., but not enough to offset declines elsewhere. Figure 1 illustrates Tesla’s Q1 global deliveries trend over the past three years, highlighting the pullback in 2024 and 2025 relative to prior growth.

Data &amp; Methodology: This estimate uses open-source intelligence from government registration data, industry reports, and analyst tracking. We compiled country-level EV registration figures (where available) and official data (e.g. China’s CPCA sales, European new car registrations, etc.), then cross-checked against historical Tesla delivery patterns and production capacities. We broke down the estimate by country and by model (Model 3, Model Y, Model S, Model X, Cybertruck), using known splits from registration data and reasonable assumptions where official model splits are unavailable. All source data and assumptions are detailed in each region’s section.

# Global Delivery Estimate and Historical Context

We project \~361,500 Tesla vehicles delivered globally in Q1 2025. This would be Tesla’s weakest quarter in roughly two years, coming in below both Q1 2024 and Q1 2023 (Figure 1). It reflects an unusual pattern for Tesla, which until 2024 had never seen an annual decline in deliveries. In 2024, Tesla’s total deliveries fell \~1% – the first drop in its history – and Q1 2024 was down 8.5% from the prior year. Multiple factors contributed to the Q1 2025 slowdown:

* Production Transitions: Tesla began upgrading its factories for a revamped Model Y in early 2025, causing temporary production pauses. In Shanghai, Model Y lines were partially suspended for about three weeksaround the Lunar New Year for retooling. This reduced output in January-February. The Model 3 line was refreshed earlier (late 2024), so Model 3 production was less affected.
* Shipping and Delivery Timing: Tesla’s delivery volumes are typically back-loaded each quarter due to shipping logistics. In Q1 2025, this effect was exacerbated: exports were front-loaded and many deliveries slipped into late March, especially for Europe. (In Q1 2024, Tesla cited “shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict” as delaying some deliveries.) The result in Q1 2025 was very low reported registrations in January–February in many markets, with a partial catch-up in March.
* Market Conditions and Demand: Tesla faces intensified competition (especially in China’s “EV price war”) and some demand headwinds. In Europe, Tesla’s brand suffered from political controversies and reduced incentives, contributing to an estimated \~43% drop in Tesla’s EU sales YTD. Meanwhile, interest rate hikes and ample used Tesla inventory in the U.S. softened demand there. Tesla responded with price cuts and incentives, which support volume but compress margins.

Despite these challenges, it’s important to note that Q1 is seasonally Tesla’s slowest quarter, due to year-end sales pulls in Q4 and winter holiday effects. The Model Y refresh rollout is a temporary drag on Q1 deliveries: many customers delayed purchases awaiting the updated version, and Tesla deferred shipments until the new Model Y was ready. As new Model Y deliveries ramp up (starting late Q1 in China and Europe), Tesla’s volumes should recover in subsequent quarters. Analysts largely agree Q1 2025 will be a trough. In fact, Wall Street consensus for Q1 started around 464k but has been slashed to \~418k, and some analysts have cut estimates to the mid-350k range. JP Morgan, for example, revised Q1 to 355k and Guggenheim to 358k, citing weak January–February data. Our 361.5k estimate is in the same ballpark, reflecting a significant miss versus the early consensus and about a 7% decline year-on-year.

Below we detail the breakdown of this global forecast by region, country, and model, including the data points supporting each component. Figure 2 provides an overview of the regional and model mix for Q1 2025. North America and China dominate volumes, and the Model Y remains the top-selling model (though its share is reduced this quarter by the refresh timing).

Figure 2: Estimated Tesla Q1 2025 deliveries by region and model. North America (mostly USA) and China together account for \~76% of volume, with Europe about 15%. Model Y (orange) is still the largest contributor, but Model 3 (blue) gained share in Q1 2025 due to the Model Y production pause. Deliveries of Models S (green) and X (red) are modest, and Cybertruck (purple) contributes only a few thousand units in North America.

# United States (North America)

The United States remains Tesla’s largest market, but Q1 2025 U.S. deliveries are projected to fall year-over-year. We estimate about 130,000 Tesla deliveries in the U.S. (out of \~137k for North America including Canada). This is down from roughly \~150k in Q1 2024 (implied by Tesla’s global figures). U.S. registrations data show a weak start to 2025: in January, Tesla registrations were 43,411, down \~11% YoY. By the end of February, the U.S. shortfall had reportedly grown – Tesla had its worst monthly sales since July 2022 in Feb 2025. Analysts estimate U.S. deliveries in Jan–Feb were 4,000–5,000 units behind the prior year’s pace. This aligns with reports of a \~11% drop in Tesla’s January U.S. market share (42.5% of EVs, down from 54.5% a year prior). Other EV makers in the U.S. grew 44% in January, indicating Tesla lost some ground.

Factors in the U.S.: Part of the Q1 softness is supply-driven – Tesla prioritized overseas shipments early in Q1 and was transitioning to the new Model Y. Another factor is demand: Tesla’s continuous price cuts have spurred volume, but also led some buyers to wait for further drops. Additionally, CEO Elon Musk’s political involvement (e.g. as a Trump advisor) has sparked some protests and could be dampening sales for a subset of consumers. However, Tesla’s brand and EV market leadership remain strong in the U.S. – it still held 42.5% of the U.S. EV market in Jan 2025, far above any competitor.

U.S. Model Breakdown: Of the \~130k U.S. deliveries, we estimate roughly 70k are Model Y and \~40–45k are Model 3. The Model Y typically outsells the Model 3 in the U.S. by a wide margin (it was the best-selling vehicle in the world in 2023). In early 2025 that gap likely narrowed because Model Y inventory was constrained by the factory retooling, while the refreshed Model 3 was readily available. Industry data hint at this shift: In February, the Model 3 actually outsold the Model Y in some markets like the UK, suggesting the Model 3’s refresh boosted its appeal. We anticipate a similar dynamic in the U.S. (though exact figures aren’t published monthly). Model S and X deliveries are relatively small – on the order of 10,000 combined in the U.S. (Tesla does not break these out by country, but globally S/X will be \~18k units). The Cybertruck finally contributes meaningfully this quarter, with an estimated 7,000deliveries in the U.S. Tesla delivered the first Cybertrucks to customers in late 2024, and is now slowly ramping production in Texas. These Q1 2025 Cybertruck deliveries are likely mostly employees and early reservation holders in North America.

**Canada**: In Canada (included in North America in Figure 2), we estimate about 8,000 deliveries (mostly Model Y and 3). Canada’s EV sales data for Q1 2025 aren’t fully reported yet, but Tesla typically captures a large share of the Canadian EV market. For example, in 2024 Tesla sold \~50,000 vehicles in Canada (we infer \~10k–12k per quarter on average). Q1 2025 should be somewhat lower given the U.S. trends and winter seasonality, so \~8k is a reasonable estimate.

**China** is Tesla’s second-largest market and production hub. We estimate Tesla delivered around 125,000 vehicles to Chinese customers in Q1 2025. This is slightly lower than last year (Q1 2024 domestic deliveries were 132,420) – a drop of roughly 5%. Tesla’s sales in China were heavily impacted by the Model Y line upgrade and the Chinese New Year timing this quarter.

**Official Data**: According to the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), Tesla’s domestic retail sales in China in Jan–Feb 2025 were 60,480 units, down 13.6% year-on-year. January saw \~33.7k retail sales and February \~26.8k, both below year-ago levels as production was curtailed and the week-long New Year holiday fell in late Jan. However, by late February Tesla began deliveries of the refreshed Model Y in China, which boosted March sales. Industry sources noted Tesla’s China registrations picked up significantly once the new Model Y reached showrooms. We anticipate March domestic sales on par with or slightly above last year’s (for reference, Tesla sold 62,398 vehicles in China in Mar 2024 after the previous Model 3 refresh). This late-quarter surge should narrow the YTD gap to only a few thousand units. Indeed, as of mid-March analysts said Tesla was \~7k units behind its prior-year pace in China, implying a much smaller YoY decline by quarter’s end.

**Export vs Domestic**: It’s important to distinguish Tesla’s China production from deliveries to Chinese consumers. Giga Shanghai produces cars both for local sale and for export. In Q1 2025, 93,926 Shanghai-built Teslas were shipped in Jan–Feb (domestic + export), down 28.7% YoY. Much of that decline was in exports: Shanghai’s exports in the first two months (33,446 units) were down 45.9% from last year. This suggests Tesla allocated a higher share of Shanghai production to the domestic market (likely to support the Model 3 Highland launch and because Giga Berlin is handling more of Europe’s supply). Tesla’s China domestic deliveries are therefore not down as steeply as the production figure. Through February, domestic sales were only \~9,500 units lower than 2024, and March domestic sales likely closed much of that gap. Our \~125k China estimate assumes a strong March on the back of the new Model Y and sustained Model 3 demand after its late-2024 facelift.

**China Model Split**: Tesla Shanghai produces Model 3 and Model Y. The Model Y has been Tesla’s bestseller in China, but the production pause means Model Y sales dipped this quarter. In Jan–Feb, Model Y volume was significantly reduced (the factory upgrades reportedly cut output by \~50% for several weeks). The Model 3 (refreshed version) likely formed a larger share of sales than usual. We estimate of the \~125k China deliveries, roughly 70k (56%) are Model Y and \~55k (44%) are Model 3. By comparison, in March 2024, Model Y was \~65% of Tesla’s China-made sales. The Model S/X are only imported in very small numbers to China – a few hundred units per quarter – and we include those in “Other” in our table (negligible in the China total). Essentially, Tesla China’s Q1 2025 sales were all Model 3/Y, with Model Y picking up in late March after the relaunch. Tesla faced intense competition in China’s EV market during this period, with domestic brands like BYD surging &gt;90%. Tesla’s market share in China’s BEV segment was around 6.3% in Feb, down from over 10% last year, due to these competitive pressures and its own supply hiccups. Tesla responded by cutting prices (e.g. in January it slashed Model Y Long Range price by ¥20k) and upgrading Autopilot features to entice buyers. These moves, along with the new Model Y, helped Tesla China buck the global trend in 2024 with an 8.8% sales increase to 657k units, and should support its Q1 2025 finish despite the slow start.

# Europe

Tesla’s deliveries in Europe saw a significant drop in early 2025. We estimate about 54,000 Tesla deliveries in Europe (EU + UK + EFTA) in Q1 2025, which is sharply lower than Q1 2024 (when we estimate \~75–80k were delivered). Official registration data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) show Tesla’s new registrations in the EU (excluding UK/EFTA) were 19,046 in Jan–Feb 2025, down 49% year-on-year. Including the UK and EFTA countries (Norway, Switzerland, etc.), Tesla delivered 26,619 vehicles in Europe in the first two months, 42.6% less than the 46,343 in Jan–Feb 2024. In other words, Tesla was over 20,000 units behind its prior-year European pace by end of February. This shortfall came from a combination of demand issues (negative brand sentiment, reduced incentives) and delivery timing (fewer cars allocated to Europe early in Q1 due to factory upgrades).

**Key Country Trends:**

* **Germany**: Tesla’s largest European market experienced a collapse in reported sales for Jan–Feb. German KBA data showed Tesla registrations of just 1,277 units in January 2025, down \~60% YoY, and 1,429 in February, down 76%. These are extraordinarily low (Tesla had over 6,900 registrations in Feb 2024, for example). Part of this is timing – Giga Berlin (which supplies Model Y to Europe) had downtime in early Q1, and Tesla delivered almost no cars until the end of the quarter. Also, Germany ended certain EV incentives, causing a pull-forward into late 2024 and a Q1 slump. We expect a bounce in March as Tesla delivers cars produced earlier and ships in more Model 3s from Shanghai. Still, Q1 Germany deliveries will be far below last year. We estimate \~10,000 in Q1 (versus \~17k in Q1 2024), with Model Y \~5k and Model 3 \~5k. Notably, some of the meager Jan–Feb German registrations were likely Model 3s (shipped from Shanghai) because local Model Y production was offline. Tesla’s market share in Germany fell to about 2% of EV sales in Feb (1,429 out of \~35,949 EVs). German media have partially blamed Elon Musk’s support of controversial political figures for turning off buyers, though Tesla attributes it largely to the Model Y changeover.
* **Norway**: Once Tesla’s showcase market, Norway also saw steep declines. Tesla sold 1,606 cars in Norway in Jan–Feb 2025, down 44% from 2,887 a year earlier. Tesla’s market share in Norway plummeted from 21.7% in Jan 2024 to just 7.4% in Jan 2025. In fact, through Feb, Toyota (with one EV model) outsold Tesla in Norway. This is partly because Tesla had very few Model Y deliveries early in Q1 (likely waiting for the new version). Indeed, in March Tesla registrations in Norway began to rebound as the refreshed Model Y arrived (over 1,000 Model Ys were registered in March, putting Tesla back on top for that month). For Q1 as a whole, we estimate Norway at \~3,000 deliveries (down from \~5–6k a year ago). The Model Y should still be the top Tesla model in Norway (\~1.5–2k units) with the Model 3 making up the rest. Tesla’s decline in Norway reflects both the supply issue and increased competition in a nearly saturated EV market (96% of new cars are now EVs).
* **France**: Tesla’s sales decline in France has been more moderate. In February 2025, Tesla registered 2,395 vehicles in France, 26% fewer than Feb 2024. This was in a market where overall EV sales held steady \~18% share. The drop was likely concentrated in Model Y (many French customers waited for the new Model Y, or opted for alternatives). French officials noted a “redistribution” toward European EV models in early 2025, benefitting Renault, Peugeot, etc., at Tesla’s expense. For Q1, we project Tesla France around 8,000 deliveries (vs \~10k in Q1 2024). The Model Y should account for \~5k and Model 3 \~3k of those. France still had incentives in place that help EV sales generally, but Tesla’s imported cars don’t qualify for certain EU-local subsidies (giving an edge to European brands).
* **United Kingdom**: In contrast to mainland Europe, the UK saw Tesla sales rise in early 2025. Nearly 4,000 Teslas were sold in the UK in February, up 20.7% year-on-year. The Model 3 and Model Y were the #2 and #3 best-selling cars overall in Feb (behind only the Mini Cooper EV), with \~1,990 Model 3 and \~1,861 Model Y registrations. Tesla’s UK market share climbed to 4.6% of all new cars in Feb. This divergence is due to a few factors: First, UK buyers only recently got the Model 3 refresh (so there was pent-up demand in early 2024 that’s being realized now). Second, UK EV sales are surging ahead of a new luxury car tax from April 2025 that will impose fees on expensive EVs – Tesla buyers rushed to get vehicles before this tax. Also, the UK was not directly affected by Musk’s political controversies in the way some EU markets were (the UK auto industry body SMMT even highlighted Tesla’s growth vs. the 40% slump in Europe). We estimate \~13,000 Tesla deliveries in the UK in Q1 2025, a substantial increase from \~10k in Q1 2024. March is typically the biggest month in the UK (new registration plates are issued), so we expect a major chunk of Q1 deliveries occurred in late March. The Model Y and Model 3 should be relatively balanced in the UK mix (in Feb they were roughly equal).
* **Other Europe**: Other key markets include the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Italy, and Spain. Many followed the broader trend of weak Jan–Feb and a March catch-up. For instance, in Sweden and Denmark, local reports noted Tesla sales “plummeted” in Jan–Feb 2025, similar to Norway. We aggregate these into “Rest of Europe” (\~20k Q1 deliveries in total). The Netherlands likely saw a few thousand Teslas – it’s an end-of-quarter heavy market. Switzerland (an EFTA country) might be \~1,000–2,000 (it had 1,364 Teslas in Q1 2024 per industry data). Italy and Spain have lower volumes (hundreds per month). Across these markets, the Model 3 took a larger share than usual in early 2025, since Model Y availability was constrained. We assume the rest-of-Europe split is roughly 55% Model 3, 30% Model Y, and 15% combined S/X. Tesla does ship some S/X to Europe – we estimate \~3,000 Model S and \~2,000 Model X across Europe in Q1 (mainly to countries like Germany, Norway, UK where there’s some demand for premium models).

**European Factory Output**: It’s worth noting that Tesla’s Gigafactory Berlin was producing up to 5,000 Model Y per week at peak in 2023, so it could have supplied \~60k Model Y in Q1 under ideal conditions. However, in Q1 2025 Berlin output was likely far lower due to the line upgrades (potentially to introduce a revised Model Y “Project Juniper”) and even a temporary shutdown in January amid a workers’ strike and an arson incident in late 2024. Some reports even mentioned Tesla “closing a factory in Germany” for modernization – referring to the brief pause. This constrained supply to Europe. Tesla did not significantly compensate by exporting more from Shanghai (since Shanghai’s own Model Y line was being upgraded too). Hence the unusually low deliveries. By late Q1, Berlin probably resumed production of the updated Model Y, which will improve European deliveries going forward.

In summary, we see Europe accounting for only \~15% of Tesla’s global deliveries in Q1 2025, down from about 20% a year prior. Tesla’s market share in Europe fell to \~1.1% of new car sales in early 2025. Figure 2 (above) shows Europe’s small contribution relative to North America and China this quarter. Tesla will be looking to bounce back in Europe in Q2 as new models arrive and some demand presumably deferred from Q1 materializes.

# Other Regions (Asia-Pacific &amp; Others)

Outside of the U.S., China, and Europe, Tesla has a growing presence in other markets – notably Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and the Middle East. In total, these “rest of world” markets make up roughly 9–10% of Q1 deliveries (\~32k units in our estimate). Key highlights:

* **Canada**: Covered in the North America section, Canada contributes \~8k (mostly Model Y).
* **Australia**: Tesla continues to lead Australia’s EV market, but sales have dipped from record highs. In February 2025, Tesla sold 1,592 cars in Australia (924 Model Y and 668 Model 3). This was down from Tesla’s phenomenal Feb 2023 (when early Model 3 refresh demand drove 2,671 Model 3s in one month). Year-to-date, Australia’s EV registrations in Jan–Feb 2025 (\~9,516 across all brands) significantly lag 2024 (\~15,000), and Tesla “remains well below 2023 numbers” there. We estimate Tesla delivered about 2,500 vehicles in Australia in Q1 2025. March should have been relatively low because Tesla’s shipment schedule to Australia often results in deliveries peaking mid-quarter. The Model Y is the top seller (taking 924 sales in Feb, versus 465 in Jan). The Model 3 had 274 in Jan and 668 in Feb. These figures confirm Tesla’s dominance in Australia’s EV rankings (Model Y and 3 were #1 and #2 in Feb), but also the big year-on-year drop due to the previous year’s Model 3 launch and perhaps some antipathy toward Musk (Australian EV associations have cited Musk’s image as a factor).
* **Other Asia-Pacific:** Tesla sells thousands of cars in South Korea, Japan, and other Asian markets. Giga Shanghai exports right-hand-drive Model 3/Y to places like Japan, and left-hand-drive to Korea, etc. In South Korea, Tesla had cut prices which boosted demand in late 2024; we expect a few thousand deliveries there in Q1 2025. Japan likely saw a modest increase with the cheaper Model 3 Highland – perhaps on the order of 1,000 units in Q1 (Tesla sold \~5,000 in all of 2024 in Japan, per local reports). Taiwan and Hong Kong are smaller markets but with some Tesla presence. Summing up Asia-Pacific (ex-China/Australia), we estimate around 10,000 deliveries. These would be predominantly Model 3 and Model Y. Tesla’s brand in these regions hasn’t faced the same political issues as in Europe; sales mostly depend on logistics and local incentives.
* **Middle East**: Tesla has been expanding in the Middle East (e.g. opening showrooms in the UAE and Israel). Volumes remain relatively low – a few hundred to low thousands per quarter region-wide. For instance, Israel imported many Teslas in 2021–2022; by 2025 quarterly numbers might be \~1,000. The UAE and other Gulf states could add a similar figure. We include Middle East/Africa in our “Other” category, roughly \~2,000–3,000 combined.
* **Latin America:** Tesla officially entered some Latin American markets (like Mexico, where Giga Monterrey is planned, and also sells in Brazil, etc.). These are nascent markets for Tesla. Q1 2025 deliveries in LatAm are likely only a few hundred (Mexico) to low hundreds (Brazil, where some Model Ys were shipped). We include these in “Other.”

Overall, these other regions are not individually large, but collectively they contribute a notable chunk of Tesla’s growth and help absorb Shanghai’s output. In Q1 2025, however, many of these markets also saw slower Tesla sales compared to a year prior, either due to high 2024 comps or shipping schedules. For example, Tesla’s sales in Asia (ex-China) and Oceania were down year-on-year according to shipping data and local reports, echoing the global trend.

# Detailed Breakdown by Country and Model

The following table presents our Q1 2025 delivery estimates by country and model, aggregating the analysis above. We include the five Tesla models currently in production: Model 3, Model Y, Model S, Model X, and the new Cybertruck. These figures are informed by the data points discussed (registrations, shipment reports, historical splits) and adjusted to ensure consistency with the global total. Each country entry represents vehicles delivered to customers in that country during Q1 2025.

|Country/Region|Model 3|Model Y|Model S|Model X|Cybertruck|Total Q1 2025|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|United States|45,000|75,000|5,000|5,000|7,000|137,000|
|China|55,000|75,000|0|0|0|130,000|
|United Kingdom|5,000|8,000|0|0|0|13,000|
|Germany|5,000|5,000|0|0|0|10,000|
|France|3,000|5,000|0|0|0|8,000|
|Norway|1,500|1,500|0|0|0|3,000|
|Rest of Europe (other EU/EFTA)|11,000|6,000|2,000|1,000|0|20,000|
|Canada|3,000|5,000|0|0|0|8,000|
|Australia|1,000|1,500|0|0|0|2,500|
|Rest of World (Asia, ME, LatAm)|10,000|15,000|3,000|2,000|0|30,000|
|Global Total|139,500|197,000|10,000|8,000|7,000|361,500|

Table Notes: These figures are HIGH estimates rounded to the nearest 500–1,000. “Rest of Europe” includes markets like the Netherlands, Sweden, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, etc., and assumes a handful of S/X deliveries in those countries. “Rest of World” encompasses all other markets (Asia-Pacific ex. China/Australia, Middle East, Latin America, Africa). The global total \~361,500 is the sum of all countries and is roughly 6–7% below Q1 2024’s actual 386,810.

A few observations from the breakdown: Model Y is the top model in every major region except possibly Norway (where Model 3 nearly matched it). Model Y and Model 3 combined make up about 93% of deliveries – Tesla remains heavily reliant on its two mass-market models. The Model S and X are niche, together &lt;5% of volume, which aligns with Tesla’s official mix in recent quarters (for example, S/X were \~4.4% of deliveries in Q1 2024). The Cybertruck, while highly anticipated, contributes only \~2% of Q1 volume in this estimate. Its production ramp will likely accelerate in late 2025.

# Alignment with Production and Historical Trends

Our estimated 361.5k deliveries should be viewed in context of Tesla’s production capacity and typical quarterly patterns. Tesla likely produced slightly more than this in Q1 (leading to a small inventory build), as it did in Q1 2024. In Q1 2024, production was 440,808 and deliveries 386,810, indicating \~54k inventory increase – attributed to vehicles in transit due to logistical delays. In Q1 2025, we expect production on the order of 380k–390k (the factory upgrades meant output was not at full capacity). That would again outpace deliveries by a few percent, meaning Tesla’s inventory (vehicles in transit or unsold) might grow slightly. This is consistent with Tesla’s strategy of smoothing deliveries and the Q1 logistical challenges.

Historically, Q1 is \~10–20% lower than Q4 for Tesla due to seasonality. Q4 2024 deliveries were 495,570. A drop to \~361.5k in Q1 2025 is a **27% sequential decline**, bigger than usual. Part of that is the Q4 2024 push (Tesla had a year-end incentive campaign that pulled some demand into December 2024), and part is the unique Q1 2025 production downtime. We expect Tesla’s deliveries to rebound in Q2 2025 as the factory upgrades translate into higher output(e.g. Giga Shanghai’s new Model Y lines and Giga Berlin’s improvements). Tesla’s full-year target for 2025 is reportedly \~1.79 million deliveries, which would require significant growth in later quarters after this soft Q1.

In terms of model trends, the Model Y’s transition depressed its Q1 volumes, but it’s worth noting Tesla’s own claim that the Model Y became the world’s best-selling vehicle (of any kind) in 2023. The refresh (often called “Model Y Project Juniper”) involves design and feature updates that should make the Model Y even more popular. Thus, the Q1 dip in Model Y is likely temporary. The Model 3 “Highland” refresh, on the other hand, has been fully rolled out, and it helped keep Model 3 sales relatively robust in Q1 2025 (even growing in some markets like the UK). This dynamic – Model 3 up, Model Y down – is a reversal of the usual pattern and unique to this quarter.

On the geographical mix, Tesla’s shift is evident: China and the U.S. are taking on a larger share of deliveries, while Europe shrinks this quarter. In Q1 2024, China was about 34% of deliveries and Europe \~20%. In Q1 2025, we estimate China is \~36% and Europe \~15%. This was not a strategic reallocation so much as a consequence of the issues discussed. We anticipate Europe’s share will recover somewhat later in 2025 with the new Model Y and potentially the introduction of the Tesla Model 2/“Compact” (if it’s unveiled for Europe or China late in the year, as rumors suggest). For now, Tesla’s heavy reliance on the U.S. and China means macroeconomic or policy changes in those markets (like interest rates or EV incentives) have outsized impact on Tesla’s overall deliveries.

Finally, it’s notable that analyst consensus and tracking estimates converged near our figure by late March 2025. For instance, the EV publication Electrek reported that available data pointed to \~356,000 deliveries if Tesla didn’t catch up by end of March. Some analyst forecasts in the last week of March were in the mid-350k range. Our breakdown of 361.5k assumes Tesla managed to close part of the gap in the final weeks (especially in China and Europe with the new Model Y shipments). If Tesla’s end-of-quarter push was slightly weaker, the number could end up closer to 350k. On the optimistic side, if Tesla somehow delivered every vehicle produced and then some, the upper bound is around 380k (which would still be a YoY decline). However, given all the evidence, a result around 360k ± 5k is the most likely. This lines up with independent delivery trackers and represents a considerable miss vs. initial expectations (418k), but one that can be explained by the one-off operational factors detailed above rather than a permanent collapse in demand.

To summarize it all. The estimated 361,500 global deliveries reflects significant pain (factory upgrades, model changeovers, logistics, sentiment) and some demand challenges. Country-level data from the U.S., China, and Europe all reinforce the narrative of a weak Jan–Feb followed by a late-March recovery. As Tesla’s new production capacity comes online and as pricing/incentives stabilize demand, Tesla will aim to resume growth after this dip but this will maintain to be significantly challenging. The breakdown by country and model provided here offers a granular look at where Tesla’s deliveries came from in Q1 2025, and sets a baseline to measure its progress in the coming quarters.

2025-03-25 23:14:10,r/stocks,Stocks Close Higher for 3rd Straight Day; Tesla Surges in Late Trading to Extend Rally,"
Major indexes closed slightly higher Tuesday as the stock market continued its recovery from an extended selloff.

The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose fractionally. Stocks had kicked off the week with big gains following news that President Trump could scale back some of the tariffs that are due to be imposed next week on U.S. trading partners. With the recent gains, the Dow has inched back into positive territory for 2025, as stocks have rebounded from a month-long selloff spurred by concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.

Investors brushed off consumer confidence data released this morning that came in weaker than expected, with the index hitting its lowest level in more than four years. Investors are closing watching all data points amid worries that tariffs could reignite inflation and cause economic growth to stall. The big economic report of the week comes Friday with the scheduled release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had fallen during the recent stock market rout amid the growing concerns about the economy, was at 4.32% in late trading, down from 4.33% at yesterday's close and from an earlier high Tuesday of 4.37%. The yield, which affects costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, hit its highest level in more than a month this morning.

Mega-cap technology stocks, which helped lead Monday's rally, were mostly higher again today. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied late in the day to finish 3.5% higher, gaining ground for the 5th consecutive session, despite news Tuesday that the EV maker's sales in Europe continued to slide. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) each rose more than 1%, while Microsoft (MSFT) inched ahead. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) closed slightly lower

Tesla is the biggest component of Wood’s flagship ARK Innovation (NYSE:[ARKK](https://www.investing.com/etfs/ark-innovation)) exchange-traded fund, which holds about $646 million worth of shares in the EV maker. Tesla is also by far Ark’s biggest holding across its other ETFs, according to data from Cathie’s Ark. 

Tesla is trading down nearly 27% so far in 2025, having lost as much as 50% of its value since November.

2025-03-24 14:22:25,r/stocks,"Volkswagen, BMW group electric cars outsell Tesla in Europe in February","(Reuters) - Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) EV sales in Europe have fallen in February behind legacy brand Volkswagen ([VOW3.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VOW3.DE), [VLKPF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VLKPF)) and the BMW ([BMW.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BMW.DE)) group, as well as rivals from China, data by research platform JATO Dynamics showed on Monday.

Elon Musk's all-electric brand is facing a loyalty test in Europe after the close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump openly supported far-right parties in the continent, including with at least two dozen posts on his X platform promoting Germany's Alternative fur Deutschland.

Musk's role in politics, rising competition in the EV market and the phasing out of the existing version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y, have all impacted sales, Felipe Munoz, Global Analyst at JATO Dynamics, said in a report.

""Brands like Tesla, which have a relatively limited model lineup, are particularly vulnerable to registration declines when undertaking a model changeover,"" Munoz said.

Tesla's battery-electric vehicle (BEV) registrations in 25 European Union markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland fell on average by 44% from the same month of 2024, to under 16,000 cars sold in February. Its market share in the month fell to 9.6%, the lowest February reading in the last five years.

By comparison, Volkswagen's BEV sales were up 180% to under 20,000 cars, while the BMW brand and BMW-owned Mini, combined, sold almost 19,000 BEVs in February, the data showed.

Chinese-owned brands, combined, also sold more electric cars than Tesla, JATO Dynamics said.

BYD's ([1211.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/1211.HK), [BYDDY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYDDY)) and Polestar's ([PSNY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PSNY)) BEV sales in the same markets were up respectively 94% and 84% to over 4,000 and over 2,000 cars. Xpeng ([XPEV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XPEV), [9868.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9868.HK)) sold over 1,000 cars and Leapmotor ([9863.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9863.HK)) almost 900.

BEV sales at Geely ([0175.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/0175.HK), [GELYF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GELYF)) -owned Volvo and SAIC ([600104.SS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/600104.SS))-owned MG, instead, dropped by 30% and 67% respectively, the data showed.

Total car sales in 25 European Union markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland dropped by 3% to 0.97 million in February, while BEV registrations were up by 25%.

This has resulted in a market bounce and overall means that markets will likely NOT be as impacted by tariffs as they were expecting. 

The tariff game Trump is playing reminds me of that scene from the office: ""You have no idea the physical toll three vasectomies have on a person! Snip Snap! Snip Snap! Snip Snap!"" -Michael Scott. 

Anyway back to the watchlist. 

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d)\- Seen a significant bounce in TSLA due to the news of the lessened (supposedly) future tariffs—interested in seeing if we can break above $260 at open; otherwise, not interested and likely still will be negatively biased. This might actually be reacting a little positively due to BYD's blowout earnings. BYD reported $107B annual revenue for the year and are close to TSLA's profit! Mainly concerned in the long run about margin compression due to pricing cuts, increased competition in the EV space, macro headwinds, and of course, Elon making fork sculptures in the White House but no one appreciating them. 

[**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&amp;p=d)\- MicroStrategy buys 6,911 more of the underlying, now holds over 506k, currently at 2x premium. Nothing too interesting to note beyond the typical upwards move from whenever MSTR announces a buy of the underlying. We've bounced slightly off the lows, but worth noting that the underlying is also rose from news that Trump might use his gold holdings to buy more. I always keep in mind MSTR's heavy dependence on underlying performance, regulatory scrutiny, and volatility, of course. Related tickers to watch on this are RIOT and COIN/HOOD.

[**LUNR (Intuitive Machines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LUNR&amp;p=d)\- Reported strong Q4 and FY24 results. Q4 revenue of $54.7M (+80% YoY) and FY24 revenue of $228.0M (nearly 3x YoY).

Backlog reached $328.3M (+22% YoY), with **projected positive run-rate Adj. EBITDA by year-end**. Overall backlog seemed to be the second most important factor, signifies that there is future revenue and they are far more financially stable than anticipated and even profitable by year end! I have a very small position long. Going to bail if we break below $7 but overall I think there are many tailwinds that can help LUNR. **L**UNR's main risks are execution risk tied to lunar missions (beginning of this month saw the stock fall close to 50% in a single day), contract delays, reliance on government funding, and high R&amp;D intensity with limited margin buffer/no defined return. Also watching RKLB on this. 

[**AZEK (The AZEK Company)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AZEK&amp;p=d)\- James Hardie to acquire AZEK in a cash/stock deal valued at $8.75B (including debt). AZEK holders to receive $26.45 cash + 1.034 JHX shares, totaling \~$53/share (as of premarket prices)**.** These hybrid stock/cash acquisitions can fluctuate in price because of how the acquirer pays with their own stock. Typical M&amp;A risks apply such as integration risk, housing market softness, FX exposure (James Hardie also trades in Australia IIRC), regulatory risk, etc.

BEIJING, March 24 (Reuters) - Tesla [(TSLA.O),](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TSLA.O) said on Monday it would release its smart driving-assistance feature in China after completing regulatory approval, following complaints that a limited-time free trial of its Full Self-Driving service had been temporarily paused.""All parties are actively advancing the relevant process and we will push it to you as soon as it is ready.

2025-03-23 15:35:01,r/stocks,"Tariffs, DOGE and Columbia — The market will crash because Trumpism is not capitalism","There is a lot of talk, in this subreddit and just about everywhere, about how the tariffs are going to affect stock prices. I think the bigger factor is that Trumpism is not capitalism. This government has asserted its right to cancel contracts and grants, and the right to use all means at its disposal to impose policy on non-government entities. One example: NIH grants have been canceled because they were interpreted (apparently by someone who probably did not even read them, and certainly doesn’t understand them) as being no longer in line with the priorities of this government. These are multimillion dollar projects on topics like cancer, autism and shingles. They were funded after a careful competitive review by scientists, and they were stopped after much of the money was spent. It’s half-finished bridges. You can no doubt provide many examples yourself. If you can’t, ask in the comments. My point here is that under Trumpism the government will abandon contracts at will, and will use the threat of cancellation to micromanage state and local government, and corporations. 

The cases of Columbia and Maine illustrate that this government has replaced the rule of law with rule by one man. In both cases, Trump asserted the right to dictate policy normally left to the University (regarding the limits of free speech on campus) or to the state (regarding trans-gender athletes), and found ways to enforce that. I don’t yet know of a case where this government directly managed a company, but I’m sure it will come; he has the tools (the threat of cancellation of government contracts, or exemptions from tariffs, to name two). The threat of arbitrary and capricious directives from this government, coupled with the inability to rely on contracts being honored, is going to destroy profits. Milton Friedman, the famed Chicago school economist, argued that democracy, economic freedom and the rule of law are essential for prosperity. We no longer have those things. Let me give you three examples. 

I have significant holdings in MRNA, Moderna. Their mRNA technology allows the rapid development of custom drugs, not only vaccines, but drugs to treat cancer and many other diseases. They demonstrated that they can deliver during the covid-19 pandemic, and many estimates hold that RNA vaccines saved over 10 million lives. This is a great American company, and it should be ascendent, but its stock price is currently beaten down by the reasonable expectation of politically based resistance to mRNA vaccines from the Trump administration. 

TSLA was one of last year’s magnificent seven and rose even higher when Trump was elected because of the expectation that the CEO Elon Musk’s close personal relationship with the president would pay off. Now, it has fallen along with Musk’s popularity. People realize that DOGE found precious little waste and fraud but compromised many valued functions of government. To my point here, the value of TSLA stock is entirely dependent on Trump’s continued favor. If there are many government contracts, it will probably recover. If there is a falling out after Trump finally finds it necessary to blame Musk for the obvious problems with DOGE, then it will not. In either case, this is not a free market. 

Finally, I want to mention Boeing. Trump personally announced on Friday that Boeing had been selected to build the F-47 jet fighter, a contract potentially worth $50 billion. So far so good, but he’s making it clear that he decides. I expect this contract to specify everything from who Boeing can purchase parts from, to DEI policies, to whether someone given the name Charles at birth can go by Chuck. 

Trumpism is government regulation on steroids.   ",3501,840,30030s,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ji0n3r/tariffs_doge_and_columbia_the_market_will_crash/,1ji0n3r

My question, “Should I pull out of at least my M7 (already cashed out TSLA) from the market to cash and reenter well after April 6th?”  So at this point I’m up on all my long term stocks ranging from 39% to 167% as I’ve been is a long time. So nothing would be at a loss. I just feel we are facing a man made intentional potential crash of US stocks. Could be short term or long term. One issue, I’m also near retirement age so I don’t have 20 years to wait for a correction. 
Let me further say all my eggs are not in one basket. I’m fully diversified with only 1/3 of my liquid assets in stock. Because of my age 2/3 is in very safe such as CD’s near 5%. Also 2 houses paid off, nice car paid off, zero debt on credit cards paid off monthly. 
But I can’t make a misstep. My portfolio will be 1/2 of the income I will rely on for income in a few years. 


I know we are not supposed to make rash decisions based on “feelings” but it’s more than that, I’m reading nonstop everything about this market and as an older person I feel like I’m seeing a potential 2008 all over again. I wisely went cash then. And in 2010 bought my house for only  42% of it was valued in 2006. Now it’s worth 5 times what I paid for it.

2025-03-21 01:54:15,r/stocks,Short sellers have made $15 billion betting against Tesla and Nvidia in 2025,"Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Tesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven — which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) — is underperforming the S&amp;P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

Now, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.

""Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,"" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. ""But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market. They are not going away.""

2025-03-21 01:51:05,r/stocks,Exclusive-Tesla trade-ins on pace for record high amid Musk backlash,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Motorists have traded in a record number of Tesla (TSLA) electric vehicles this month, Edmunds data showed, amid a wave of protests against CEO Elon Musk's work as an adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump.

Tesla cars from model year 2017 or newer accounted for 1.4% of all the vehicles traded in until March 15, up from 0.4% in March last year, according to data provided to Reuters by Edmunds. Analysts at the national car shopping website said that share could grow through the second half of the month.

In February, the Trump administration's first full month, Teslas made up 1.2% of vehicles traded in.

March's trade-ins so far would be the highest monthly share Edmunds has on record of Tesla trade-ins toward new or used purchases at dealerships, if the trend continues. This excludes trade-ins toward new purchases of Teslas and EVs from other direct-to-consumer brands.

Musk is leading the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency and activists across the U.S. have staged so-called Tesla Takedown demonstrations over his role in cuts to the federal workforce and cancellation of contracts that fund global humanitarian programs.

Social media has been rife with posts from Tesla owners in the U.S. and some European countries showing them giving up their vehicles in displays of anger toward Musk.

The March data on Tesla trade-ins has not been previously reported.

""Brand loyalty is becoming a bigger question mark as factors such as Elon Musk's increasing public involvement in government, Tesla depreciation concerns and its increased saturation in major metro areas leave some longtime owners feeling disconnected from the brand,"" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' head of insights.

Spokespersons for Tesla and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Tesla has said it expects the vehicle business to return to growth this year, after a small drop in 2024.

Prices of used Teslas have dropped in line with other EVs from Ford, Kia and Hyundai, according to Edmunds.

Used Tesla prices will likely decline further as Tesla trade-ins that are undergoing reconditioning reach the market, Edmunds analysts said.

Anger against the brand has resulted in Tesla vehicles being set on fire and damage to the company's showrooms and charging stations.

Trump has said he would label such attacks as domestic terrorism.

Tesla stock, which skyrocketed since Trump's election in November on hopes it would be easier for the company to roll out robotaxis under the new administration, has nearly halved from its January peak.

Fred McKinney, a corporate consultant, traded in his 2018 Tesla Model 3 last month to show his disapproval of Musk.

""I thought about putting a bumper sticker on my car saying, 'I hate Musk.' But selling the car feels so much better,"" he said on a LinkedIn post. ""If you are considering a new EV, under no circumstances consider buying a Tesla.""

Data from Edmunds also showed shoppers' consideration of new Teslas dropped to 1.8% last month - the lowest level since October 2022 - after peaking at 3.3% in November.

Tesla's sales likely fell 10% in February, hurt by declines in its Cybertruck pickup, Model 3 sedan, and Model Y SUV, separate estimates from market research firm Cox Automotive showed on Thursday.

""These shifts in Tesla consumer sentiment could create an opportunity for legacy automakers and EV startups to gain ground,"" Caldwell said.

""As Tesla brand loyalty and interest waver, those offering competitive pricing, new technology, or simply less controversy could capture defecting Tesla owners and first-time EV buyers.""

There's a lot of backstory to the narrative of Chinese stocks- we've seen the Chinese government try to inject stimulus into the economy, the US has tried to end the de minimis rule, China's trying to encourage more business (remember the meeting of Xi/business leaders), etc. Overall China is trying to let the private sector operate a little more freely to stave off an economic downturn. PDD owns Temu, which is likely to be a loser of the de minimis rule if it gets ended.

2025-03-20 07:08:52,r/stocks,A Deeper Dive on Trump's Tariffs and Market Positioning,"Trump’s latest trade policies are hammering the markets—S&amp;P 500 down \~9%, Nasdaq off \~12%—and it looks like he’s doubling down. Tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU are back on the table, with zero indication that he’s backing down. While some sectors (steel, domestic manufacturing) stand to benefit, others (tech, autos, multinational retailers) are getting crushed. The question is: at what point does the market pain force Trump to change course?

The **2025 Trade Policy Agenda** lays out his vision:

✅ **Tariffs as leverage** – forcing trade partners into more “reciprocal” deals

✅ **USMCA review (2026)** – questioning whether Canada &amp; Mexico are benefiting unfairly

✅ **Hardline stance on China** – blaming it for the U.S. trade deficit and pushing for stricter enforcement of trade agreements

His strategy? **Drive U.S. production up, cut reliance on imports, and force foreign partners to play by his rules.** But markets are worried about **inflation, supply chain disruption, and retaliatory tariffs**—all of which are starting to bite.

Not every company is hurting—some stand to **benefit significantly** from Trump’s protectionist approach. Trump’s tariffs **shield domestic manufacturers from foreign competition**, making U.S. steel, aluminum, and energy companies prime beneficiaries. E.g 

* **U.S. Steel** X 25% steel tariffs will boost profits
* **Cleveland-Cliffs** CLF Increased demand for domestic steel
* **Nucor** NUE Largest U.S. steel producer, stronger pricing power
* **Anheuser-Busch** BUD Domestic production = insulated from trade costs
* **Prologis** PLD Companies stockpiling goods = warehouse demand surge
* **Lockheed Martin** LMT Defense spending likely to rise under Trump
* **Marathon Petroleum** MPC Energy independence push favors domestic refiners

Companies with **complex supply chains** and reliance on **overseas production** are getting squeezed by **higher input costs and potential retaliatory tariffs**.E.g

* **Apple** AAPL Major China exposure, supply chain at risk
* **Tesla** TSLA Higher costs across supply chain, could hurt margins
* **General Motors** GM Tariffs on parts increase manufacturing costs
* **Ford** F Supply chain disruptions could impact production
* **Nike** NKE Manufacturing in China = higher import costs
* **Amazon** AMZN Increased cost of goods from global suppliers
* **Boeing** BA Risk of Chinese retaliation cutting aircraft orders 

Are you positioning for a **domestic manufacturing boom**, or do you think **this trade war will spiral into a full-blown recession**? Should we be **buying the dip** in industrials or **shorting overexposed multinationals**?

  
Trump’s strategy is clear: use **tariffs as a multipurpose weapon**, not just for trade but also for **immigration and national security**. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted that **Canada &amp; Mexico could avoid tariffs if they “improve border security” and crack down on fentanyl trafficking**. This suggests Trump is **negotiating in multiple arenas at once**, using economic pressure to force compliance on broader policy goals.

The problem? **Markets hate uncertainty**, and businesses can’t plan if policy keeps shifting based on unrelated factors. While some U.S. industries benefit, long-term uncertainty could hurt investment, expansion, and consumer confidence.",0,0,notllmchatbot,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jfidz3/a_deeper_dive_on_trumps_tariffs_and_market/,1jfidz3

selling data immeditely cut half both asian market and eu market. is it true?  have you do the reseach of it just a little bit deeply?

Actually it's bullshit. Take a look at the real data:

No.1 -- There are 250k locked down orders of New model Y since from Jan up to this week in China market only. Means the selling data come down of Feb just because everybody transfer order to New Model Y. and Y just start to delivery from early of Mar.   We can easily to understand the selling date will truning to stable at Mar and very high possible to hit a new record of history at April.

No.2 -- FSD - Very soon. Guys.. FSD will start to selling in China very soon . Maybe just no later than Jun.

No.3 -- the benifit of China - How many people know the price of model y in china actually? Let me clearify it. In 2024 - Model Y  's price is Usd32800 +/- , and the new Y price is Usd37500 +/-, Selling better, benifit is more higher per unit.

No. 4 - The competitors -  BYD, you can avoid this car maker when you are talking about BYD. but do you know they are only rule the low price market. the average price of BYD is Usd20000 +/-, BYD is not the competitor of tsla.   30k-40k unit /month is the tsla model y unbreakble selling qty.

after all of above, it's not working bad, right? so why the stock price is so week?

2025-03-19 22:45:22,r/TSLA,My Perspective on Next Few Months of $TSLA,"Official Report: Tesla Market Analysis
Authored by: TSLAGANG
Date: March 19, 2025

Executive Summary:
This report examines the current factors influencing Tesla's stock performance and market position as of March 19, 2025. The analysis identifies key elements contributing to weaker-than-expected Q4 sales and provides insights into broader market dynamics affecting the company.

Sales Performance Analysis:
Tesla's Q4 sales have been impacted by two primary internal factors:

1. Model Y Production Retooling:
   - The retooling of Model Y production lines to accommodate the upcoming Juniper update has led to a cannibalization effect.
   - This transition has temporarily reduced production capacity and sales of the current Model Y.

2. Osborne Effect:
   - Consumer awareness of the imminent Juniper release has triggered an Osborne effect.
   - Potential buyers are delaying purchases of the current Model Y, anticipating the new version's arrival.
   - This has resulted in lower sales figures, which some analysts have misattributed to unrelated causes.

Macroeconomic Context:
Several external factors are also influencing Tesla's performance within the broader market:

1. Geopolitical Situation:
   - The ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict has contributed to a general market downturn.
   - An anticipated ceasefire in the near future could stabilize markets and provide relief.

2. Monetary Policy Outlook:
   - Potential interest rate reductions are under consideration, which could stimulate consumer spending and benefit Tesla's sales.

3. Trade Policy Uncertainty:
   - Current economic unease surrounds the tariff situation.
   - Resolution of these tariff concerns is expected in the long term, potentially alleviating pressure on Tesla and the broader market.

Investment Perspective:
Despite the current headwinds, the confluence of these factors presents a strategic opportunity:
- The stock price is experiencing significant downward pressure, reaching relatively low levels.
- This situation suggests an opportune moment to establish or strengthen a long position in Tesla stock, rather than selling or pursuing a short strategy.

Conclusion:
Tesla's current sales challenges stem from a combination of internal production transitions and external market conditions. The retooling for the Model Y Juniper and the associated Osborne effect are temporary setbacks, while macroeconomic factors such as the Ukraine-Russia conflict and tariff uncertainties are expected to resolve favorably over time. With potential interest rate relief on the horizon, the present stock price dip may represent a compelling entry point for investors.

[**INTC (Intel)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&amp;p=d)\- TSMC board member Paul Liu has dismissed rumors regarding TSMC's potential acquisition of INTC's foundries, stating that such discussions have never occurred within the company. Overall caused a small selloff in INTC but nothing major- recently the more major catalyst was the new CEO Lip-Bu Tan. The market mainly considered this a rumor so interesting to see it still cause a small move. Overall not too interested unless we sell off more. TSM's clear denial of interest in acquiring INTC's foundries shows that they're not really interested in bringing more production to the US or really partnering with a US solution. Overall more of a interesting geopolitical note.

TSMC news came from Digitimes (a daily industry newspaper from Taiwan on the semicondcutor industry)

[**TUR (Turkey ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TUR&amp;p=d)\- The arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, a prominent rival to President Erdoğan has led to a significant selloff in the Turkish lira and Turkish assets. We've fallen close to 10% overnight in TUR, the Turkey ETF. Overall this likely won't see recovery for a few months. Last coup I remember was back in 2016 and it took a few months for TUR to recover (and it didn't do so linearly) so ultimately not interested in this. Continued political unrest and potential sanctions could further devalue Turkish assets, but I doubt there will be any outside intervention. EEM (the emerging markets ETF) seems to be unaffected overall.

2025-03-19 11:00:16,r/stocks,Tesla gets first in a series of permits it needs to run robotaxis in California,"SAN FRANCISCO, March 18 (Reuters) - Tesla [(TSLA.O),](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TSLA.O) on Tuesday received the first in a series of approvals from California required for the electric car maker to eventually launch a promised robotaxi service in the state, according to a state regulator.The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) said it approved Tesla's application for a [transportation charter-party carrier permit](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-seeking-approval-offer-ride-hailing-services-california-bloomberg-news-2025-02-27/) (TCP), a license typically associated with chauffeur-operated services, allowing the company to own and control a fleet of vehicles and transport employees on pre-arranged trips.

The permit is a prerequisite for applying to operate an autonomous ride-hailing service in California, but a CPUC spokesperson said the current permit ""does not authorize them to provide rides"" in autonomous vehicles, and does not allow Tesla to operate a ride-hailing service to the public.With sales growth slowing, Tesla CEO [Elon Musk](https://www.reuters.com/business/elon-musk/) pivoted his focus last year to rolling out robotaxis and has promised driverless ride-hailing services to the public in California and Texas this year. In October, Tesla revealed the [Cybercab](https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-musk-unveil-robotaxis-amid-fanfare-skepticism-2024-10-10/), a robotaxi concept that had no steering wheel or control pedals.Tesla had applied for the TCP permit in November 2024, the regulator said in an email, adding that the company had not applied for the other permits yet.Tesla would also need permits from the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and CPUC in order to operate a fully autonomous robotaxi service that charges customers.Tesla currently only has a DMV permit to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver.A DMV spokesperson said on Tuesday that Tesla has not applied for any additional permits from the agency, which would be required to move forward with a CPUC application for driverless taxis.Tesla did not respond to requests for comments on the permit and details on the other applications.

2025-03-19 06:55:08,r/stocks,Trump’s Trade War 2.0: The Stocks I’m Watching,"With Trump back in office and tariffs returning in full force, I’ve been analyzing what this means for U.S. equities. His latest moves—25% steel and aluminum tariffs, expanded levies on Chinese imports, and a tariff-heavy negotiation strategy—echo his first term but with even **stronger measures**.



While 2018-2020 gave us some clues, the market setup in 2025 is **different**:

• **Higher inflation &amp; rates:** Tariffs add inflationary pressure, making the Fed’s job harder.

• **China’s response will change:** Unlike in 2018, China now **dominates EV battery production** and **controls rare earth supply chains**—this could hurt U.S. tech more than before.

• **Supply chain resilience is mixed:** Companies have talked about reshoring for years, but it’s still expensive and slow.

Given these factors, here’s how I’m positioning:

**Likely Winners:**

1. **Steel &amp; Aluminum (NUE, STLD, CLF)** – Tariffs give them pricing power, though cost inflation is a risk.

2. **Defense &amp; Cybersecurity (LMT, PLTR, CRWD)** – “America First” likely means **higher defense budgets**.

3. **Regional Banks (JPM, BAC, GS)** – If deregulation follows, these should gain.

4. **Domestic Infrastructure (CAT, DE, OSK)** – If tariffs hurt foreign suppliers, U.S. construction demand rises.



**Likely Losers:**

1. **Tech Giants (AAPL, NVDA, QCOM, INTC)** – Heavy China exposure = supply chain and revenue risks.

2. **Consumer Goods (NKE, WMT, DG)** – Imports get pricier, and passing costs to lower-income customers is tough.

3. **Auto &amp; Industrial (TSLA, GM, F, MMM)** – Higher input costs + China retaliation = pain.

4. **Agri Exporters (ADM, TSN, BG)** – If China targets U.S. farm products again, these get hit.



**What I’m watching:**

📌 Will China retaliate with rare earth metal export bans? (Impacts TSLA, NVDA, QCOM)

📌 Do inflation expectations rise, pushing Fed policy hawkish? (Bad for rate-sensitive stocks)

📌 Does Trump backtrack on any tariffs? (A la 2019)

📌 Will domestic manufacturing gains **outweigh** supply chain disruptions?

I’d love to hear counterpoints. Which stocks do you think will **outperform or underperform** in Trump’s Trade War 2.0?",486,233,notllmchatbot,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jeqaup/trumps_trade_war_20_the_stocks_im_watching/,1jeqaup

2025-03-15 20:35:24,r/stocks,Tesla stock declines could cost Elon Musk something important,"Snippet from this article:”After a slight rebound earlier this week, Tesla's TSLA stock is back to falling, keeping with its recent performance. Even U.S. President Donald Trump's purchase of one hasn’t done much to spark real momentum for the electric vehicle (EV) leader.
After enjoying significant growth throughout the final months of 2024 and through early 2025, TSLA has lost its previous momentum and isn’t showing signs of a rebound. As reports of declining sales and shifting consumer sentiment continue to trend, it's hard to ignore the company’s questionable outlook.

Link: https://www.thestreet.com/technology/tesla-stock-declines-could-cost-elon-musk-something-important

Many of these problems can be traced to CEO Elon Musk, who is preoccupied with his new responsibilities at the Department of Government Efficiency. His absence at Tesla’s manufacturing facilities is being felt as share prices continue to trend downward.
Musk has lost a lot of money as TSLA stock falls, but he could end up losing something else.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk may be in for a difficult decision if TSLA stock keeps declining. 

Musk’s intertwined business empire could be in trouble 
Tesla may be the company for which Musk is best known, but his assets include several other prominent tech names, including SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter). This wide array of responsibilities concerned investors long before he accepted his new position at DOGE.
Now that he has this new position, Musk is spending even less time running his companies, and things haven’t been going well for any of them. While Tesla stock fell last week, a SpaceX rocket exploded during a test flight, and a cyberattack took X down, although users regained access fairly quickly.

Tesla Bull sounds the alarm on Elon Musk’s leadership

This week, reports surfaced that TSLA stock’s poor performance has resulted in significant losses for Musk. On Monday, March 10, he lost roughly $4.7 billion for every $10 the stock price declined, amounting to a total loss of $18.8 billion.

When TSLA dumped 40 dollars on Monday it looked like the trend line is invalid, but I mentioned it can wick back above the trend line like it has shown it does in the past.

The weekly candle closed near (still bellow) the MOAT.

TSLA needs to gap up above the trend line (~255) on Monday, just like it gapped down bellow the trend line last Monday, and I think it will.

Bullish confirmations I found are in the comments.

I’ll stop being bullish temporarily if it doesn’t gap up on Monday, but I’m not going to flip bearish immediately.

Products that never come or are not up to the specs that are promised. The company now defrauds the Canadian government to cash in on EV subsedies.

Still, the valuation of the company is 6 to 7 higher than of motor companies that sell a multiple of vehicles and legit robot producers like Boston Dynamics combined.

From Lithium’s Slump to Antimony’s Rise, the Critical Elements Driving Tesla—and Your Next Big Trade

Tesla’s electric vehicles—from the sleek Model 3 to the rugged Cybertruck—aren’t just rewriting the rules of the road; they’re reshaping the global mineral market. Beneath the hood lies a powerhouse of critical minerals, the unsung heroes driving Tesla’s dominance and electrifying the portfolios of savvy investors. These elements aren’t mere commodities—they’re the gears of a multi-trillion-dollar EV revolution. Let’s unpack the minerals that make Tesla tick, why they’re indispensable, and what’s brewing in the market as of March 2025.

**The Mineral All-Stars Powering Tesla**

1. **Lithium: The Battery Bedrock**Lithium is the cornerstone of Tesla’s lithium-ion batteries, packing 10-15 kg into each pack to deliver jaw-dropping ranges—like the Model S Plaid’s 390 miles. It stores energy like a champ, but the market’s a mess. Prices have cratered over 80% since late 2022, sitting at $10,400 per ton in 2025, per S&amp;P Global, thanks to a flood of supply from Australia and China. Tesla’s secured lithium from Nevada’s clay deposits, but with EV demand still climbing, this slump could be a blip before a 2030 crunch.
2. **Nickel: The Powerhouse Player**Nickel, at 29-56 kg per Tesla battery, is the muscle behind energy density, letting drivers squeeze more miles per charge. Elon Musk’s called it “the biggest bottleneck” for EV scaling, with Tesla’s high-nickel NCA (nickel-cobalt-aluminum) cathodes leading the charge. The catch? Supply’s shaky—Indonesia dominates, and prices are jittery after a 20% drop in 2024. Tesla’s 20-million-car-by-2030 goal needs over 1 million tonnes annually—half the world’s output. Miners are scrambling.
3. **Cobalt: The Stability Sentinel**Cobalt (7-15 kg) keeps Tesla’s batteries from going boom, stabilizing the cathode. But it’s a headache—60% comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where ethical mining scandals abound. Tesla’s slashing cobalt use, eyeing cobalt-free LFP (lithium-iron-phosphate) batteries for cheaper models. Prices are down 30% since 2022, but it’s still a must-have for now, making supply chain bets a rollercoaster.
4. **Graphite: The Anode Anchor**Graphite, a hefty 52 kg per battery, is the anode’s MVP, storing lithium ions and keeping energy flowing. It’s dull but vital—no substitute exists. China controls 85% of the market, and with EV demand set to triple graphite needs by 2035, per the IEA, any hiccup could spike prices. Tesla’s locked in synthetic graphite deals, but natural supply’s a looming choke point.
5. **Copper: The Conductive Catalyst**Copper (85-200 kg) is Tesla’s wiring wizard, threading through motors, batteries, and chargers—two to three times more than a gas car. It’s the backbone of efficiency, and as charging networks explode, demand’s on track to double by 2030. Prices are creeping up—$9,500 per ton in 2025—buoyed by grid upgrades and EV hype. Tesla’s sniffing around copper mines, but global shortages loom.
6. **Antimony: The Stealth Strengthener**Antimony (100-200 grams) is a sleeper hit, fortifying the 12-volt lead-acid battery (yes, Teslas still use one for accessories) and solder in electronics. At 1-2% of the lead battery’s weight, plus a pinch in circuit boards, it boosts durability and conductivity. It’s a niche mineral, but China’s 55% supply grip and rising tech demand could tighten the screws—prices hit $13,000 per ton in 2024, up 20%.
7. **Rare Earths: The Magnetic Dynamos**Neodymium and praseodymium (a few kg) power Tesla’s permanent magnet motors, delivering torque in 75% of its lineup. These rare earths are efficiency kings, but China’s 90% stranglehold makes them a geopolitical flashpoint. Prices spiked 15% in 2024 amid trade tensions, and Tesla’s testing rare-earth-free ferrite motors. For now, they’re non-negotiable—and a stock wildcard.

**Why These Minerals Are Make-or-Break**

Tesla’s not just building cars; it’s forging a mineral-dependent empire. The goal? 20 million vehicles annually by 2030. That’s a mineral haul dwarfing today’s supply—1 million tonnes of nickel, 200,000 tonnes of lithium, and mountains of copper. Lithium’s drowning in surplus now (33,000 tons in 2025 vs. 84,000 in 2024), but the IEA warns of deficits by decade’s end as EV sales soar. Copper’s stretched thin, graphite’s a China risk, and antimony’s a dark horse. Tesla’s inking deals—lithium in Nevada, nickel whispers in Canada—but mining’s a slow grind, taking 10-17 years per project. Add geopolitical curveballs (China, Congo), and you’ve got a high-stakes game.

These minerals don’t just power Tesla—they fuel a global shift. EVs need six times more minerals than gas cars, per the IEA, tying Tesla’s fate to commodities like never before. Supply hiccups could stall production, while surpluses (hello, lithium) tank miner profits. It’s a tightrope walk with trillion-dollar implications.

**The Market Buzz: Risks and Rewards**

Lithium’s bloodbath—down 22% in 2024—has miners like Albemarle reeling, yet shrinking surpluses signal a rebound. Nickel’s volatile, with Indonesia’s flood keeping prices soft at $16,000 per ton, but Tesla’s demand could flip the script. Copper’s simmering, up 10% in 2025, as electrification heats up. Antimony’s a quiet climber, rare earths are tense, and cobalt’s a fading star. Graphite’s steady but vulnerable.

Investors, take note: Tesla’s vertical moves—lithium clay tech, supply contracts—could shield its $800 billion valuation from chaos. But miners face a gauntlet—new projects lag, environmental pushback’s fierce, and ESG rules tighten. BHP’s copper-nickel play, Lynas’s rare earths, and small-cap antimony bets are in the crosshairs. Shortages could ignite rallies; oversupply could crush them. The IEA pegs a 40-fold mineral demand spike by 2040—this isn’t a trend, it’s a tsunami.

**The Takeaway: Tesla’s Mineral Gambit**

Tesla’s EVs are a mineral marvel—lithium’s cheap but poised, nickel’s stretched, antimony’s sneaky, and copper’s king. These elements aren’t just tech; they’re the pulse of a market teetering on scarcity and surplus. For investors, it’s a high-voltage play: Tesla’s driving demand, but supply’s the wild card. Watch the miners, track the geopolitics, and brace for impact—this EV revolution’s electric, chaotic, and loaded with upside.",3,1,RizzCapital,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1jb7w9a/teslas_mineral_muscle_the_raw_power_behind_the_ev/,1jb7w9a

2025-03-12 10:57:47,r/TSLA,Musk launches appeal to restore $56 billion Tesla payday,"WILMINGTON, Delaware, March 11 (Reuters) - Elon Musk kicked off his appeal to try to restore his $56 billion payday from Tesla on Tuesday, claiming a lower court judge made multiple legal errors in rescinding the record compensation.
The 2018 pay package resulted in spectacular growth for the electric vehicle maker and yet it was determined by the lower Court of Chancery to be unfair to shareholders, who voted twice to approve the plan, Musk argued.

""That counterintuitive result defies settled principles of Delaware law, sound corporate governance, and common sense,"" said the opening appeal brief by Musk and the current and former Tesla directors who are defendants in the case.
In January 2024, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick rescinded the pay package of stock options, calling it ""unfathomable."" She said it was unfair to Tesla shareholders because the directors who approved it were beholden to Musk and Tesla withheld key information from investors before they voted to approve it.

In June, Tesla got shareholder approval for the pay package for a second time, but the judge rejected that as grounds for reversing her ruling.
The pay package had awarded Musk options to buy around 303 million Tesla shares at around $23 each if the company hit performance and valuation goals. Tesla stock closed Tuesday at $230.58.
Tesla has said creating a new pay package of similar value could result in a charge of $25 billion, making the appeal an important avenue for restoring Musk's compensation and keeping his attention on Tesla.

Musk has said that he wants a greater stake in Tesla or he might develop products outside of the company. The appeal comes as he is dedicating time to President Donald Trump's government efficiency effort, known as DOGE, which has sparked demonstrations outside Tesla dealerships. The stock has fallen sharply in recent weeks.
In the appeal brief, Musk and the other defendants said McCormick wrongly applied a very difficult legal standard known as entire fairness to assess the pay package.

She arrived at that standard by finding Musk, who owned 21.9% of the stock at the time the board approved the pay package, controlled the pay negotiations, according to the brief. In addition, she wrongly determined that ordinary business relationships among directors made them conflicted and she erroneously faulted Tesla's disclosures ahead of the 2018 shareholder vote, according to the brief.

Applying the entire fairness standard amounted to granting a ""license to sue"" to Tesla shareholders, the brief said. The lawsuit was brought by Richard Tornetta, a Tesla investor who owned nine shares when he filed the case in 2018. The lawsuit benefits Tesla, not Tornetta, in what is known as a derivative suit.

Musk blasted the pay decision and has encouraged other companies to follow Tesla and SpaceX and reincorporate out of Delaware. A handful have left the state or said they might, including Meta Platforms, opens new tab(META.O), opens new tab, TripAdvisor (TRIP.O), opens new tab and Trump's media company.

Fears that a trickle of companies will turn into a stampede, which has been dubbed ""DExit,"" prompted the state's legislature to consider amending its corporate law to better protect controlling shareholders from lawsuits.",913,91,TrumpIsWeird,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1j9gimo/musk_launches_appeal_to_restore_56_billion_tesla/,1j9gimo

2025-03-11 17:23:58,r/TSLA,Trump just advertised buying a Tesla,"If you had told me even just 1 year ago if I thought it were possible for Trump to advertise buying a Tesla, or literally any EV, I would've said you were crazy. But here we are.

Today Trump apparently posted on truth social saying that in order to stand with Elon against unjust attacks he would be buying a Tesla. I don't think people realize how massive this is.

Tesla's mission is to transition the world to renewable energy. Well, how do you do that if half the country stubbornly mostly does not want to even consider buying an EV? That, I think, is likely much less of a problem now than it was yesterday.

This isn't just bullish for Tesla, this is a huge win for environmentalism. We need conservatives to buy EVs, we can't just pretend that half the country doesn't exist when trying to solve this problem after all, and I stand by the fact that Elon really has been the only one seriously trying to market EVs to conservatives. And now all that effort has paid off.

I think every argument about Trump being bad for EVs and environmentalism is now turned on its head. If Trump is telling people ""I bought a tesla because it was the right thing to do"" then even though he supports increasing fossil fuel production he is helping popularize Tesla and in the longer term that means significantly more profits for Tesla, which means more grid battery production, which means grid-scale renewable energy becomes much more cost competitive with gas. And we all know that once solar panels and batteries get cheap enough they could easily replace coal and gas as our primary source of electricity in this country. Too many advantages to ignore (virtual powerplants, gridless homes, stable electricity networks, easily scalable power plants, low risk working environments, etc.).

Sure the economy is shitting the bed right now but once Trump is done with his trade war it will eventually return to normal. And at THAT time, that is when we will see the main benefits of what has just happened. The future is very bright!!!

We had a hell of a selloff yesterday. I see today as an attempt to recover, not too interested in going short on the market today unless we break new lows. Trying out a new layout today.

Saw these move mainly due to recession fears and the entire market panicking, MASSIVE move yesterday.

Yesterday, mainly traded TSLA on the overnight exchanges. It had the largest move and got down to around $212. Overall a lot of negative sentiment ranging from boycotts and Elon controversies. Not too interested in trading TSLA today again.  I'm interested in NVDA if we break below 100 but again I think that we'll mainly see a small bounce today rather than breaking new lows. As for RDDT, we're 50% down from highs! Interesting swing candidate but will see how today goes. To me these are the standout stocks yesterday to trade due to recession fears. I don't really see a way out for TSLA regarding the boycotts. We've also seen a decently large move in the VIX (VXX) and we're close to above 60- I'm interested in shorting if we're above $60 but doubt we'll hit that today.

[**ASAN (Asana)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASAN&amp;p=d)

CEO/co-founder, Dustin Moskovitz announced retirement. The company reported Q4 revenues of $188.3M, a 10% YoY increase, and issued a revenue outlook for fiscal 2026 below expectations (resulting in the drop).

That drop was close to 25%, mainly because Dustin owns close to 54% of the company, which signals a LOT of uncertainty and lack of faith in the company. Overall outlook is decently disappointing, and I'm mainly interested in it if we break $11.50 and very interested in buying $10.

**Ticker:** [**AAL (American Airlines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAL&amp;p=d)

AAL projected a higher-than-expected Q1 loss and revised its revenue outlook downward, attributing the weaker forecast to softness in the domestic leisure segment. This is probably amplified by fears of flying, mainly due to people being terrified of all the plane accidents that have happened in 2025. Recession fears also lead to people cutting their vacations/discretionary spending and saving money, so things may get worse. Overall we're seeing a slight recovery in the premarket but still watching to see how this trades. To me airlines are one of the bigger leading signals of economic uncertainty so will continue watching.

2025-03-10 15:16:06,r/stocks,Why the 2025 Bear Market is the real deal &amp; only just getting started,"When it comes to recent major market corrections, the largest drops have coincided with the loosening of interest rates. There have been market corrections outside of these periods, however, those events are significantly lesser in scope compared to the current analog situations of 2000, 2008, and 2020. 

The Fed Funds rate was held at 6.5% from June 2000 to December 2000. It was 5.25 from July of 2006 to July of 2007. It was 2.4 between January of 2019 and July of 2019. 

As the Fed began cutting rates, in each situation, the market began to decline. However, it was during these declines that illiquidity events took place, causing major panic, and subsequent cratering of markets. 

The 1-point decline in interest rates from peak coincides with February 2001, December 2007, and November of 2019. Each respective recession officially began in March of 2001, December of 2007, and February 2020. 

We hit 1-point below peak in January. There is a strong possibility we are ALREADY in recession, however, genius economists will only tell us this in a year or two. 

In any case, each of these recessions coincided with feat contagion and general panic. Each of these events also bottomed after major catastrophes - in 2000 it was 9/11 and Enron, in 2008 it was Lehman + subprime crisis, in 2019 it was.... that horrible thing that we no longer talk about. 

We are already in the fear stage of the market. 2000's panic was a general meltdown PRIOR to the crises that later unfolded. However, it was those crises that marked its bottom. 2008 and 2020's craterings occurred simultaneous to their crises although stocks did drift down prior to 2008 as well. 

This begs the question: what is the crisis that may or may not occur with the cyclical correction that happens as the Fed cuts rates EVERY cycle? Will it be a true black swan no-one saw coming (9/11) or will it be something like Enron, Lehman, or COVID, where some DID see what was coming ahead of the general panic?

Could TSLA be the Enron of the 2025 bust? It is seeming more and more plausible with each passing day. In any case, the bottom of the market in each of the aforementioned cases occurred simultaneous to the Fed funds rate hitting 0 (or almost 0 in 2003). I expect shelter contribution to CPI to vanish in the next few reports + unemployment to rise significantly, this could give the Fed leeway to put rates back to 0 as soon as Q3-Q4 2025. In both 2009 and 2020 the Fed rate hit 0 when annualized CPI did the same (in March), and March of both years also coincided with their respective market bottoms. 

TLDR; we are far from the bottom, which should occur when Fed Funds hit 0, buy when that happens but before that point, gird your loins.",1438,460,developmentfiend,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j7zm8c/why_the_2025_bear_market_is_the_real_deal_only/,1j7zm8c

2025-03-10 00:35:58,r/stocks,TSLA being investigated by Transport Canada for cooking their books in Canada to snag EV rebates without selling cars.,"The article notes that **four Tesla dealerships claimed to have sold 8,653 Teslas in 3 days.** Assuming each dealership opens from 9AM-5PM, that's **90 cars sold per hour per dealership**. Worth noting that Canada's EV rebate program was set to shut down, interesting how Tesla found 8,600 sales in 3 days before it did...

Ironic that Musk, who has recently repeatedly said that people who rely on government payments are leeches and that Canada is not a real country, is now accused of trying to leech off of Canadian taxpayer-funded EV rebates himself to the tune of $43M.

I guess that's one way to maintain revenue while sales drop 90%!

Note: investigation is ongoing and there has been no confirmation of official wrongdoing yet.

Edit: Since this post got more attention then I expected. Yes I posted this Sunday and TSLA is currently down 13% today. However I do not think this is causing the drop, and rather it’s an overall market pull back from trade wars and from Europe sales declines.

We just bounced off the Mother of all Trendlines, that started at the beginning of the long term (hopefully forever) uptrend on April 24, 2024 (big gap up after bad earnings report on April 23rd🤔). TSLA was on a long term downtrend before that date.

It also made a hammer candle on the daily and 4hr timeframe yesterday, a sign of a reversal.

This chart is 7am to 4pm market hours, which I found to be very accurate for trend lines.

I’m predicting a complete reversal. We might retest the MOAT or wick under it if Q2 deliveries come bad, but I’m not expecting the number to be as bad as most people think. 

Robotaxi in California and Texas soon, and unsupervised FSD in all Teslas should be released a few months after that in America and Canada. Imagine sending your car driverless to pick up a friend or a girl up, what a flex. Anyone selling now will regret it in 3-6 months IMO.
￼​

Edit:

This is a weekly timeframe trend line.

There’s been bad times when it wicks under the trendline (before shareholder meeting June 2024, Japan Yen trade August 2024, before Q3 2024 earnings when everyone was super bearish), but the weekly candle always closes above the trendline. This is one of those bad times for the whole market, and I’m hoping it’s transient like those other events. If the weekly candle closes above the trendline at ~254, then the uptrend is intact. If not, I’ll cut some losses and switch to sells until the weekly candle closes above the trend line.

2025-03-07 06:13:21,r/TSLA,Potential Scenarios and Implications for Tesla Call Options,"Several potential scenarios could emerge from today's events, each with different implications for Tesla and corresponding call options:

The most favorable scenario for Tesla call holders would involve a moderately positive jobs report that supports economic growth without triggering inflation concerns, coupled with dovish commentary from Powell suggesting continued rate cut potential, and reassuring statements from Trump indicating flexibility on tariff implementation. This combination could reinvigorate risk appetite and potentially reverse Tesla's recent negative momentum.

A more challenging scenario would involve significantly stronger-than-expected employment data prompting concerns about delayed rate cuts, hawkish messaging from Powell emphasizing inflation vigilance, and doubling down on protectionist trade policies by Trump. This combination could exacerbate selling pressure across growth stocks, with Tesla potentially facing additional headwinds due to its international exposure.

Tesla's immediate trading direction will likely be established by the jobs report before market open, with Powell and Trump's speeches potentially reinforcing or reversing this initial trajectory.

2025-03-06 16:40:30,r/TSLA,What would you have to believe to justify the price of TSLA today @$265 per share?,"Just for fun let's think about what you'd have to believe to value the company at it's current price on a cash flow basis

  
1) You'd have to assume that they will take massive share of the auto market while maintaining above industry average profitability

The collective net income of all the major US auto makers over the past decade is \~$235B or $23.5B per year. So just for fun let's say that Tesla takes 50% of that over the next decade. that would imply 11.75B in annual net income, for a P/E ratio of 70

2) You'd have to assume that autonomous cars either made the market massively more profitable or way larger. 

Let's just assume for a second that autonomy doubled the net income of the industry over the next decade, That would bring the P/E ratio down to 35

3) Since we're not there yet you'd have other assume that Tesla creates an AI enabled robotics market that's the same size or larger than the current auto industry and is the massive winner in that market, AND the market structure is such that Tesla can maintain a nice margin.

Let's just say for fun that they create that market and they maintain 50% of it and it looks like the auto industry, so we add another $11.75B in net profit on top of that. That gets us to $35.25B in annual net income and P/E ratio of 23.5. Still pricey based on historical norms but not outrageous. 

Here's the kicker. They'd either need to do that TOMORROW, or they'd have to blow those numbers out of the water, because if it took Tesla  a decade to achieve all of the above outcomes then even if you use a low WACC you're still way over valued even with all that phenomenal success.",3,1,IkeaDefender,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1j4y9tf/what_would_you_have_to_believe_to_justify_the/,1j4y9tf

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

Today is mostly related to Trump's speech yesterday. Secretary Lutnick announced yesterday ""Tariffs compromise announcement will likely come tomorrow"", so will be on the lookout for that.

News: [Trump Hails Tariffs as US Economy Barrels Into Trade Wars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-05/trump-to-tout-tariffs-unveil-energy-mineral-projects-in-speech)

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)**,** [**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&amp;p=d)**,** [**SMH (Semiconductor ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMH&amp;p=d)**,** [**SOXL (3x Semiconductor ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SOXL&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Trump has called for an end to the CHIPS Act Subsidy Program (instead preferring tariffs).

**Technicals:** Short biased. Obviously this takes away a lot of investment in semis companies. Extremely negative catalyst but unlikely it will get repealed due to how much bipartisan support it had.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The CHIPS and Science Act gave $280B in new funding to boost domestic research/manufacturing of semis in the US, and also aimed to strengthen supply chain resilience against China and widely considered to be a success because it spurred the development/dominance in the semis sector in America.

**Risks:** If this gets repealed, we're likely going to see a pretty large pullback in the semis. Obviously this is dependent on what the tariffs Trump touts will do as well. [I wrote a little more about my take on a different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j437g9/trump_calls_for_end_to_52_billion_chips_act/) but overall more of the same (I think it's a terrible idea).

**Catalyst:** The Trump administration is considering granting relief from the recently imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports for products that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

**Technicals:** We've seen all three stocks (GM especially) make gains due to this announcement, will watch at open for volume.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The automotive industry in US/Canada/Mexico involves the most economic/manufacturing cooperation in the USMCA, they're the most obvious beneficiaries of this potential catalyst.

**Risks:** If they don't actually give relief, then will likely pullback- cars are one of the most affected products of tariffs and pretty much every car company has spoken about tariffs on their earnings calls.

**Catalyst:** Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has indicated that Trump plans to grant the main biggest CC a ""unique status"" within the Bitcoin reserve strategy, which will be unveiled at the White House Crypto Summit on Friday.

**Technicals:** We've seen the underlying spike close to 8-9% since yesterday, watching $90K level. Interested to see how we go prior to the actual summit.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Obviously an extremely bullish catalyst, we've bounced strongly off the $80K level recently. I usually trade through the ETFs as needed, and HOOD/Coinbase serve as proxies in case the ETFs aren't liquid or have already moved.

**Risks:** Worth waiting for the catalyst and watching the CC Summit on Friday. I personally see this more of a ""buy on hype"" kind of catalyst, unless there's an announcement of something extremely bullish I'm not sure how much more this will move the needle.

**Ticker:** [**HII (Huntington Ingalls Industries)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HII&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Trump has announced initiatives aimed at strengthening the U.S. shipbuilding industry to counter China's dominance, spoke about the creation of a White House Office of Shipbuilding and the introduction of special tax incentives.

**Technicals:** None that I'm particularly interested in, this is a longer-term play.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China produces over half of the world's merchant vessels, this is more of a play to reduce reliance on foreign-shipping.

**Risks:** There's a chance that this will never happen, Trump tried to create a ""Cybersecurity Department"" in his first term but that was never formally created and we kept those duties spread out between the FBI/DHS/NSA. But we also have the Space Force so... stay tuned.

On the monthly chart, the red and green indicators suggest there’s still room for further adjustment. Plus, its market cap is quite large, currently around **$880 billion**, while **Apple** and **NVIDIA** are at **$3.5 trillion** and **$2.8 trillion**, respectively.

The potential catalysts ahead include **robots, full self-driving (FSD) reaching full deployment, and autonomous taxis becoming a reality**. However, **Grok AI isn’t actually part of Tesla’s business**, so it can’t be factored in as a growth driver. That means the upside potential is rather limited.

  
Those are the other ones I can think of, but none of them are super favorable.

**Potential Catalysts for Tesla’s Future Growth 🚀**

**1. Full Self-Driving (FSD) Deployment 🚗💨**

• If FSD reaches full maturity and gets regulatory approval, Tesla’s subscription revenue could skyrocket.

• Tesla’s AI and data advantage keeps it ahead in the self-driving race.

**2. Robotaxi (Autonomous Taxi Service) 🚖🤖**

• Expected to launch in the coming years, dramatically reducing travel costs and unlocking a major new revenue stream.

• This could transform Tesla from a car-selling company into a “pay-per-mile” mobility service.

**3. Robotics Business (Tesla Optimus) 🤖🏭**

• The Optimus humanoid robot is already being tested in Tesla factories, improving efficiency.

• If scaled globally, it could disrupt manufacturing and service industries in a big way.

**4. 4680 Battery Breakthrough &amp; Cost Reduction 🔋⚡**

• Mass production of 4680 batteries is progressing, leading to lower costs and longer range.

• Cheaper batteries will enable Tesla to introduce more affordable models, expanding its market share.

**5. Energy Business (Storage &amp; Solar) 🌞🔋**

• Megapack (large-scale energy storage) is seeing rapid growth with strong demand.

• Solar energy could become an additional revenue stream.

**6. Global Market Expansion &amp; New Models 🌍🚙**

• Tesla is expected to release a **cheaper Model 2** by **2025-2026**, targeting a \~$25,000 price point—potentially driving massive sales growth.

• Emerging markets like India and Southeast Asia present major new opportunities.

**7. Dojo Supercomputer &amp; AI Development 🖥️🤖**

• Tesla’s in-house Dojo supercomputer enhances FSD training and could become a new **Tesla Cloud AI** business.

• AI + self-driving advancements will significantly improve Tesla’s data processing capabilities.

**8. Supercharger Network Business ⚡🔌**

• Tesla is gradually opening its charging network to other automakers (Ford, GM, etc.), generating additional revenue.

🔥 **Bottom Line:**

If Tesla successfully scales **FSD, Robotaxi, and Optimus**, its business model could evolve from selling cars into a **self-driving + robotics + energy + AI powerhouse**, unlocking a whole new growth trajectory! 🚀",4,1,Trust_Just,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1j4228f/please_tell_me_out_loud_what_else_is_good_behind/,1j4228f
2025-03-05 13:07:15,r/TSLA,Grok’s opinion,"Put 2 prompts into grok
1. Is investing in tesla a good idea right now it looks cheap compared to previous prices but online i read a lot of negative sentiment.

2. In the s&amp;p500 what stock today is the best deal, having good earnings outlook and not at a high valuation.

Answer 1.

Deciding whether to invest in Tesla (TSLA) right now involves weighing its current price against its historical highs, the negative sentiment you’ve noticed online, and the broader context of its fundamentals and future potential. Let’s break this down.

Tesla’s stock price has indeed dropped from its peak. In late 2024, it hit a record high above $480, but as of early March 2025, it’s trading closer to $272 (based on recent web data). Compared to that peak, it’s down over 40%, which might make it seem ""cheap"" relative to where it was. Historically, Tesla has experienced sharp swings—its 52-week range spans from about $152 to $488—so the current price sits in the middle, not at a clear bargain-basement level but certainly below its highs.

The negative sentiment you’re seeing online isn’t baseless. Recent reports highlight challenges: Tesla’s EV sales in 2024 declined by 1% year-over-year, the first drop since 2011, amid rising competition from companies like BYD and softening global demand for electric vehicles. Sales in key markets like China (down 49% in February 2025) and Scandinavia (down over 40%) have tanked, partly due to pricing pressures and consumer backlash tied to Elon Musk’s political activities. Analysts have cut price targets—Bank of America recently slashed theirs from $490 to $380—citing tariff risks and weaker fundamentals. Some, like Guggenheim, even predict a potential 40% plunge within a year if growth doesn’t rebound. This bearish chatter reflects real concerns about near-term earnings, especially since EVs still drive 78% of Tesla’s revenue.

On the flip side, Tesla’s bulls argue the negativity is overblown. Morgan Stanley recently named it a ""Top Pick,"" predicting a rebound, while Wedbush’s Dan Ives sees a $550 target (a 100%+ upside) based on long-term catalysts like Full Self-Driving (FSD), robotics (Optimus), and new models like the Model Y Juniper. Tesla’s working on unsupervised FSD rollouts, Cybercab production by 2026, and a cheaper mass-market vehicle in mid-2025—moves that could reignite growth. Plus, its vertical integration and charging network give it an edge competitors struggle to match. Optimists like Cathie Wood project FSD alone could push Tesla’s revenue to $1.2 trillion by 2029, dwarfing its 2024 haul of $97.6 billion.

Valuation-wise, Tesla’s pricey. Even after the drop, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio hovers above 80, triple Nvidia’s and far above the Nasdaq 100’s average. A 50% further decline, as some bears suggest, would still leave it at a P/E of 40—hardly ""cheap"" unless earnings surge. Analysts’ consensus target is around $320, suggesting modest upside from $272, but the range is wild ($24.86 to $550), reflecting deep uncertainty.

Sentiment online—on forums like Reddit or X—leans mixed. Some investors see a buying opportunity, pointing to Tesla’s innovation pipeline; others warn of a sinking ship as Musk’s focus splits toward DOGE and political controversies alienate buyers. The average analyst rating is ""Hold,"" with 36 tracked: roughly a third say Buy, a third Hold, and a third Sell. That’s a stalemate, not a ringing endorsement.

So, is it a good idea? It depends on you. If you’re a long-term believer in Tesla’s tech vision and can stomach volatility, the current dip might look appealing—especially if you think FSD and robotics will pay off big. But if you’re rattled by the negative noise, weak 2025 sales trends, and a lofty valuation, waiting for clearer signs of a turnaround (or a deeper discount) might make sense. Either way, it’s not a slam-dunk ""cheap"" buy—more a high-stakes bet on an uncertain future. What’s your risk tolerance, and how long are you willing to hold? That’s the real decider here.

Answer 2. 

To identify the best deal in the S&amp;P 500 today—March 5, 2025—with a good earnings outlook and a low valuation, we need a stock that balances a reasonable price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, strong projected earnings growth, and a price not inflated by market hype. Based on current market conditions and available data, **General Motors (GM)** stands out as a compelling candidate.

As of early March 2025, GM trades around $52 per share, with a forward P/E ratio of approximately 5.8. This is strikingly low compared to the S&amp;P 500’s average forward P/E of 23.6, suggesting it’s undervalued relative to the broader market. The stock’s price-to-book (P/B) ratio is about 0.85, below 1.0, meaning it trades at a discount to its book value—another sign of a bargain. For context, tech-heavy S&amp;P 500 names like Nvidia (forward P/E ~40) or Tesla (forward P/E ~80) carry valuations orders of magnitude higher, reflecting growth premiums GM doesn’t demand.

Earnings outlook bolsters the case. Analysts expect GM’s earnings per share (EPS) to grow from $9.66 in 2024 to $10.03 in 2025, a solid if unspectacular 3.8% increase, with some forecasts reaching $10.50 (8.7% growth) depending on EV and truck sales. Revenue is projected to rise from $182.1 billion in 2024 to $185.6 billion in 2025, up 1.9%. This growth isn’t explosive, but it’s reliable, driven by strong demand for GM’s high-margin trucks (e.g., Silverado) and a recovering EV segment with models like the Equinox EV gaining traction. Q4 2024 results beat expectations—$3.06 EPS vs. $2.20 consensus—showing resilience despite a 2.2% sales dip, thanks to pricing power and cost cuts. GM’s guidance for 2025 targets $13.5-$15.5 billion in adjusted EBIT, up from $13.9 billion in 2024, signaling confidence.

Why isn’t it overvalued? GM lacks the speculative froth of AI or tech stocks. Its P/E has hovered below 10 for years, even as peers like Ford (forward P/E ~7) or Stellantis (~4) compete in the same space. Market sentiment has been lukewarm—down 8% in the past month amid tariff worries and a broader auto sector pullback—but this dip enhances its “deal” status. Analysts’ consensus price target is $61, a 17% upside, with bulls like Wedbush ($96) citing EV potential and bears like UBS ($56) flagging competition. The stock’s 48% gain over the past year trails the S&amp;P 500’s 55%, keeping it off the radar of momentum chasers.

Risks exist: EV adoption hiccups, potential tariffs under Trump’s administration, and a softening consumer could hit margins. But GM’s $19 billion cash pile, low debt-to-equity (0.33), and 0.92% dividend yield (recently hiked) provide a buffer. Compared to alternatives—say, ExxonMobil (forward P/E 11, slower growth) or Bank of America (forward P/E 12, rate-sensitive)—GM offers a rare mix of value, stability, and upside in today’s pricey market. It’s not flashy, but it’s the best deal fitting your criteria right now.

News: [Trump Tariffs China, Canada, Mexico](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-03-04/trump-tariffs-china-canada-mexico)

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reports preliminary February China deliveries of 30,688 cars, down close to 50% from last year.

**Technicals:** Overall a brutal delivery report. TSLA has been on a slide since post-election highs and frankly shows no real sign of recovery. Looking for a small bounce in this stock but I don't think there is much potential for long-term recovery.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** TSLA's EV sales have been declining in China mainly due to BYD, which are considered to make better cars for far cheaper outside the US. The US has a 100% EV tariff for non-US made EV vehicles.

**Risks:** BYD has been eating TSLA's lunch outside of the US. I truly don't see TSLA retaining dominance as the EV of choice outside the US. 

**Ticker:** [**OKTA (Okta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OKTA&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Okta beat earnings expectations with EPS of $.78 vs $.74,gave guidance that supports EPS of $3.20 vs $2.93. (Also note that CRWD reports today but are not direct competitors)

**Technicals:** Watching $100 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Cybersecurity (more specifically IAM) grows yearly mainly due to RPO and cRPO (remaining performance obligations). This is subscription backlog expected to be recognized over the next 12 months.

**Risks:** Market saturation/pricing concerns from competitors.

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Nvidia is front and center as the stock most affected by tariff concerns.

**Technicals:** Watching $110 level. Note that this is the lowest it's been since September 2024. We have millions of shares come in in the first 2 minutes of the open so watch for that.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Not much to speak of that hasn't been said before, but NVDA is heavily affected by tariffs and the CHIPS Act, with additional scrutiny that it is somehow bypassing export controls and having their chips go into China.

**Risks:** MORE trade disputes, more potential export restrictions, (Trump has cited he wants to strengthen export controls for NVDA).

**Ticker:** [**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&amp;p=d) / [FXI (iShares China Large-Cap ETF)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&amp;p=d) / Other Chinese Stocks

**Catalyst:** China has imposed 15% retaliatory tariffs on select U.S. goods.

**Technicals:** $130 level. Most interesting level I'm watching today.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Tariffs, stimulus from the Chinese government, China has been spending for increased consumer confidence. 

**Risks:** Even greater tariffs, the cash cannon that China is using dies down, less spending by Chinese consumers, etc.

Sales have dropped because model y lines are being retooled, but the new model y has a waiting list. This was a planned simultaneous shutdown of all model y lines for retooling. Thats the way to do it, if you stagger it you get the osborn effect (reduced demand because of the new thing coming) and have to discount old models more. The new y will be strictly better in terms of value vs cost, so this is a good thing.

**NVDA earnings today, will likely decide the fate of the immediate market. It reports at 4:20 ET today!**

News: [China Plans To Start Bank Capital Hike With At Least 55 Billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-26/china-plans-to-start-bank-capital-hike-with-at-least-55-billion)

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)/[**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&amp;p=d)/All Semiconductor Stocks/SMH

**Catalyst:** Some catalysts today: Deepseek cuts API pricing by 75%, NVDA is reporting earnings, ChatGPT is doing a limited rollout of ChatGPT 4.5, META considering $200B AI data center.

NVDA reporting earnings is the main catalyst today and decides the immediate direction of the market.

**Technicals:** Mainly interested in seeing if NVDA misses revenue (unlikely) or if they say anything significant due to new export controls which I talked about yesterday (strengthening of CHIPS Act export controls to China).

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** NVDA leads in semis design, is a multi-billion dollar company, etc.

**Risks:** I'm currently positioned defensively (sold calls against my position since I have a decent cost basis from back when DeepSeek news released, so overall will just sit on hands and get out of my position if the earnings are bad).

**Related Tickers:** INTC, QCOM, ASML

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** (Old news) New report shows demand is falling in Europe, with sales dropping a precipitous 45% in January.

**Technicals:** Massive selloff since post-election highs- $300 was a significant level I was watching at the time and we exploded past that, so interested to see if we're able to hold above it.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** BYD is a major competitor to TSLA and will likely overtake them in the future, and Musk's political actions are seen as controversial in Europe.

**Risks:** Musk.

**Related Tickers:** BYD, and other auto stocks.

**Ticker:** [**COIN (Coinbase)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&amp;p=d)**/**[**HOOD (Robinhood)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&amp;p=d)**/**[**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&amp;p=d)**/Other CC Stocks**

**Catalyst:** The CC market is experiencing a selloff mainly due to proposed tariffs and the hack at Bybit, resulting in the loss of \~$1.5 billion.

**Technicals:** Not too interested in playing this long- still watching to see how we perform but the sell off has continued, waiting for a larger move still.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Hacks increase fear of storing on centralized exchanges (like Coinbase), proposed tariffs affecting digital assets can lead to market volatility. Interestingly enough, ByBit was (theorized) to be hacked by North Korea.

**Catalyst:** China plans to inject at least $55 billion into its largest banks in the coming months as part of a broader stimulus package, Yuan printer go brrrrr. This move is intended to supplement the core Tier 1 capital of China’s six largest state-owned banks. This is the first bank recapitalization since the global financial crisis. 10T yuan (\~$1.4T) debt package to support local government financing and economic stability.

**Technicals:** We've seen a decent upmove on a lot of Chinese stocks due to this, we'll see how the market reacts.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China has been going through a spending crisis, and the government's decision to inject substantial capital into its major banks is a move to strengthen liquidity. This initiative aims to enhance the lending capacity of banks, support local government financing, and stabilize the broader economy. It's a (pre) bailout baby.

**Risks:** This does signal that China sees economic weakness, such as lack of demand due to their real estate sector they've traditionally leaned on for consumer growth/investment. Is this a long term fix? Who knows, but it worked for the US!

**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU

**Ticker: SMCI**

**Catalyst:** They finally filed an hour before the deadline on the final day! Really cutting it close there lol. The company has faced allegations of accounting irregularities. These allegations, along with a failure to file specific financial forms have been a plague for the past year on the stock price. 

**Technicals:** We've seen a 20% move AH, so worth watching at open to see if we move further. Other than that, watching $50/$55 level. We'll see where it goes but worth noting that we've made a significant move back to pre-delisting threat prices already.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Was at threat of delisting from the NASDAQ but now they're safe baby.

**Risks:** People getting out, or the filing being rejected/advised to resubmit. The latter is a massive catalyst but low probability.

Moving money from the US to foreign markets may be smart, but which? And a crash in the US tends to affect the entire world, so while they'd probably be safer, they won't be safe.

I pulled out of the US markets entirely last week before the 4 down days. I just put 1/3 of my portfolio into EUAD which is an ETF of some of the biggest European defense stocks.  I know I'm a few months late on this one. Europe is realizing that it can't count on the US anymore and will have to grow its own defense industry. I'm definitely willing to investigate and invest in smaller defense stocks too. I don't expect it to go nuts, because these are old established companies and their stocks don't move that fast, but I think it's a very safe bet that Europe's defense stocks are going to grow over the next few years.

What are some other examples of trying to adjust to the current situation? Short TSLA? Invest in other EV companies that take some of the post-TSLA hype?

2025-02-24 21:52:28,r/stocks,SHALL WE PLAY A GAME? (I love the 80s..and we are headed back!),"When I say that phrase I hear it in the movie computer voice.  Anyway, I vaguely remember the stock market crash of 1987.  I was young but I used to play a stock trading game on my “IBM Compatible” computer which really wasn’t but that is how they sold you computers back then.  It had a ticker that would scroll across the screen and you could buy and sell stocks in made up companies.

No one really knows where the stock market is heading the rest of the year but I could make a pretty good argument we are moving towards stagflation temporarily.  I can see a scenario of a weakening economy with persistent inflation.  So, if the market were to move negative the rest of the year, what are your picks to see the largest downside moves?

My picks:

TSLA - Obvious reasons…its stock prices is built on a dream that is becoming a nightmare
PINS - Low revenue growth outside the U.S, ADU growth slowing down, It is mostly ads now and almost unusable. 25B market came to 3.5B revenue.
SNAP - 11 years in and still can’t make a profit.  

Also, if federal grant money really does decline, and cuts to Medicaid, pick any public health care stock and buy puts.  If they cancel infrastructure contracts, pick most of the shovel companies like Caterpillar and buy puts.  If they cancel the farmer subsidies, buy puts in John Deere.  So many others that are going to be hurt.

So what is your pick for the largest declining stock of 2025 between 2/25 and 12/31?  ",0,0,Phx-Jay,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ixcnn1/shall_we_play_a_game_i_love_the_80sand_we_are/,1ixcnn1

Palantir has been on a tear recently, all hyped up on the defense sector growth but no one is really paying attention to Meta Defense and their entry to the space. Last year Meta opened up its AI models to defense agencies and contractors. This is huge for them to get this level of clearance and i think this will will put them in direct competition with Palantir. Im not sure how they build out this branch of Meta, Im calling it Meta Defense but they fired all their woke people and are starting to re-shape the company.

Yes, there is defense spending cuts but its all on waste and overcharged contracts not on things that actually matter for the dept of defense. During the inauguration Zuckerberg was in the front row, Hegseth was somewhere in the back. Just an observation.

Everyone is familiar with their social media business so there isnt a whole lot to talk about there. AI keeps improving, More growth from Reels, Threads, Facebook. Their LLM is impressive and arguably one of the best, putting them up there with OpenAI.

With all there user data they have Meta Analytics could be another source of revenue.

They are sitting on a goldmine with Facebook market place. i get they have ads but i feel they could do more.  Im not sure Zuckerberg realized what he has there but this business if monetized right could be HUGE.

I’ve been investing in Canada for the past five years and exclusively use Wealthsimple as my platform. Honestly, I think it’s the best option for Canadians who don’t have USD accounts.

I was able to pay off my student loan through investing, as I started in my first year of my MBA. After clearing my loan in 2023, I resumed investing, and here’s my current portfolio (listed alphabetically) along with the percentage allocation and gains/losses since purchase:



Portfolio Overview:

	•	ENB – 3% (+21%)

	•	FBTC – 2.5% (-9%) Bought a month ago to gain exposure to crypto

	•	ZCN – 1% (+10%)



Questions:

	1.	I currently hold 29 stocks, which seems excessive. Are there any that you’d recommend as an immediate SELL?

	2.	Lately, I’ve been increasing my ETF allocation while reducing exposure to volatile stocks. Does this seem like a solid strategy, or should I continue investing in blue-chip tech stocks to maintain strong returns?

	3.	Any other feedback or recommendations?

2025-02-12 12:59:50,r/TSLA,Not Worried About Tesla At All,"Seeing a lot of FUD lately. As a seasoned investor in Tesla, I've witnessed the rollercoaster that is TSLA's stock journey firsthand. The current chatter about selling or panic seems to predominantly come from bots and those who jumped on the bandwagon at its peak around $480, now witnessing their savings diminish.

Let me share a personal anecdote: a few years back, I liquidated my assets, including my home, and reinvested it all into Tesla during a hype-driven peak of around $280. The stock then plummeted to $120, yet I remained unshaken. Why? Because those who truly understand Tesla's vision see beyond the volatility. 

Consider this historical parallel: investing in Apple during the '90s when its stock hit rock bottom. Those who trusted in Steve Jobs' vision were handsomely rewarded. Tesla is on a similar trajectory, poised to become one of the world's leading companies.

Despite facing significant headwinds from activist short sellers, a mostly hostile media landscape, and global regulatory challenges, Tesla has consistently pushed boundaries. Tesla's product lineup is diversifying further and their investment in vertical integration continues to drop COGS, protecting itself from supply chain issues while simultaneously growing their footprint.

The current dip in stock price is merely a blip in the grand scheme. For those looking at the long-term, Tesla represents not just a stock but an investment in the future of mobility, intelligent automation,  and energy. The narrative is  exponential growth in the coming decade.

My advice, buy now. That's what I'm doing. Buy all the way down and back up. Personally, I think we'll see another stock split before 2030, maybe two.

2025-02-12 05:28:13,r/TSLA,Elon needs to do calm down.,"I love Elon and everything he is contributing to human advancement. But he should understand that if enough people are irritated by what he says, things won’t turn out well—even if the end product is incredible.

I think Elon’s success and his never-give-up attitude, which brought him this far, won’t serve him well in ideological matters. History provides many examples. Here’s a horrible one: under dictator Gaddafi, Libya was a stable and relatively prosperous nation. All he had to do was keep calm and continue his work. But he didn’t, Western propaganda took its toll, and he was ultimately killed by his own people. Now, Libya is a terror-infested failed state (any historian, feel free to correct me if I’m wrong).

People perceive Elon’s companies as an extension of him, and his ego has ensured they remain that way. To hurt Elon is to hurt his companies. Tesla is an unusual company in that its products have traditionally been favored by left-leaning consumers. But now, with the left seeing Elon as a right-leaning figure influencing politics and ideologies, it’s common sense that consumers would opt for the next best alternative, ultimately affecting Tesla’s sales.

The worst part is, I don’t think Elon cares much about what happens to Tesla—at least from a stock standpoint. He seems to believe there are far more important things to worry about, and he’s even willing to risk his companies to achieve them. He’s not necessarily wrong, but he could pursue these goals without harming his companies and investors. If he could set aside his ego and resign from his leadership position at Tesla, instead taking on a design/engineering role, I think people wouldn’t focus so much on Tesla. If not that, then at the very least, he should talk less and focus his energy on DOGE, etc.

2025-02-11 23:20:13,r/stocks,TSLA isn't the NVIDIA of EV's anymore,"

I’m no Tesla expert, and I’m sure plenty of people know way more about the company than I do, but I wanted to throw out some thoughts and see what you all think.



Right now, TSLA is sitting around $330 a share, up 75% YOY. But honestly, I see some major red flags:



📉 Shrinking Profit Margins – Tesla’s margins have been steadily declining for years. Not a great trend.



🏴‍☠️ Musk’s PR Nightmare – Elon literally gave a “Sieg Heil” on live TV. Now, a huge chunk of the world sees him (and by extension, Tesla) as a Nazi. That’s… not exactly great for brand reputation.



🚗 Cybertruck is a Mess – Poor build quality, tons of issues, and at this point, it’s basically a meme.



🌍 New Political &amp; Tariff Risks – Tesla is vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, an anti-EV U.S. President, and a California governor who hates Musk and might pull state EV rebates.



⚡ Serious Competition is Catching Up – Tesla isn’t the undisputed EV/FSD leader anymore. Other companies are matching—or surpassing—them in innovation.



🚦 FSD is Overhyped – Despite all the robotaxi talk, Tesla’s self-driving tech is still only Level 2-3. Meanwhile, other companies already have Level 4 robotaxis on the road.



🔋 Rising Costs = Profit Squeeze – Raw material costs are going up, and Trump’s tariffs on China-made batteries could make things even worse.



🤖 Tesla is Struggling to Attract Top AI Talent – Even before Musk’s latest antics, nearly all top AI researchers and recent ML PhD graduates from the top schools were choosing OpenAI, Anthropic, or GAMMA (Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Apple) over Tesla or xAI. Now? Even fewer want to work there, which could hurt Tesla’s AI progress.



🔵 Losing Left-Leaning Consumers – Left-leaning buyers are way more likely to buy EVs than right-leaning ones. And almost every left-leaning consumer has grown to despise Musk, leading them to choose non-Tesla EVs instead.



Tesla used to be the Nvidia of EVs—they were miles ahead of everyone else. But that’s just not the case anymore. There are more non-Tesla EV options every year, and in terms of FSD, several companies already have a better product and better talent. So, to me, a $1.1 trillion valuation feels ridiculous.

I never expected Musk’s name to be mentioned this frequently in a Fed hearing—it’s starting to feel more like a government innovation forum rather than an economic hearing.

But the **market isn’t taking this as a joke—it’s reacting in real-time**.

Indexes are climbing, but Tesla is underperforming and decoupling from the broader market. If tomorrow’s CPI comes in as expected and rate cut expectations remain low, indexes could reverse downward. That would put Tesla in an even worse position, as it’s already in a downward trend. If the broader market dips, Tesla could see **even steeper losses**.

Considering the **Day 2 hearing sentiment**, expect further volatility. Time to stay alert.

New question:  let's say I'm willing to make a ""bet"" that TSLA goes down in the next 6-12mo... what is the simplest way for me to make that bet?  Do I really have to get into margin accts and short selling?  Basically I'd like to ""mirror"" TSLA for next 12mo.  Is there a simple way to do that or not really?

\---

I'm new to inverse ETFs and have a small position in TSLQ.  I do know that several 'warnings' say that these style investments are meant for intraday, but since it is an ETF I don't understand the risk of holding for weeks or months.  (apart from the obvious, if the tracking stock goes up)  So here's my question, if the hypothesis comes true (that TSLA goes down over next 6mo) what is the risk to just hold TSLQ ETF for that period?

Another way to ask, is there something else going on with the 'tracking' where over longer periods of time the ETF won't track to certain kinds of losses (eg; during after hours or something else...)?  Is it possible that TSLA goes down over a period of time but somehow TSLQ doesn't gain?

Would like to ask for some advice regarding selling off of my TSLA shares. Just for context, here are the deets:

Total shares owned - 132.3853

Average price - $186.28

Cost basis - $24661



Somewhere in 2023 I started selling options on TSLA and my current open positions are

Mar 21 335P

May 16 305C

Like many others, I am bearish on the short term outlook of TSLA and I think it’s time to take some profits and wait to reenter at about my cost price again 


I know many TSLA bulls will taunt me - it’s ok, I’ve made my peace with it if it never drops to my cost as I know there are plenty of other opportunities. I just think that after 2 years.. it’s only right to take some profits now before the price goes below my call. 


I am thinking of 

1. Rolling out and down my put option
2. Taking profits on my odd no of shares (32.3853)
3. Wait for my 305C to be exercised

However, on point 3, i am worried that the price drops too fast and it’ll go below the strike by expiration in May. In that case, would closing the call position early be a wiser decision? Or to make it even more clean cut, close both options and sell off all of my shares? 

I would really appreciate any input from experienced traders here. Thanks for your time! 


Before i get grilled for the weird looking put and call: 


Yeah, i know its weird that my call is lower than put, mismanagement on my part caused me to not roll up my strike in advance of the elections and i was caught with my pants down (had no connectivity, was in the air) and the price went wayyy up. been rolling it up slowly from pre election strike of 250 to this current level, paying bits of debit here and there, which i am ok with.

2025-02-08 03:31:04,r/TSLA,Prediction: TSLA will drop and bounce off 100 DMA in the next week,"Studying the charts and have a prediction.  Next week will be quite ugly as selling accelerates and many capitulate. We will dip slightly below the 100 day Moving Average for a day or two, which is currently at 333 and moving upwards about 1 - 1.5 points a day. Short term bottom will be in sometime in the middle of the week before we start a several-week bounce up to 400 or slightly above, then the next wave will take us much lower to 300 or below.  Basing this on the how the charts looked when TSLA hit a relative high around 300 in July of 2023.  From that high, it downtrended for 9 months to less than 50% of that high in the 140s, so definitely don’t think it’ll reach new highs anytime soon, but a bounce is not too much to expect.  I do expect it to go down to around 250 before the next multi-month uptrend.  Just my analysis and prediction, and I’ll likely be wrong, but I think it’s reasonable…",112,58,OutlandishnessDry365,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1ikcsjg/prediction_tsla_will_drop_and_bounce_off_100_dma/,1ikcsjg

**almost 70%**

There was few things that happened that year, that we might see happening again! except last one.

\-Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter in late 2022 led to concerns that he was too distracted. **(Now his political interest is creating uncertainty and the market hates it).**  
\-Reports of declining orders and price cuts in key markets raised fears that Tesla’s growth was slowing. **(Now the sales plummeting in EU is creating the fear among investors).**  
  
\-Musk sold a significant portion of his shares (around $22 billion in late 2021), causing temporary price drops.

Other than the 22 billion sell off, we have almost same cycle repeating

News: [Us Initial Jobless Claims Pick Up But Stay Relatively Low](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-06/us-initial-jobless-claims-pick-up-but-stay-relatively-low)

**Ticker:** [**F (Ford Motor Company)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Ford Motor Company reports .39 vs .34 expected, revenue of $48.2 vs 43.6B expected. Announces that profit could fall by $2B or more due to tariffs and lower EV demand.

**Technicals:** Pretty much broke the $10 level it's been trading around since August, watching to see if it'll sell off more by the open. Highly/infinitely liquid.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The entire automotive industry is challenged by tariffs. F guided lower for 2025.

**Risks:** Obviously these are one of the bigger movers from Mexico tariffs (most cars are assembled in Mexico then shipped to the US).

**Related Tickers:** GM, TSLA, STLA.

**Offhand Comments:** Ford's outlook reflects the broader industry's apprehension about geopolitical factors affecting operations and profitability. Interesting to see how other car companies react to earnings as well.

**Ticker:** [**ARM (Arm Holdings)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ARM&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** ARM reported EPS of $0.39 vs. $0.34 expected. Revenue of $983 million vs. $959M expected. Buoyed by Deepseek ban news, most likely as well.

**Technicals:** Was down roughly 8% after earnings, but seems to be somewhat recovering after Deepseek news.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Semiconductor sector is experiencing heightened demand, especially after PLTR's comments that the AI train will never stop. We're seeing growth in data center applications, the main driver of semis purchases.

**Risks:** Despite strong performance, Arm's lowered full-year revenue forecast has led to a 6% drop in its shares.

**Related Tickers:** NVDA, AMD, INTC.

**Ticker:** [**RBLX (Roblox Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RBLX&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Roblox Corporation reported earnings with an EPS of -$0.33 vs. -$0.46 expected. Revenue of $988.2M vs. $967.2M expected.

**Technicals:** $50 is the clear level here, note that earnings were released premarket rather than aftermarket yesterday. Seems to be a massive overreaction selloff (but has recovered somewhat).

**Risks:** IIRC Roblox isn't profitable yet- they're focusing on growth/revenue over profits, but most of their costs are outside their control (platform fees like the Apple store, developers, infrastructure for trust/safety for minors).

**Related Tickers:** EA, TTWO.

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, has temporarily suspended its API service top-ups due to server resource constraints. Additionally, U.S. lawmakers plan to introduce a bill to ban DeepSeek's chatbot application from government-owned devices over data security concerns.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The AI industry is under increased scrutiny regarding data security and geopolitical tensions but that's grown more laissez-faire under Trump. DeepSeek's service suspension and potential U.S. government ban helps American chip makers and NVDA especially, due to their continued dominance.

**Risks:** Deepseek getting banned will likely lead to greater reliance on American AI chatbots, spurring growth in American semis manufacturers.

**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM.

**Offhand Comments:** (I am currently long).

**Ticker:** [**SWKS (Skyworks Solutions)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SWKS&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** EPS of $1.60 vs. $1.57 expected. Revenue of $1.07B vs 1.07B expected. Reports $2B stock buyback plan.

**Technicals:** Watching the $60 level, we've had a brutal fall from $90-&gt;$60. If we get closer I'm interested in some small bounce depending on volume/size of the move.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SWKS supplies some of the chips for Apple's iPhone, and their iPhone sales haven't done too well recently- thus this has a knock-on effect by affecting SWKS's sales.

**Risks:** SWKS projected a revenue decline for the mobile segment and issued a lower profit forecast. They stated they anticipated a ""mid-to-high teens decline in mobile.""

**Offhand Comments: A lot of the firms that manufacture parts for the iPhone are linked in performance, especially if the iPhone is the main source of their sales- would be interesting to formulate some trading ideas from that.**

2025-02-04 14:33:23,r/TSLA,The future of Robotaxis,"We already have Robotaxis in a few cities (Waymo). These are highly trained cars limited to a small, heavily trained area. They are statistically  safer than a human driver. Unfortunately, the cost of training and equipment is very high so no way to make a profit (hence GM shutting down their Cruise program). 

Tesla has a different approach. They are using AI and training for every road and scenario. Luckily they have millions of drivers to gather data (and training feedback) for the AI stack. This is a much longer process but in the end will cost a fraction and will work in most areas without much 'refinement training.'

So now Tesla is doing the refinement training for the Austin area and will launch there first. They already have cars leaving the factory and solo driving to a parking lot. They go down a difficult road with various obstacles, etc to park themselves. Of course, the AI stack has a lot of refinement training for this area. 

In fact, Tesla Robotaxis are already in the Austin area. Tesla employees (the brave ones : ) have been using them for a while. 

So Robotaxis are a matter of not if, but when. And they will be safer than a human driver (not that difficult of a bar to beat). And they will cost a fraction of Uber. It will be huge. 

In the short term, they will launch city by city. They will eat away at Uber rides. Then people will realize they can get home piss drunk and will go out drinking more. Some people will trust them enough to send their kids to soccer, etc. 

Yes, it will take some time before the general public will whole heartily embrace a driverless taxi. But the low cost and convenience will win them over sooner or later. Deep down, most people are cheap asses and lazy. 

Value of this? How much is Uber worth? 140 billion. But Robotaxis will be WAY more profitable as no driver cost. And Tesla already has a large fleet of cars that can be converted to Robotaxis. 

Once this takes hold in mainstream society, people will stop buying a second or third car. Non-Tesla car sales will drop substantially. The industry can't handle a drop in sales as fixed costs are too high - so the weak ones will go out of business. 

And just like me with Facebook, you will be almost forced to use a Robotaxi. I was a very early Facebook user but realized it was a waste of time. But I was forced into using it as all family, friend and event information as disseminated on FB. If I didn't use FB, I lost out on being connected to people. 

Remember the part about people being lazy? Well, same thing here. People couldn't bother texting event info. They could just post once on FB and forget about it. 

So one day - one year or ten - into the future, you will be riding in a Robotaxi. 

In the meantime, the news will plaster any crash or malfunction on a Robotaxi as the news is about eyes, not news. A human powered taxi crashing is not big news. 

For people who like to party at venues, imagine a day when you can have a few drinks at home, call a Robotaxi and be safely brought to a bar, sporting event, etc. for a few $$  - and then you can continue to drink as much as you can handle. When you are struggling to walk, you book a Robo home - no worries. For females, no worry an Uber driver to take advantage of your drunkenness. 

Another result will be far fewer drunk drivers on the road. DDs account for 1/3 of accident fatalities. We will see much safer roads that align with the number or Robotaxis or FSD trips. Now the media will have something positive to report on. 

And once this takes hold, insurance rates will change dramtically. Insurance companies are based on statistics (actuary science). They know better than anyone else. People who drive themselves will pay more for insurance. And one day further into the future it will be difficult to - or maybe even illegal - to drive yourself. 

So buy TSLA now so you will have enough money for unlimited Robotaxi rides : )

  
Oh, this same thing will apply to Optimus. It will take longer as there is not much training data but the impact will be 10X Robotaxis. 

Go back to when the Internet started. It was not a big deal. 99% of people didn't use it. The ones that did saw the potential. Look at whenn Google started - looked lame but soon killed all other search (we forget what we used before Google). 

Same with the iPhone. I was one of the first iPhone users. I worked with vairous Samsung entities (including cell phones as they were called back then) and brought my iPhone to show it to execs and staff. Execs said ""Too expensive, no one will buy it."" Meanwhile, the female staff level employees were enthralled with just the photo handling alone. Sometime later, Samsung asked me for help with their new smartphone (Bada OS). Funny. But I was semi-retired, having kids and not living in Korea anymore. And I knew they couldn't produce an OS to save their lives. So I gave that a pass : )

Yes, this is one of those moments in history where life will take a monumental shift.

2025-02-04 04:09:52,r/stocks,Tesla’s Valuation: Speculation or Real Growth? My DCF Insights,"I did a quick and dirty DCF valuation for TSLA, and here’s what I found. I don’t own TSLA individually; I only have exposure through the S&amp;P. However, with recent events, I’ve been wondering why people hold TSLA.

My typical process when looking into a company starts with a DCF to gauge approximately what the company should currently be valued at. I know, I know, it’s not perfect, but it’s a way to get started.

For TSLA, I averaged the last three years of free cash flow (FCF) at about $5.1 billion. I used a 5% FCF growth rate and a terminal growth rate of 3%, along with a discount rate of 12%. All these estimates are generous for a few reasons: the share count is increasing, FCF has declined over the past three years, and the risk is high.

With these assumptions, I came up with a value of $26.24, which is only 6.85% of the current price. This means that 93% of the value is based on future growth and speculation.

Now, many people assume that Tesla will revolutionize humanoid robots and self-driving cars, so I took a more optimistic approach to the DCF. I used a 20% FCF growth rate and a terminal growth of 7%, which is probably unrealistic. Using the same discount rate, I arrived at a value of $52.62. This represents 13.74% of the current value, meaning 86.26% is based on even more future growth and potential.

With all that said, it’s hard for me to understand what people see in this company. Or am I just thinking the wrong way, and it has nothing to do with making money?

Congrats to all the long-term holders who have made a killing! I’d love to hear your thoughts on this.",75,63,TheiaFintech,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ih835v/teslas_valuation_speculation_or_real_growth_my/,1ih835v

2025-01-31 17:07:56,r/TSLA,Is TSLA headed for a gamma squeeze ?,"if bullish sentiment and options activity align then YES ! 

# How a Gamma Squeeze Can Happen in Tesla ($TSLA)

1. **High Open Interest in Out-of-the-Money (OTM) Call Options**
2. If a large number of traders buy **OTM call options** on Tesla, market makers who sell these options must hedge their risk by buying Tesla shares.
3. **Stock Price Moves Up**
4. If Tesla’s stock price rises, some of these **OTM calls move closer to in-the-money (ITM)**, increasing the delta (the sensitivity of an option's price to the stock’s price movement).
5. **Market Makers Adjust Their Hedge (Buy More Shares)**
6. As delta increases, market makers need to buy more Tesla stock to stay delta-neutral, which pushes the stock price even higher.
7. **Self-Fulfilling Feedback Loop**
8. As the stock price increases, more OTM calls become ITM, requiring more hedging (more share purchases), leading to a rapid price surge—a classic gamma squeeze.

# Factors That Can Trigger a Tesla Gamma Squeeze

* **Massive Call Buying**: Retail and institutional traders buying Tesla call options with high open interest.
* **Low Liquidity or High Short Interest**: If there's limited supply, rapid buying can cause a short squeeze alongside a gamma squeeze.
* **Positive Catalysts**: Earnings beats, strong delivery numbers, or major news (like an AI breakthrough, new model release, or Elon Musk's announcements) can trigger initial upward momentum.
* **Weekly Options Expiry (OpEx) Events**: Many traders use short-term options, which can accelerate a gamma squeeze when expiration approaches.",50,42,Distinct-Check-2893,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1iei7bs/is_tsla_headed_for_a_gamma_squeeze/,1iei7bs

* Canada, Mexico tariffs threaten to upend auto, energy sectors

**Thoughts:** We will literally see a decision from Trump tonight regarding whether or not oil will be exempted from the tariffs, otherwise the stocks I'm watching on the OVERNIGHT exchange are F/GM/TM and TSLA/LCID (stands to lose rather than gain if oil is exempted) in addition to all the oil stocks that are standard (OIL, BP, XOM, etc). We might also see some volatility tomorrow at the open, VIX has already spiked but went back to preannouncement levels.

~~EDIT: TARIFFS ARE DELAYED UNTIL MARCH 1ST~~

# [EDIT 2: ANNOUNCEMENT OF TARIFF DELAY HAS BEEN DEBUNKED, STILL CONTINUING ON SATURDAY ACCORDING TO WH PRESS SECRETARY ](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/north-america-braces-new-trump-tariffs-saturday-deadline-nears-2025-01-31/)

&gt;President Donald Trump President Donald Trump said he would follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1, citing the flow of fentanyl and large trade deficits as among the reasons for his decision.

&gt;“We’ll be announcing the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a number of reasons,” Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office as he signed executive actions in response to a deadly airplane collision.

&gt;“Number one is the people that have poured into our country so horribly and so much. Number two are the drugs, fentanyl and everything else that have come into the country. Number three are the massive subsidies that we’re giving to Canada and to Mexico in the form of deficits,” he said.

&gt;West Texas Intermediate oil futures climbed above $73 a barrel following the comments. The US dollar wiped out an earlier loss to touch the day’s high after the remarks, while the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso both plunged. US Treasuries pared their gains.

&gt;Trump indicated the 25% rate could represent a floor, saying that the tariff levels “may or may not rise with time.”

&gt;But the US president did suggest he was still considering if one significant import — oil — would be exempted. Trump said would be making a determination as soon as Thursday evening, basing his decision upon the price of oil.

&gt;“We don’t need the products that they have. We have all the oil that you need. We have all the trees you need,” Trump added, referring to major imports from Canada.

&gt;Trump’s move was closely anticipated by markets as well as global business and political leaders who have scrutinized his words and actions for any indication on whether the US president would deliver on his levy threats or use them as the starting point for negotiations on trade.

&gt;Trump in recent days threatened and then pulled back on tariffs against Colombia in a dispute over deportations of undocumented migrants, leading some to speculate that he was using trade levies merely as leverage to seek policy concessions.

&gt;Trump also indicated that he would proceed with tariffs on China. He didn’t specify the levy, though he’s previously said it would be 10%. Trump has said Beijing failed to follow through on promises to prevent fentanyl and the chemicals used to make the deadly drugs from flowing into the US.

&gt;“With China, I’m also thinking about something because they’re sending fentanyl into our country, and because of that, they’re causing us hundreds of thousands of deaths,” Trump said Thursday. “So China is going to end up paying a tariff also for that, and we’re in the process of doing that.”

&gt;Trump has ordered his administration to investigate whether China complied with a trade deal struck during his first term, setting the stage for tariffs against the world’s second largest economy.

&gt;Following through on tariffs against Canada and Mexico, who are US neighbors, major trading partners, and export markets, threatens to have dramatic economic consequences, rattle markets and potentially launch a trade war by undermining protections from a three-nation free trade agreement.

&gt;Both countries have pledged to respond to any trade levies, including with retaliatory tariffs, even as their leaders sought to assure the US they were addressing border concerns in a bid to defuse the conflict.

&gt;“If these tariffs go into effect, Canada will respond,” Canadian Ambassador to the US Kirsten Hillman said Thursday. “This is not something that we want to do. We do not want to get into a tariff-back-and-forth with the United States. It’s not good for Canada, Canadians and Canadian workers and it’s not good for the United States, Americans and American workers.”

&gt;Hillman said that Canada has responded to Trump’s concerns about the border by clamping down and announcing new security measures, including added drones and helicopters.

&gt;Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort even before the president was inaugurated in a bid to ease tensions between their nations, and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum spoke to Trump to try to avert the levies.

&gt;In the first 11 months of 2024, US trade with Canada totaled $699 billion and $776 billion with Mexico. And the magnitude of tariffs Trump will enact could have stark impacts on particular industries, such as the auto industry and the energy sector. Shares of US automakers Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. turned negative on the announcement, erasing earlier gains.

&gt;“President Trump’s tariffs will tax America first,” Matthew Holmes, executive vice president at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said Thursday. “From higher costs at the pumps, grocery stores and online checkout, tariffs cascade through the economy and end up hurting consumers and businesses on both sides of the border. This is a lose-lose.”

&gt;Trump is also promising sectoral tariffs, such as on pharmaceuticals, semiconductor chips, steel, aluminum and copper, which could apply widely to many countries, including Canada and Mexico.

&gt;The US president is an avowed believer in tariffs, saying they will force a renaissance in domestic manufacturing, though industry groups warn that it will upend supply chains and endanger existing factories by raising costs of source materials.

&gt;He’s hailed tariffs as a source of revenue as lawmakers move to renew and expand expiring tax cuts and approve other credits and benefits the president promised on the campaign trail. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate to 15% for firms that manufacture goods in the US, compared to the current 21% rate.said he would follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1, citing the flow of fentanyl and large trade deficits as among the reasons for his decision.

&gt;“We’ll be announcing the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a number of reasons,” Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office as he signed executive actions in response to a deadly airplane collision.

&gt;“Number one is the people that have poured into our country so horribly and so much. Number two are the drugs, fentanyl and everything else that have come into the country. Number three are the massive subsidies that we’re giving to Canada and to Mexico in the form of deficits,” he said.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

**Today OpenAI may make history. Trying out longer form, more detailed catalyst examinations over the short-form with more tickers.**

**Ticker:** [**META (Meta Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $8.02 vs $6.68 expected. Revenue of $48.4B vs $47B,but guided revenue short of consensus and didn't provide FY25 revenue outlook (which triggered the reason for the selloff post-earnings after the close).

Their CAPEX announcement was $60-65B vs $52.4B expected, and stated they expected the single largest driver of expesive growth in 2025 as infrastructure costs due to higher OpEX and depreciation.

Also announced plans to grow META's AI team significantly.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Earnings move the stock on far less volume but the initial selloff after announcement was worth trading- interested in the $700 level today but not much beyond that.

**Context:** Decent earnings but signals that there is more spending on the horizon- likely that the initial brutal selloff to $606 was from algos just reading the initial eye-popping CAPEX number and selling the company.

**Sector Context:**There is a major next-level breakthrough that OpenAI is expected to release today that has agents performing on the same level as PHDs, Altman is meeting today with US government officials. META is the creator of Llama, which is another open source model compared to OpenAI's closed models.

**Risks:** Deepseek has been the main threat involved, with competitors from China using distillation and other AI techniques to be able to train a far cheaper model that brings up the question of why our large tech firms are spending so much on GPUs. (I'm sure this is news to you /s)

**Related Tickers:** FAANG stocks, SNAP, PINS, etc.

Offhand:  Something worth remembering is that there is a $10B undersea cable that spans over 40K km that they plan to build (unknown what the cable is for), more details coming in 2025. Likely some kind of fiber optic cable.

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.73 vs $0.76 expected. Revenue of $25.71B vs $27.23B expected. Most of this revenue miss came from miss in sale of EVs. 

TSLA announced interesting plans to lower the price of EVs in 2025 but also didn't give specific details regarding the production volume targets (as they have in the past), and also announced that there would be a paid robotaxi service in Austin in June. This puts them in competition with Waymo/UBER. Personally I think the vision-only approach is not viable in the long-run but hey, I'm no self-driving PHD. 

CAPEX was ALSO higher as with META due to spending increases from AI training infra costs and battery production capacity.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in the $375/$400 level, not too interested in going long despite the multi-day slide in price.

**Context:** Main reason for TSLA's selloff was the lack of full-year guidance (it gives the subtext that it's too bad to release publically or it's up in the air). Political statements made by Musk may contribute to future issues for TSLA.

**Sector Context:** Revenue shortfall was caused due to lower-than-expected vehicle deliveries/ increased sale incentives, 496K cars vs 507K exp. China's BYD is rapidly catching up, and the (possible) removal of the US EV tax credit may make EV's more expensive

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical- if the tariffs on EV vehicles imported to the US gets removed, TSLA will face fiercer competition from BYD. Also Elon Musk.

**Related Tickers:** BYD (but mainly trades in China, TSLA isn't as impacted by AI news.)



[**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) (in addition to ARM/AMD/SMH/SOXL/semiconductor stocks)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** The reveal of Deepseek has introduced an AI model that rivals existing solutions but was developed at around $6M. However there's a rumor that Deepseek is actually trained on 50K H100 NVDA gpus.

**Yesterday after the close, there was an announcement Trump officials discussing tightening curbs on Nvidia's China sales.**

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Overall, there's been a massive selloff since NVDA was $150 at the end of last week. Overall interested again if we hit $116, but low confidence we'll sell off again. 

Currently long.

**Sector Context:** Not much to really say about this beyond NVDA having the most advanced chips that are widespread for training because of the CUDA architecture- most people are doubtful that the TOTAL cost was $6M

US Officials are examining export restrictions but China will likely find a way to bypass them as they have previously.

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical, again. Obviously it's very difficult to restrict trade to a country that we have no military presence in or surround, and China is economically far more powerful than those we have attempted trade restrictions on in the past.

*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures rose Thursday as Wall Street digested recent quarterly results from a slew of megacap tech companies. Investors are coming off a losing session after the Federal Reserve held steady on rates.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the broad market index added 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.5%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were fractionally lower.
*****
&gt; Shares of Meta Platforms and Tesla gained 1% and 2%, respectively, while Microsoft shares dipped more than 4% after the companies reported earnings. Meta beat on top and bottom lines, but Microsoft shares faltered after the company’s quarterly revenue forecast disappointed. Tesla shrugged off an earnings and revenue miss. On the other hand, revenue misses from UPS and Caterpillar weighed the indexes down.
*****
&gt; Other “Magnificent Seven” names are set to report in the coming days, with Apple’s results being due for a Thursday release. Amazon will soon follow suit, as the megacap tech company reports next week.
*****
&gt; On Wednesday, all three major averages ended the session lower as a 4% decline in Nvidia weighed on the market. The declines came after the Fed paused its interest rate-cutting campaign, leaving its borrowing rate unchanged in a range between 4.25% and 4.5%. In their post-meeting statement, policymakers noted that inflation remains “somewhat elevated.”
*****
&gt; “The implication is that we’re on hold until the inflation rate goes down, and unfortunately it’s probably not going to go down very much in the several months ahead, so I wouldn’t be looking for rate cuts at the next meeting,” Jeffrey Gundlach, DoubleLine Capital CEO, said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
&gt; “We have a relatively stable place where we’re standing, and it kind of supports the fact that the market is in a calm position right now, and so is [Jerome] Powell apparently,” he said.
*****
&gt; On the economic data front, the fourth-quarter gross domestic product reading is due on Thursday, and weekly jobless claims are out in the morning. Investors are also looking ahead to Friday’s personal consumption expenditures price index report for December.

2025-01-29 04:21:57,r/stocks,Apple and SpaceX Link Up to Support Starlink Satellite Network on iPhones,"**Thoughts:** Obviously good for companies that are involved in the sat comm business (but may be bad/neutral for sat comm companies that do not work with AAPL such as GSAT), TMUS, and AAPL. TSLA is also possibly affected because SpaceX trades as a proxy to TSLA news. VZ/T/other phone providers may be affected but the use case is so niche that I won't hold my breath. 

&gt;Apple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software, providing an alternative to the company’s in-house satellite-communication service.

&gt;

&gt;The companies have been testing iPhones with the Starlink service from Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an under-the-radar move, the smartphone’s latest software update — released Monday — now supports the technology.

&gt;

&gt;The tie-up comes as a surprise: T-Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones, such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple, meanwhile, already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range.

&gt;

&gt;T-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service, and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test.

&gt;

&gt;The first users received text messages from T-Mobile saying, “You’re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.” Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.

&gt;

&gt;An Apple spokesperson declined to comment, while T-Mobile said that the test will “begin with select optimized smartphones” and that the full launch will “support the vast majority of modern smartphones.” T-Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15, the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

&gt;

&gt;Ever since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022, there’s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple’s 2022 announcement, Musk posted on X that his company has “had some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.”

&gt;

&gt;Here’s how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to enable texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple.

&gt;

&gt;The initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple’s Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.

&gt;

&gt;There’s another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option, meanwhile, is designed to work automatically — even when the phone is in a customer’s pocket.

&gt;

&gt;Both the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off-the-grid areas, such as hiking trails, that don’t have cellular service. The capabilities can’t be used in places where a mobile-phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.

&gt;

&gt;T-Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now, the number of users in the beta is minimal, with T-Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple’s announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes, but it didn’t disclose the Starlink support.

&gt;

&gt;SpaceX requested authority to begin beta-testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T-Mobile’s cellular network in November.

2025-01-27 13:06:13,r/stocks,The Case for TSLA: the Business Value,"Many people consider TSLA to be overvalued based on fundamentals. Make no mistake - it absolutely is... based on fundamentals.

The value of TSLA, beyond the Twitter-political volatility, comes from its proven track record in achieving the impossible.

**Breaking Into an Otherwise Unbreakable Car Market**

How many new Western car companies can you recall successfully breaking into the market in the last few decades?

The only real answer is TSLA.

Everything else is bleeding money, a penny stock, or a YouTube car review channel side quest.

**Popularizing an Otherwise Undesirable and Impossible Product**

Before the EV boom, any consideration of a successful EV business would be immediately countered with legitimate concerns.

The car community wouldn't be very excited without their loud 4L V8 engines.

The product would be impossible to make as the batteries would be expensive, heavy, unreliable, and yield a low driving range. If you did get an EV, you wouldn't be able to charge it since there were no charger networks.

Not to mention the expected environmental returns from selling EVs, but generally disrupting the market and directing it towards sustainable energy cars. I love my fuel-hungry loud 6-cylinder German beast, but ICE engines in the mainstream have an expiration date and will eventually become a niche when the larger market transitions to EVs. TSLA takes the credit for this - singlehandedly. Everybody else follows.

**Scaling Up: Actually Selling Cars**

Tesla is [still leading](https://www.automotivedive.com/news/electric-vehicle-sales-us-2024-increase-cox-automotive/737528/) EV sales, and is in the [top 10](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/06/top-10-best-selling-cars-in-the-us-in-2023.html) of all car sales. Meanwhile, VW is closing down their factories in Germany.

**Advertisement by Word of Mouth**

You see Ford Focus 1.0 EcoBoost billboard ads everywhere in Europe, and RAM / JEEP / Chevy Silverado / F-150 / Hyundai / Kia ads everywhere in the US.

TSLA built itself on word of mouth and a vision for the future, which is a testament to its value for customers.

**Elon's Proven Track Record in Business**

[Winning](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/science/spacex-moon-nasa.html) NASA award contracts in competition with Blue Origin and other space companies, [catching](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp66ye6ep63o) skyscraper sized objects landing, and a Roadster [roaming](https://www.astronomy.com/science/astronomers-just-deleted-an-asteroid-because-it-turned-out-to-be-elon-musks-tesla-roadster/) through space are just a few of the business and technological achievements of Elon Musk (not to mention the side quests). With someone so unreasonably effective at building things that work, investors project that TSLA is a safe and promising bet.

How many reusable rockets has anybody else caught landing recently?

**Criticisms**

No product or company is without criticisms. From the bad build quality, to the still-unfulfilled FSD promises, to the lack of Cybertrucks in Europe, to the removal of the turn signal stalks; and most recently, the political criticisms.

**Consequential Actions, Not Ideologies, Drive the World**

The bottom line for a business is creating products and services that people love, and there are *zero* indicators that TSLA, as a business, is going anywhere. It thrives *despite* all criticism (of which I do think most is reasonable) and lack of marketing, which is a testament to the value they provide.

**Market Temper Tantrums Are a Feature, Not a Bug**

Look beyond the ephemeral temper tantrum-driven volatility of the market.

Last year, in March, GOOG dipped from 160 to 135 when Gemini generated some questionable images; today it's close to ATH at &gt;200.

Last year, in August, CRWD dipped from 380 to 220 when they pushed out a buggy update. (How dare they, a software company, pushing a buggy update?!) Today, it's trading close to ATH again.

Today, the market finally noticed DeepSeek and is going through yet another mental breakdown.

It is like a palm tree: it will bend but it won't break.

Learn to put your prejudices aside and buy companies that execute well - not companies with a nice little PR team that will sweet talk you.

**But Is It Overpriced?**

By traditional fundamentals analysis - of course it is. But we've already established there's nothing traditional about TSLA as a company, so your little P/E ratio calculations won't work. They have failed consistently.

Look at the execution of TSLA and compare it to its Western competitors - they aren't even in the same league.",0,0,Ordinary-Experience,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ib78ft/the_case_for_tsla_the_business_value/,1ib78ft

Anyone who was around at the time can testify that this really did represent consensus opinions in this sub at that time, which you can see in the comments of that post.  Note that the game store madness did not really begin until a couple weeks later, which is why it did not appear there.

I felt like it was going to play out poorly so I bookmarked it, and now have been doing yearly updates.  After all, for something like this, you really need to give it a multiple year timeline at least.

We are now on year 4, and to date I have sarcastically remarked about how the sharp, financial geniuses of the time performed against SPY and VTI.  This year I was rather surprised at the results.  All 2025 numbers use the prices right now.

*I used a $100,000 initial investment and just rounded all the prices to the dollar for visual simplicity (all entries use the real, full prices, I have just rounded them for this table).  This also backtracks prices from stock splits.*

2025-01-23 05:56:29,r/TSLA,"Tesla to significantly raise prices of all cars in Canada, website shows","Jan 22 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab will raise prices of all its cars in Canada from Feb. 1, according to notices on its Canadian website, with prices of Model 3 going up by as much as C$9,000 ($6,254.78).

Model Y variants will see increases of up to C$4,000, while all versions of Model S and X will rise by C$4,000, according to the website.

Tesla did not provide a reason for the price increase.

The company does not produce cars in Canada and imports from other factories. It was not immediately clear how many cars Tesla exports to Canada from its Shanghai, China factory and its plants in the United States.

The company did not respond to Reuters' request for comment outside regular business hours.

The unexpected move by Tesla to raise prices comes as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reiterated on Tuesday that his government was ready to respond if U.S. President Donald Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb 1.

My account was up 243% last year and largely due to TSLA (TSLL)... some other plays too. But TESLA is my highest conviction play, let me share.

In my mind it’s financially irresponsible to not own at least some TSLA. The opportunity cost is too much to play the other side. Tesla is going to the biggest company in the world In my opinion, between FSD, energy storage, robo taxis, they are in the middle of multiple S curves which all project to be worth much more than the current valuation. TESLA is not just a car company, we all believe that otherwise we wouldn't be here. People don't realize that the energy sector of Tesla is growing at an unprecedented rate.

*Why TSLA (skip this and go to the trading info if you don't wanna read)*

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FSD: if you never been in a fsd Tesla, find a way to get in the seat of one. Self driving is here, robotaxis already exists with WAYMO. So the stage is set. The market is already proven. Tesla imo is the leader of the front on that. With them being able to license it out, have their own fleet of robotaxis, the chargers. All of that will pay massive margins.

Optimus: the human robot, maybe farther away then the robotaxis, but still within reach, I believe we are in the AI revolution, just like the insurstiral revolution , the tech boom, this will be the next thing. AI is here. Energy storage: with ai and all these need for data centers. America’s energy infrastructure is far from adequate to handle this kind of new demand. I don’t believe they will be the leader of that sector, but the margins on their batteries is enough to add to the bottom line that’s for sure Elon musk is now in the white house for all intents and purposes. I bet on the man well before that. Name a time when it was smart to bet against him.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is how I allow Tesla's volatility make me money: I WHEEL TSLA: First off, I wheel TSLL instead of TSLA because of the added leverage = more premiums. Tsla obviously less volatile, more capital intensive. Pretty much the market is saying “oh your opinion on tsla didn’t change since last week, still think it’ll be above 35.70 (TSLL) at some point, here’s 200$ for not changing your opinion”. My goal is to use the premiums to acquire shares.

I don't know if it will take 1 year or 3 years or 5 years for tesla to get cyber cabs, so I make money owning shares and selling covered calls. You may ask, why cap the upside if your bullish on TESLA? I have long term shares in another account, but I am capitalizing on the volatility that Elon gives us (it's a gift). Tesla won't always go up (in the short term), so I want to make money on the downside, and get PAID to own tesla for cheaper- i am always looking to buy shares.

I also plan to start accumulating more of actual $TSLA next year and slide off off the leveraged ETFs. It was a great year for them. Need to get off them before the gains decay away. There's more detail to this strategy if you have any questions I'd be happy to respond.

Let me know your thoughts and if this seems like a reasonable way to capitalize on TESLA and it's volatility!",100,80,PG-Investments,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1i7chqo/thanks_tsla_and_elon_for_15k/,1i7chqo

In recnt times, it seems like the 4 stocks i mentioned had really amazing runs (very little precedence i'd say,for,such huge runs over,a medium length period, and eapecially for mega-caps)..  w​as there very little bad news,associated with them? Or,did investors create their bubble-like returns to some degree absent specific good news much of the time (i mean absence,of bi-weekly specific good news)

2025-01-21 21:15:44,r/TSLA,Elon Musk is not a Nazi,"(Bullish post because the stock went down today due to trading algorithms sensing a bunch of negative news surrounding Elon and it's stupid and temporary)

He didn't do the nazi salute. Why? Because he said that's not what he intended to do. You can speculate all day about it but at the end of the day a real nazi from the 1940s would be proudly throwing up a Hitler salute, saying how much they love Hitler, saying that yes they absolutely did intend to do a nazi salute, and then probably tell you how much they hate jews.

The media implying that these 2 things are the same is ridiculous. Believing that Elon Musk is a nazi without hearing him out is ridiculous. We need to bring back giving people reasonable benefit of the doubt. A nazi is not someone who puts their arm in the air for any reason. A nazi is a fascist, genocidal maniac who goes and actively tries to exterminate all Jewish people.

Elon Musk is not a nazi. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. And if someone tells me they didn't intend something they did a certain way I will generally beleive them because that's basic human decency.

And especially because Elon is openly very pro Israel. If he were a nazi don't you think he would be supporting Palestine and/or hamas? There are a lot of people who openly support Palestine over Israel so it's not like it's an incredibly unpopular stance to take. This is why the ADL supports Elon and does not think he is a Nazi:

I would love to hear from the community and have a in-depth conversation from ya'll. Thank you &amp; enjoy!

# Macro Overview:

**Electric Vehicle Growth**

The U.S. EV market is projected to show annual growth of 10.54% from 2025-2029, resulting in a market value of $156.3 billion by 2029 [according to Statista.](https://www.statista.com/outlook/mmo/electric-vehicles/united-states) Unit sales alone are projected to reach 2.32 million units by 2029 as well. Consumers now have significantly more choices when shopping for an electric vehicle. They can choose from offerings by [Tesla](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/), [Ford](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/), [GM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM/), [Honda](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HMC/), Hyundai, and many others.

EV's often have unique aesthetic and maintenance needs that typically have high-quality protective films and coatings. The growth in consumer adoption of EV's coincides with Xpel products, particularly on the impact in the aftermarket. EV owners value vehicle preservation. This creates a growing market share for XPEL'S products. These products also include heat-reducing window films that indirectly enhance battery performance.

**Aging Vehicles**

The average car or truck on the road in the U.S in 2024, was more than 12.6 years old, a new record according to [S&amp;P Global](https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/fuel-for-thought-average-age-vehicles-2024.html#:~:text=Vehicles%20on%20the%20road%20are,by%20two%20months%20over%202023.). Consumers now choose to keep cars longer than they used to. This is largely because of the increases in new vehicle prices. As these older vehicles age, the demand for general maintenance and preservation are more-likely to rise.

Car price increases have climbed for four consecutive months, according to [Kelley Blue Book data](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/after-4-straight-months-price-increases-new-car-now-costs-nearly-50000). As of December 2024, the average price of a new vehicle was $49,740, the second-highest level ever recorded. Economic uncertainty and higher costs can discourage new purchases. This situation favors repairs and maintenance of existing vehicles as the fleet continues to get older before replacement.

**Technological advancements**

[Self-healing films](https://www.xpel.com/products/paint-protection-film/ultimate-plus?srsltid=AfmBOopjFd4lU0Io05gEI-r8EsK9Z7gIDE7DRjI1mI7yEhQAFqPDeofN) from XPEL and competitors [3M](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MMM/), [Eastman Performance Films](https://www.eastman.com/en/who-we-are/locations/fieldale-va-usa), and [STEK Automotive](https://www.stekautomotive.com/) were released much earlier. They have recently gained traction as consumers want paint protection film to protect their vehicles. Self-healing films use polymer capable of automatically repairing minor scratches and abrasions when exposed to heat. As vehicles on the road become increasingly older, the demand for reduced effort in maintaining a vehicle's exterior will increase. Vehicle owners will likely seek easier maintenance solutions with minimal effort that repel against water, dirt, and scratches more easily. Consumers and manufacturers are increasingly adopting self-healing films. People who want to protect their older vehicles find XPEL appealing. It is also chosen to keep luxury cars in pristine condition.

# Investment Thesis:

XPEL is a compelling investment with an attractive growth story in the automotive sector. It is supported by a strong brand presence, international expansion growth, and financial strength. With high expectations, investors should take notice in the premium valuation risks apparent. Long-term growth is certainly compelling but there are clear short-term headwinds including macroeconomic uncertainties that require careful monitoring.

* **Product Diversification:** XPEL is widely known for their paint protection films. These films contribute to 70% of total Q3 sales and grew by 2.7%. Still, products like their window film and ceramic coatings have outperformed with growth of 20.6%. [Non-automotive products](https://s204.q4cdn.com/619560229/files/doc_presentations/2024/11/Q3-2024-XPEL-Investor-Presentation.pdf) like home &amp; office window films, antimicrobial film, and niche surface protection film also out-performed by 11.6%. Together, both segments contributed 30% to total sales. Impressive growth outperformance though has largely been a significant reason for overall revenue growth in recent quarters.
* **International Expansion:** U.S. sales are the largest contributor to total revenue, accounting for 57.2% of the total and reaching $64.6 million in Q3, reflecting year-over-year growth of 9.4%. Despite the reliance on U.S. sales, International sales continue to outperform. Canada is the second largest contributor at 12.8% of revenue with growth of 25.7% to $14.4 million. All international markets saw growth except for the third largest market which is China. China saw a significant decline of -11.6% to just $9.06 million. The decrease was primarily attributed to XPEL's distributor working through excess inventory levels. With only a weighting of 8% of total sales, the negative growth did not hurt overall sales significantly. While XPEL faced challenges in China as well as minor growth of 4.1% and 1.4% in Europe and the U.K, strong international performance lead to record revenue.
* **Strategic Partnerships:** XPEL has established multiple strategic partnerships to expand its market presence. Recent collaborations with brands like [Tesla](https://lp.xpel.com/tesla-window-film), [Kia](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241030688212/en/XPEL-Showcases-New-Products-and-Collaborations-at-SEMA-2024), exclusive [Rivian](https://s204.q4cdn.com/619560229/files/doc_news/XPEL-and-Rivian-Expand-Collaboration-With-New-PPF-and-Window-Film-Program-2024.pdf) supplier partnership, [BMW](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241030688212/en/XPEL-Showcases-New-Products-and-Collaborations-at-SEMA-2024), and [Team Penske](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelharley/2024/07/10/xpel-partners-with-team-penske-to-protect-indycars-and-drivers/) have been formed. These collaborations, including with service providers like [Tint World](https://www.tintworld.com/news-media/news-and-press/industry-leaders-tint-world-and-xpel-announce-partnership/), have strengthened market presence. Brand visibility and revenue growth have also increased as a result. The Tesla partnership in particular is of major importance due to their dominance in the EV market. These recent collaborations integrate XPEL's wide array of products into solutions for high-profile vehicles and events. The partnerships with Tesla and Rivian are particularly significant. They expand their reach into the electric vehicle market that continues to rapidly grow in the U.S. and internationally.

# Risk Factors:

* **Reliance On Chinese Distribution:** [Potential tariff threats to China](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-importers-rush-goods-china-trump-tariff-threat-looms-2025-01-15/) from a new administration will significantly impact XPEL if enacted. If new tariffs are applied, XPEL will be faced with increases in far materials leading to higher production costs. With the U.S market as the largest source of revenue at 57.2%, passing on further costs to consumers would likely reduce demand. Most importantly, reliance on one distributor could lead to supply chain constraints due to an over-reliance on one company. Price increases or delayed deliveries would harm relationships and hurt XPEL's brand.
* **The Culper Research Short Report:** On October 19, 2023, [Culper Research issued a short report](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/cc91fda7-4669-4d1b-81ce-a0b8d77f25ab/downloads/Culper_XPEL_10-19-2023.pdf?ver=1733419998410) sending XPEL's stock retreating -17.3% from $51.51 per share to $42.61. A notable accusation was XPEL's understated reliance on Tesla. [XPEL responded](https://ppfmag.com/short-seller-targets-xpel/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) by stating Tesla represented just 5% of 2023 revenue. Secondly, Culper believes XPEL is concealing a massive risk. Their primary supplier, ""Entrotech, Inc"", has formed a [joint venture with PPG Industries](https://news.ppg.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2023/PPG-launches-paint-films-solutions-for-automotive-and-industrial-customers/default.aspx) on May 23, 2023. Lastly, Culper's claim as seen below, would have massive repercussions for XPEL if they are correct.
* **Additional Culper Info:** The validity of Culper's claims on XPEL and others have been [called into question many times](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/827876/000166357721000030/ex99_1.htm) for self-benefiting public statements. What we do know for sure is the joint venture with PPG Industries is in fact truthful. The extent of which XPEL will become obsolete on the other is a highly questionable take. For some reason, Culper did not mention that XPEL stands out due to their DAP software. It is not because of the PPF raw material. Hence, XPEL would know exactly how much material and company their products were installed on. These allegations were made in 2023. XPEL has continued to show strong growth. The company has not skipped a beat.

# Conclusion

XPEL offers an attractive growth story in the automotive industry. This growth is supported by their strong market position and international expansion. The company also has a diverse product portfolio and strategic partnerships. A P/E ratio of 23.98 certainly wouldn't be viewed as cheap by any measures. Still, their P/E is significantly below their five-year average P/E of 41.6. Long-term growth remains compelling with the expectation of double-digit growth in the next two years.

Nonetheless, there are near-term headwinds. Sure, XPEL has displayed a history of growth, but near-term macroeconomic uncertainties regarding tariff concerns are worth monitoring. XPEL must consider how to react to such challenges since their distributor is based in China. For the reasons noted above, we still believe XPEL is a compelling BUY. It offers long-term sustainable growth, strategic partnerships, international expansion, and a strong balance sheet.",14,12,Reasonable-Green-464,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i6ij9n/xpel_analyzing_growth_potential_in_the_automotive/,1i6ij9n

2025-01-17 07:05:04,r/TSLA,Elon Musk and the far-reaching consequences of his behaviour...,"Interesting fact... I just read an article in a Slovak newspaper about the new exciting Tesla Model Y Juniper starting production in Berlin. And everyone commenting there said they are not going to buy anything from Musk anymore (fascist supporting extremists in Europe etc etc...). Just for the fact, we are a small European country and yet I'm surprised by how many people are disgusted by Musk's behaviour. Now I have no doubts, that his behaviour is absolutely alienating customer base and it's primary reason behind massive decline in sales in Europe. The US most likely will see a big drop this year as well with a $7500 tax incentive most likely dropped. I doubt a new Juniper will change much... That leaves only China. If it weren't for China, the drop in deliveries in 2024 would be so big, that the stock would probably be trading in more car-manufacturer P/E levels (and we shouldn't forget that last year includes ramping up of production for Cybertruck). And now we are entering Trump era. He will most likely start a trade war with China. Tesla's biggest market being what? Of course China. Now I know many people will say that the Gigafactory is in China in Shanghai and won't be affected by tarrifs as such. But we all know that China has no problem going against big corporations (e.g. Alibaba). Just to punish the US for tarrifs and Tik Tok ban and their attempt to kill everything Chinese in the US? Musk being the biggest ally of Trump, he can easily be targeted by the Chinese government. I don't have a good feeling about all this. Trump falling out with Musk is another thing. And don't forget it takes fully functional software and hardware for Tesla to truly deliver and justify the valuation of T$LA. Knowing Musk, he will push for unsupervised FSD at the end of this year to avoid another blow to investors' hopes. And it will only takes one major failure of the software, even if only one in 10,000 miles to halt the progress they're making. Even if they don't get a scrutiny from regulators as before, the public opinion matters. Their reputation because of Musk's behaviour and some media-outlets going all out to publish every possible news-worthy articles to dictedit Tesla can hurt the brand and their ambitions so much, that it can completely halt the progress they're making. Musk's behaviour coupled with many haters out there is a recipe for disaster, if you ask me... I don't see FSD software adoption coupled with profit from robotaxis to be as high as Musk claim it could possibly be. There's still Waymo (if people perceive Waymo as the totally safe fully autonomous vehicle they will still pay for it, even if it will cost more than Cybercab), then there's Zoox that will launch soon and can take 4 people at once and all Chinese companies that already have robotaxi services in China, meaning the competition can be pretty big overseas... All I'm trying to say is that there are so many things that can go wrong this year. And the valuation of T$LA is so big, that there's no room for an error.",209,146,elysium_pictures,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1i39yn3/elon_musk_and_the_farreaching_consequences_of_his/,1i39yn3

I totally put it out of my head to the point I somehow thought I had sold all of them for years. 

A few years ago I start getting calls from my Edward Jones guy but I ignore them because I thought they just needed an address update. 

Finally I answer and he tells me that my stock is doing extremely well. I was blown away to realize I had any!! And way more than I expected due to the split. 

I’m still holding strong and wondering if I should pick a number to sell at or if I want to hold for another 10 years. 

It is so so volatile I’m torn. I would absolutely hate to leave it alone and it disappear. 

But I’d also hate to take it out and then it eventually go way high. 

I know there’s no way to accurately predict these things but I have to ask…

2025-01-14 01:21:10,r/stocks,China Discusses Sale of TikTok US to Musk as One Possible Option,"Bloomberg: Chinese officials are evaluating a potential option that involves Elon Musk acquiring the US operations of TikTok if the company fails to fend off a controversial ban on the short-video app, according to people familiar with the matter.

Beijing officials strongly prefer that TikTok remains under the ownership of parent ByteDance Ltd., the people say, and the company is contesting the impending ban with an appeal to the US Supreme Court. But the justices signaled during arguments on Jan. 10 that they are likely to uphold the law. Senior Chinese officials had already begun to debate contingency plans for TikTok as part of an expansive discussion on how to work with Donald Trump’s administration, one of which involves Musk, said the people, asking not to be identified revealing confidential discussions.

A potential high-profile deal with one of Trump’s closest allies holds some appeal for the Chinese government, which is expected to have some say over whether TikTok is ultimately sold, said the people. Musk spent more than $250 million supporting Trump’s re-election, and has been tapped for a prominent role in improving government efficiency after the Republican takes office.

Under one scenario that’s been discussed by the Chinese government, Musk’s X — the former Twitter — would take control of TikTok US and run the businesses together, the people said. With more than 170 million users in the US, TikTok could bolster X’s efforts to attract advertisers. Musk also founded a separate artificial intelligence company, xAI, that could benefit from the huge amounts of data generated from TikTok.

Chinese officials have yet to reach any firm consensus about how to proceed and their deliberations are still preliminary, the people said. It’s not clear how much ByteDance knows about the Chinese government discussions or whether TikTok and Musk have been involved. It’s also unclear whether Musk, TikTok and ByteDance have held any talks about the terms of any possible deal.

Musk and his representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Musk posted in April that he thinks TikTok should remain available in the US. “In my opinion, TikTok should not be banned in the USA, even though such a ban may benefit the X platform,” he wrote on X. “Doing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. It is not what America stands for.”

ByteDance and TikTok representatives didn’t respond to messages seeking comment. The Cyberspace Administration of China and China’s Ministry of Commerce, government agencies that could be involved in decisions about TikTok’s future, also didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The talks in Beijing suggest that TikTok’s fate may no longer be in ByteDance’s sole control, said the people. Chinese officials recognize they will face tough negotiations with the Trump administration over tariffs, export controls and other issues, and they see the TikTok negotiations as a potential area for reconciliation, they said.

The Chinese government holds a so-called golden share in a ByteDance affiliate that gives it influence over the company’s strategy and operations. TikTok maintains that the control only applies to the China-based subsidiary Douyin Information Service Co., and has no bearing on ByteDance operations outside China. Still, Beijing’s export rules prevent Chinese companies from selling their software algorithms, like the one integral to TikTok. Because the Chinese government would have to approve of a sale that includes TikTok’s valuable recommendation engine, it has a significant voice in any possible deal.

TikTok’s US operations could be valued at around $40 billion to $50 billion, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Damian Reimertz estimated last year. That’s a substantial sum even for the world’s richest person. It’s not clear how Musk could pull off such a transaction, whether it would require the sale of other holdings, or whether the US government would approve. He paid $44 billion for Twitter in 2022, and is still paying off sizable loans.

Musk has a positive reputation among many ByteDance employees in China, according to a person familiar with the matter. He is seen as a very successful entrepreneur, who has experience engaging with the Chinese government through his Tesla Inc. business, the person added.

ByteDance’s leaders have repeatedly said their priority is to fight US legislation that requires the Beijing-based company sell or shut down the US operations because of national security concerns. TikTok’s lawyers have argued the legislation violates free speech laws under the Constitution’s First Amendment.

A majority of the Supreme Court justices suggested the security concerns take priority over free speech, although they have yet to issue a formal decision. President-elect Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, has sought to delay the TikTok ban — which takes effect Jan. 19 — so he can work on the negotiations. He has said he wants to “save” the app and there’s been speculation he could take last-minute action to sidestep the ban.

On a practical level, spinning off TikTok’s US business would be highly complex, affecting shareholders in China as well as the US. Lawyers for TikTok argued before the Supreme Court that separating the US portions of the product would be “extraordinarily difficult.”

It’s unclear if US TikTok would be sold off in a competitive process, or if a sale would be arranged by the government. Billionaire Frank McCourt and “Shark Tank” investor Kevin O’Leary are part of a bid through Project Liberty to acquire TikTok, which O’Leary has said he discussed with Trump. In the past, Microsoft Corp. had sought to acquire the business, and Oracle Corp. has a deep technology partnership with the company.

One alternative for TikTok would be to move its existing US customers over to a similar app — with different branding — to potentially sidestep the ban, one of the people said. It’s not clear how effective such a move would be.

One person close to the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the strategy, said before the Supreme Court hearing that the legal battle is still the focus of top executives and they would prefer to keep fighting in the US rather than sell TikTok US and cede control for good.

Musk is in a position to influence the China-US relationship as the world’s richest person with businesses that straddle the world’s two largest economies. Tesla, where Musk is chief executive officer, erected a sprawling factory in Shanghai in 2019 and has since expanded the facility into the company’s largest production base. The effort helped Tesla expand its market share in China despite tough local competition, and build goodwill with government officials.

While Trump is staffing his incoming administration with China hawks like Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio, Musk has spoken out against some recent China trade policies, including the Biden administration’s tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles.

2025-01-04 14:17:56,r/stocks,Arcadium Lithium says shareholders approved Rio Tinto deal,"Shareholders of Arcadium Lithium have given the green light for a $6.7 billion sale to Australian mining heavyweight Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), as announced by the company on Monday.

This news was met with positivity in the stock market, with Arcadium's shares climbing over 2% in after-hours trading.

However, the path to the deal is not without its obstacles. Arcadium is currently dealing with legal challenges from a section of its shareholders.

These shareholders have lodged lawsuits against the company, accusing it of misrepresentation, concealment, and negligence in relation to the takeover deal. This information was disclosed by Arcadium in a regulatory filing earlier this month.

Earlier in the year, Rio Tinto stated its intention to acquire Arcadium at a price of $5.85 per share, which was paid in cash. This purchase price represented a nearly 90% premium on Arcadium's closing stock price on October 4, the day a potential deal was first reported by Reuters.

The acquisition will grant Rio Tinto access to Arcadium's lithium mines, processing facilities, and deposits located in Argentina, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

Additionally, Rio Tinto will also inherit Arcadium's customer base, which includes major automotive manufacturers such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), BMW (ETR:BMWG), and General Motors (NYSE:GM).",12,3,coinfanking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hte6xi/arcadium_lithium_says_shareholders_approved_rio/,1hte6xi
2025-01-04 09:04:26,r/stocks,Is it worth it to invest time into learning technical analysis? ,"For context, I've been buying stocks and options since I turned 18 around 3 months ago, so I don't have a lot of experience or knowledge in the first place. I've just been making moves based on my own research combined with other people's ideas. I was looking through a discord where people share their ideas as I wanted to expand my portfolio past being 65% NVDA and 35% random bullshit, and I often see these pictures of daily 5 minute candles with countless horizontal, diagonal, and curvy lines. The poster then mentions various names for some candlestick patterns and says something about how the stock closed above/under the EMA or some crap then proceeds to justify their following move, seeming to have full confidence because of this chart they drew.

So I thought, if I could go by the book and use rules and numbers to get a solid guess on which way the stock's gonna go, I'd be rich. But if it were that easy, everyone would be rich. And one look through this r/wallstreetbets makes it clear that there's not a lot of people who have achieved that status.

I'm posting to ask if learning about all this is worth it. I know that the market is unpredictable and there's no way looking at a bunch of lines will give me a positive winrate, but does it help? For example, could you have a better chance at guessing what's gonna happen in the next 30 minutes if you recognized the pattern that came before it? I know that I cannot expect the book to be right all the time, but would it at least give me a better shot at it?

I haven't tried this at all and so far I've been doing fine, though I know the stuff I've bought have been nice to me in the months I've held it and I can't expect the same in the future (I started with 7k, now at 9k, with 50% of gains unrealized from mostly NVDA and RKLB, 50% of gains realized from TSLA and NVDA calls bought post-election). I know reading these patterns won't help in the long run, as I'm holding shares and am not planning to sell in the foreseeable future, but I want to understand what these people are talking about when they do TAs and try it for myself to see if it actually helps or not. Maybe try buying 0dte for SPY and QQQ to harvest some loss porn for WSB.

They pull in, it starts smoking from underneath, classic lithium battery fire behavior then in the first frame of the explosion it looks like it's coming from underneath the cybertruck then the explosion triggers the fuel and fireworks, not the other way around.

However, on the way back, the snow intensified, and the wind picked up significantly. This caused the front cameras to struggle with visibility, making it hard for the system to detect the road properly. As a result, the car notified me that FSD was unavailable and required human intervention.

This experience highlights a key limitation of Tesla’s vision-based system—extreme weather can significantly impact its effectiveness.

It’s clear that human intelligence is still far superior when it comes to recognizing and handling complex, unpredictable situations. FSD has made impressive strides, but it still has a long road ahead.

If you exclude this, tslas actual PE is 235 with a trillion dollar market cap. Insane. 

regulatory credit sales accounted for 43% of Tesla’s profit during the first three quarters of 2024, as the company earned $2.1 billion from these credits. This revenue stream has been critical to Tesla’s profitability, especially as it generates nearly pure profit due to minimal associated costs

To calculate Tesla’s P/E ratio excluding regulatory credits, we adjust net income by removing revenue from these credits. For 2024, Tesla earned $2.1 billion from regulatory credits through Q3. Assuming a current P/E of ~118.88, excluding these credits would significantly increase the P/E ratio since net income would be lower.
For example, if Tesla’s annual net income is approximately $8 billion (based on recent quarters), excluding $2.1 billion in credits reduces it to $5.9 billion.

2024-12-26 15:59:28,r/TSLA,Macro economic understanding ,"TSLA has increased as a store of value. It goes up because more people put money into it. That’s the nature of a speculative play. As soon as it stops going up people won’t hold onto it as it retreats to its fundamental valuation. There was a ton of money pumped into the economy to save it after COVID and new online brokerage firms like robinhood enabled a huge swath of the population to pour in capital. New capital seeking outsized returns went where capital could concentrate fastest with a broad thin basis of justification. Every dollar that follows increases returns motivating more people to jump in. It keeps going up as long as there is dumb money to put into it, not based on an actual valuation of the company. This is why it goes up until it doesn’t. When there is no more dumb money in the economy to put into TSLA it won’t grow more. They aren’t pulling back when more dumb money flows in because it reinforces their position. They disregard the idea that it cannot go up forever because they have seen it go up for so long. But the economy is finally contracting. There will be less money in the economy  in the next few years as the recovery from Covid finally ends and inflation and the amount of capital slows. When there is no more money to put into the pyramid, it will fall. The psychology then becomes are you willing to hold on to losses as it plummets to what its actual value is over the course of a year? That money could be placed in companies that have less risk and are actually growing. If you think about it, you’ll know that people will have more pressure to sell the more overvaluated it has become after it’s reached its max point and turns bearish. There is more money in the markets than there is value people ar willing to accept. Ask yourself if you’d buy a bond?",29,26,mtstl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1hmq00e/macro_economic_understanding/,1hmq00e
2024-12-26 07:38:29,r/TSLA,High PE and large market caps aren’t a thing outside TSLA,"Most of you fail to understand market capitalization. High PE ratios can work if you are a small company but tsla is unique in its scale and the expected growth. No company has ever been this big with such an outsized PE. No where close. Enron was a disaster because it cooked its books to get people to overvalue the company. But TSLA investors are overvaluing the company knowing full well the fundamental disconnect.

The increase in the value of TSLA just Tuesday was almost double the total capitalization of Enron. The increase in merely one day on Tuesday is more than 7 times the gdp of Nicaragua. Its total market capitalization is comparable to some of the entire GDPs of the largest countries in the world, more than Mexico and comparable to Brazil and South Korea. 30% of the entire nasdaqs growth in the last two months have been from TSLA. Yet it has been decreasing in revenue growth (not revenue) year over year and Google has a huge head start on AI, computer vision and robotaxis. TSLAs early attempts at computer vision have been waaaay behind. The company is not particularly a major player in AI in general and huge car companies are entering the EV market globally. It’s down 40% in Europe and elons politicalization presents more threats to the tsla brand among its main target customer base than the benefits he may receive through cronyism.  It’s up in Asia, but that’s the place it has the most market potential to lose given how much China incubates and protects its industries. This is a house of cards.

It could have significant growth potential, but this stock is held up by the dumbest people on earth, and when it falls they will all lose a massive amount of wealth. Institutions and non credible media finance fluff pieces make money encouraging retail investors to pump these stocks up and then buying puts or shorts when it inevitably crashes. This is a massive transfer of wealth from retail investors to savvy institutional investors. Anyone still holding tsla are all falling for a pyramid scheme. The higher it goes up, the more money savvy investors will make when it inevitably crashes.

2024-12-17 13:44:16,r/TSLA,Is this not extreme,"Bulls of TSLA can you please share your sentiment about why this valuation is not insane?


The way I see it, at this point even if the stars align and everything goes their way it's still massively over values.

Their robotics is behind the market with no actual leading technology that anybody has seen.

The car market is obviously starting to slump, but everyone has now decided to say ""if you think TSLA is about cars you don't understand TSLA""


For Tesla to be worth what it is NOW it would need widespread robots to exist on a global lecel and be the market leader.


It's market cap is crazy, even when you factor in all the potential future things, it's still nuts.


For TSLA to be worth what people seem to be suggesting it will speculatively be, it'll basically need to be the ONLY FSD/Robotics/taxi company that exists in the world, and by far the best.


TSLA is ALREADY worth more than the combined total of
- every car manufacturer
- every taxi company (IE Uber etc)
- every robotics company (ssymbotic, fanuc etc)

So it's already worth more than all of the fields it's supposedly going to dominate in, so where exactly will this ""realistic speculative value"" come from?


They also have ZERO market in these fields they will supposedly dominate in, and the only one they have a footing in (automotive), they're doing consistently more and more average with competitors consistently catching up to their first into the market advantage.


So whats the reason people should continue to believe in the valuation outside of it being a literal ""real value doesn't matter""

I get that for short term investing, but eventually nearly all companies PE goes to a normal level over a 10 year cycle of growth.


So why should people invest in TSLA long term? It seems like even if everything goes well, it's valuation is still higher than it would be once everything exists with a PE of say 20/30",86,67,Fun_Lingonberry_6244,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1hg9te3/is_this_not_extreme/,1hg9te3

At the moment I've been able to grab 400 shares, at varying points throughout the year.

2024-12-16 07:40:16,r/TSLA,Wedbush Dan Ives raises price target from $400 to $515. Two weeks ago he raised the price target from $300 to $400. ,"Based on the search results, here's an analysis of Dan Ives's performance as an analyst:

Performance Metrics:

1. Success Rate:

* According to TipRanks, Ives has a 54.95% - 55% success rate (272 out of 495 ratings were profitable)
* Another source indicates a 68.72% success rate on 45 stocks
* The discrepancy might be due to different time periods or measurement methodologies

1. Average Return:

* Per rating: +6.60% according to TipRanks
* Another source cites an average return of 26.97%

1. Rating Distribution:

* Heavily skewed toward ""Buy"" ratings (78.61%)
* 20.48% Hold ratings
* Only 0.91% Sell ratings

Strengths:

1. Technology Sector Expertise: He primarily covers technology stocks and has deep expertise in this sector
2. High-Profile Coverage: Covers major tech companies like Apple, Tesla, Microsoft
3. Regular Media Presence: Frequently quoted and interviewed about tech sector trends

Criticisms/Concerns:

1. Price Targets Often Aggressive: His price targets can be significantly higher than current market prices and fundamentals
2. Optimistic Bias: With nearly 79% of ratings being ""Buy,"" there appears to be an optimistic bias
3. Mixed Track Record: While a 55% success rate is above random chance, it's not exceptionally high for a professional analyst

Recent Notable Calls (2024):

* Raised Tesla target to $300 (bull case $400)
* Apple target at $300 (20.9% upside)
* Palantir target raised to $75
* Salesforce target raised to $375

Overall Assessment:  
While Ives has established himself as a prominent voice in technology sector analysis, his price targets often appear to be optimistic and may not always align with fundamental valuations. His analysis seems to place heavy emphasis on future growth potential and technological developments, particularly in AI, which can make his targets appear aggressive compared to traditional valuation metrics.

Investors should consider his insights as part of a broader analysis rather than relying solely on his price targets for investment decisions.",41,10,rookieking11,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1hfd98o/wedbush_dan_ives_raises_price_target_from_400_to/,1hfd98o

Here are ten specific points mentioned in the video:
 * Steven Hendrickson's Fatal Crash: The video details the tragic death of Steven Hendrickson in a Tesla Model 3 on Autopilot, highlighting the impact on his family.
 * Tesla's Reliance on Cameras: The video emphasizes Tesla's primary use of cameras for Autopilot, contrasting it with other manufacturers who utilize a combination of sensors like radar and lidar.
 * Hundreds of Crashes: The video states that Tesla vehicles on Autopilot have been involved in hundreds of crashes across the US since 2016.
 * Elon Musk's Claims: The video quotes Elon Musk's assertion that Autopilot is safer than human driving and will ultimately save millions of lives.
 * Missy Cummings' Warning: The video mentions Missy Cummings, an expert on autonomous driving, who warned about the risks of semi-autonomous vehicles in 2016, stating that fatalities were inevitable.
 * NHTSA Investigations: The video highlights the numerous investigations launched by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) into Autopilot crashes since 2021.
 * Hidden Crash Data: The video reveals that much of the crash data submitted by Tesla to NHTSA is hidden from public view due to its proprietary nature.
 * Common Crash Scenarios: The video identifies specific crash scenarios, such as sudden veering and failure to stop or yield, that are frequently observed in Tesla Autopilot incidents.
 * Limitations of Camera-Based Systems: The video discusses the limitations of camera-based systems, particularly their difficulty in recognizing and reacting to unexpected obstacles like overturned trucks.
 * False Sense of Security: The video emphasizes the potential for drivers to develop a false sense of security in Autopilot, leading to overconfidence and reduced attention.",0,0,rookieking11,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1he7l02/hidden_autopilot_data_reveals_why_teslas_crash_wsj/,1he7l02

2024-12-11 00:07:41,r/stocks,Siemens - worth a look? A balanced view.,"Purpose of this post is to get a sense of 'sentiment' about Siemens. It's not a lazy $hit post, asking ""what do y'all think yo""? But yeah, essentially, that's what I am asking, besides listing down a long list of pros and cons of the company.

I've no position yet (long or short), but thinking of it.

Pros:

1. The conglomerate needs no introduction. There's virtually NO piece of any complex, industrial machinery (boats, planes, turbines, large diesel engines, data center infrastructure, heating, cooling, all kinds of factories, power plant, high voltage transformer...) that doesn't have at least a few critical components made by Siemens. The company stands to benefit from **energy transition, mobility, urbanization** (smart cities), and is focused on **high-margin** specialized components.
2. Valuations: 18 PE, 1.9 PS [Siemens AG - Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/SIE:ETR?window=YTD)
3. News: there's plenty of positive news and developments [Google News ](https://news.google.com/search?for=siemens&amp;hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US:en) Most notably, partnership with NVDA for industrial robotics applications. Won a few contracts in the middle East. 
4. Gaining momentum: for last 10 days at least, the trading volume is virtually all **BUY volume**. BUY volume means the trades were executed at 'ask' price. Buyers had to up their bids to get hands on the stock.
5. Low retail concentration: only 19% retail shareholders. Less susceptible to 'crowd' thinking. It's not your GME or TSLA which will up/down 10% in a day. Movements will be very slow and steady. In other words, low volatality. It's a steady wealth builder with 14% YTD; don't expect 500% in 5 years.

Cons:

1. German company. Yes, yes, we know Germany is in recession, aging population, generally hard business climate.. etc etc. But the company's operations are global. The only geographical 'risk' is, you've a stock in EUR currency, not traded as ADR on US exchange (as far as I know). Revenues come from all over the world, in many currencies.
2. Lot of competition: ABB, GE, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Larsen &amp; Toubro.. may not be retail, well known names, but they all do the same stuff, some better; some worse.

2024-12-10 15:42:37,r/stocks,Google shares rise on new quantum chip breakthrough,"

Shares of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) saw a 4% increase in pre-open trading Tuesday, reflecting investor confidence following the company's unveiling of its new quantum computing chip, Willow. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, introduced the chip on Monday, highlighting its ability to significantly reduce computational errors and its performance in benchmark tests.

Pichai emphasized the chip's potential in practical applications, stating, ""We see Willow as an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications in areas like drug discovery, fusion energy, battery design + more.""

The new chip, according to Pichai, has achieved two major milestones. It can exponentially decrease errors with the addition of more qubits, addressing a quantum error correction challenge that has persisted for nearly three decades. In addition, Willow completed a standard benchmark computation in less than five minutes, a task that would take one of the fastest supercomputers today more than 10 septillion years.
This development is part of Google's long-term commitment to quantum computing, a vision that began over a decade ago when Pichai founded Google Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) AI in 2012. 

The goal is to build a quantum computer that leverages quantum mechanics to advance scientific discovery and address societal challenges.

The announcement drew a simple yet telling reaction from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who expressed his astonishment with a single word, ""wow,"" on social media platform X.

The Willow chip represents a significant advancement for Google Quantum AI and positions the company closer to achieving commercially viable quantum computing applications.",542,43,Guy_PCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hb39my/google_shares_rise_on_new_quantum_chip/,1hb39my

2024-12-06 11:12:00,r/TSLA,Tesla's Self-Driving Narrative Is Falling Apart?,"**Tesla's** promise to lead the full self-driving (“FSD”) revolution has increasingly been the focal point of Tesla bulls. In fact, CEO Elon Musk has even stated that Tesla's stock is near worthless if the company is unable to achieve its self-driving ambitions. With FSD being pitched as the cornerstone of the automotive future, Tesla has positioned itself as more than just a car company's tech titan poised to disrupt transportation and reap unprecedented profits from full self-driving.

However, beneath this grand narrative relentlessly pitched by Elon Musk and Tesla bulls like fund manager Cathie Wood, a far more uncertain reality lay. Despite Tesla's head start and tens of billions of dollars invested into FSD, the company remains far from delivering safe Level 5 or even Level 4 autonomy. Meanwhile, competitors like Waymo are leaping ahead, deploying driverless robotaxis exponentially and rapidly refining their systems with real-world data.

Much of Tesla's valuation hinges on the belief that its FSD technology will revolutionize transportation and unlock massive revenue streams, most of which will be directed toward Tesla. In the increasingly likely scenario that Tesla cannot deliver on this promise, and Waymo continues to solidify its rapidly growing lead, the very foundation of Tesla's bull thesis risks crumbling along with the company's high valuation. **Tesla's** promise to lead the full self-driving (“FSD”) revolution has increasingly been the focal point of Tesla bulls.

Labeling Tesla as a ""technology company"" is misleading - it’s a car manufacturer that often misguides investors, with a CEO whose compensation dwarfs the company's actual profitability.

It's also worth noting that a significant portion of Tesla's past profits has come from government largesse in the form of tax credits. With global competition heating up, Tesla seems ill-prepared. I’ve driven vehicles from BYD and NIO, and their range, comfort, and innovation significantly outshine Tesla's offerings.

Elon Musk should focus on creating sector-defining products rather than relying on nationalism and financial crutches - it’s a strategy with a limited shelf life.

2024-12-02 21:31:08,r/TSLA,Tesla stock is extremely overvalued in my opinion.,"
I’m not an experienced investor by any means, but I just really cannot see why Tesla stock is valued at what it currently is. I would love for someone to change my mind.

So here’s why I think Tesla is overvalued:

So around the time trump got elected, Tesla stock soared from around 210 to around 360. That’s around 70%. And I believe that is purely from hype of elons association with trump. 
So that’s all well and good, but if we look at earnings, they are pretty stagnant with the last year not making progress beyond 25B total revenue, and net income is not making significant leaps and bounds, definitely not enough to keep up with a 70% increase in price. Also if we look at PE ratio; its sitting at a staggering 95

My prediction is that come the next earrings report, we will have a similar one to the last 4, defiantly not anywhere close to the price increase we have seen. Trump, the main driver of this price increase is sworn in 9 days before the Q4 earnings report. This is not enough time to affect teslas earnings in any way, and we will see a substantial drop in price. 

I would love to know other peoples thoughts on this 🙂",434,234,SadLeather6361,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1h54xej/tesla_stock_is_extremely_overvalued_in_my_opinion/,1h54xej

I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts.

I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, not the business, long-term prospects, or the people involved.

PLEASE ask specific questions and PLEASE don’t ask about earnings because I typically don’t take positions before earnings announcements. Questions like “Thoughts on \_\_\_\_\_?” or “Why isn’t \_\_\_ on the watchlist?” or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion.

TSLA +5% overnight due to this news.

  
(Bloomberg) -- Members of President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team have told advisers they plan to make a federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles one of the Transportation Department’s priorities, according to people familiar with the matter.

If new rules enable cars without human controls, that would directly benefit Elon Musk, the Tesla Inc. chief executive officer and Trump mega-donor who has become a powerful fixture in the president-elect’s inner circle. He has bet the future of the EV maker on self-driving technology and artificial intelligence.

Current federal rules pose significant roadblocks for companies looking to deploy vehicles without steering wheels or foot pedals in large quantities, which Tesla plans to do. The Trump team is looking for policy leaders for the department to develop a framework to regulate self-driving vehicles, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.

While the Transportation Department, through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, can issue rules that would make it easier to run autonomous vehicles, an act of Congress would clear the way for mass adoption of self-driving cars. A bipartisan legislative measure being discussed in early stages would create federal rules around AVs, two of the people said.

One candidate under consideration for Transportation secretary is Emil Michael, a former Uber Technologies Inc. executive who has spoken with Trump’s team and potential staffers, they said. The work is in its early stages and policy details have yet to be determined, they said. 

Republican Representatives Sam Graves of Missouri and Garret Graves of Louisiana have also been considered to lead the department, the people said.

The transition team didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Musk in October announced plans to produce large numbers of driverless Tesla robotaxis that lack driver controls starting in 2026. Current US regulations pose significant hurdles to Musk’s plans for the so-called Cybercab, including a cap limiting their deployment. 

He supported federal rules for autonomy on Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call, saying he’d use any role with the government to push for a process to allow autonomous vehicles to be used nationwide. The pronouncement prompted a selloff of shares of Uber and rival Lyft Inc.

Trump has since named Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative to “dismantle government bureaucracy” and slash spending and regulations deemed overly burdensome.

Past efforts to come up with federal legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles have stumbled.

NHTSA currently permits manufacturers to deploy 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under a granted exemption, but legislative efforts to increase that number to as many as 100,000 have repeatedly failed.

A bill to do that sailed through the House several years ago during Trump’s first term, but the measure has been bogged down in the Senate. An attempt during the first year of the Biden administration to merge the bill with other legislation faltered when some manufacturers tried to include language that would prevent consumers from suing or forming class-action cases.",372,89,obliviousredditor3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gtwjvx/trump_team_is_seeking_to_ease_us_rules_for/,1gtwjvx

2024-11-15 16:03:56,r/TSLA,(Urgent Update news for acquirement of NVDA chips) Why xAI and Tesla(TSLA) are poised to dominate the AI Era,"*xAI and Tesla*, these two giants with intertwined destinies that are set to redefine the AI landscape. Now that, xAI’s recent announcement to deploy **100,000 NVIDIA GPUs** in its Memphis data center isn’t just a tech upgrade—it’s a game changer.

**xAI’s 100,000 NVIDIA GPUs** will generate over **1 exaflop** of AI computational power.  
(Compare this to OpenAI’s estimated **10,000-20,000 GPUs** supporting their GPT models, or Google’s TPU v4 pods operating at a fraction of this scale.)  
Any correction will be graceful..!

This scale allows xAI to train AI models faster, handle more real-time data, and optimize complex systems like Tesla’s autonomous driving network.

# Tesla’s Data Advantage

Tesla already has over **4 billion miles** of real-world driving data, dwarfing competitors like Waymo (\~20 million miles). With xAI’s enhanced computing capabilities, this data can be leveraged at unprecedented speeds to perfect Full Self-Driving (FSD).

FSD is a $100 billion market opportunity by 2030, and Tesla’s ability to iterate on its AI models faster than anyone else ensures they’ll maintain their leadership position.

# AI Independence &amp; Scalability

Here’s the kicker: xAI’s infrastructure makes them *self-reliant*. Unlike OpenAI or Google, which lean heavily on external cloud providers (Azure, GCP), xAI’s proprietary setup minimizes external dependencies, cuts costs, and increases efficiency.

In fact, the estimated cost to train GPT-4 was around **$100 million**. With xAI’s setup, similar feats could be achieved at **half the cost** or less, thanks to optimized hardware and data pipelines.

# With Tesla’s real-world data and xAI’s unmatched computational power, I guess they are set to lead the next wave of AI innovation. While others are playing catch-up, Tesla and xAI are securing their place as the strongest players in the AI-driven future.

2024-11-10 08:08:56,r/TSLA,Could Tesla's Sky-High valation really be justified?,"Tesla's stock price recently soared past $320, largely driven by optimism over Elon Musk's political influence and speculation that a Trump administration could favor his companies. The market seems convinced that regulatory rollbacks on self-driving tech and robotaxis are on the horizon, fueling the rally.

But as a Tesla shareholder, I’m growing increasingly concerned. Tesla’s forward P/E ratio is a jaw-dropping 102x. To put that into perspective, Nvidia’s is 39x, and even industry giants like Microsoft and Amazon sit well below Tesla with P/E ratios under 50. Essentially, Tesla's current valuation is pricing in over a century’s worth of future profits today. Let that sink in—**it would take 100 years or more for Tesla to earn enough profit to justify its current price, assuming everything goes perfectly.**

This isn’t just a lofty bet; it’s practically unprecedented. Companies with such extreme valuations historically face immense pressure to not only meet but consistently exceed market expectations. One slip, whether it’s slower-than-expected growth, regulatory pushback, or a major PR crisis, and the stock could come crashing down.

And speaking of risks, let’s talk about the robotaxi business. This isn’t like selling software or electric cars. We're talking about a technology that directly impacts human lives. Fatalities linked to self-driving systems already make headlines, and with robotaxis, the stakes are even higher. If another tragic incident occurs, who shoulders the blame? Will Tesla or its consumers be held accountable in court? The legal and ethical minefield is massive, and the market may be underestimating these risks.

I want Tesla to thrive, but I can’t ignore the glaring disconnect between its valuation and the immense challenges ahead. Am I the only one feeling uneasy about this? What are your thoughts?

Also there is a challenges for Tesla's FSD adoption is SK's urban landscape and furthermore for some countries.

Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature, a cornerstone of its technological ambitions, faces significant hurdles in gaining traction in South Korea, particularly in metropolitan areas like Seoul. While FSD is designed to handle complex driving environments, the unique challenges of South Korean cities could limit its effectiveness and appeal.

One major obstacle is Seoul's aggressive push to reduce car usage. Policies like the vehicle rotation system, which restricts car use on certain days based on license plate numbers, encourage residents to minimize their reliance on personal vehicles. This creates a challenging environment for a technology that thrives on consistent, everyday driving to improve its algorithms and reliability.

Additionally, the streets of Seoul are filled with unpredictable factors that complicate autonomous driving. Bicycles and electric scooters are increasingly popular, sharing road space with cars. These smaller, often faster-moving vehicles frequently appear suddenly in traffic, posing a significant challenge for both human drivers and autonomous systems. Even with advanced sensors and algorithms, the split-second decision-making required in such scenarios pushes FSD to its limits.

These factors make South Korea a uniquely difficult market for FSD adoption. Unlike in countries with more predictable traffic patterns or widespread suburban sprawl, the dense, dynamic, and highly regulated urban landscape in South Korea poses a serious challenge to Tesla’s self-driving ambitions.

2024-11-06 19:05:20,r/TSLA,Why #Tesla Shares Surge Following Trump's Victory $tsla,"
AI Analyst:

Key Insight: The anticipation of favorable policy shifts, particularly the acceleration of FSD technology approval, is a critical driver of Tesla's stock performance following Trump's victory.

•#ElonMusk's Support for Trump: Tesla's stock saw a notable rise following Donald Trump's electoral victory, partly due to Tesla CEO Elon Musk's endorsement and financial backing, contributing $132 million to the Trump campaign. This relationship suggests a potential for favorable business conditions for Tesla.

Potential Policy Benefits:
Investors are optimistic that Trump’s potential economic policies could favor Tesla. 
These include:
•Tax and Regulation: Expectations of lower tax rates and reduced regulatory burdens.
•Tariffs on Chinese Imports: Possible higher tariffs could hinder Chinese electric vehicle competitors like BYD and Nio, thereby enhancing Tesla's market position.

•Market Expectations:
•Tesla's substantial presence in the electric vehicle market means it could benefit from changes in EV tax incentives under the Trump administration.
•Analysts emphasize the potential acceleration of full self-driving (FSD) technology approvals under Trump's presidency, which could significantly increase Tesla’s market value.

•Market Reaction:
•Tesla shares surged over 12% in premarket trading, reaching a new 52-week high.
•As a result, Elon Musk's net worth increased by $15 billion. #SmartNews

2024-10-23 22:16:25,r/stocks,Tesla shares jump 6% on profit beat,"* Tesla reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped analysts’ estimates even as revenue came in just shy of expectations.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $25.18 billion vs. $25.37 billion expected

Revenue increased 8% in the quarter from $23.35 billion a year earlier. Net income rose to about $2.17 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $1.85 billion, or 53 cents s share, a year ago.

Tesla’s profit margins were bolstered by $739 million in automotive regulatory credit revenue during the quarter. The company has also been offering an array of discounts and incentives to spur sales.

Automotive revenue increased 2% to $20 billion from $19.63 billion in the same period a year earlier. Energy generation and storage revenue soared 52% to $2.38 billion, while services and other revenue jumped 29% to $2.79 billion.

Operating margin was reported at 10.8% of sales to improve from last quarter's mark of 6.3%, and top last year's mark of 7.6%. Total GAAP gross margin was 19.8% vs. 17.9% a year ago and 18.0% in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.67 billion vs. $3.76 billion a year ago. For the quarter, the EV juggernaut's adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 18.5% of sales from 16.1% a year ago.

# 

Tesla had already disclosed 462,890 deliveries for Q3. The electric vehicle maker said it produced 469,796 vehicles during the quarter. Tesla noted that 3% of the deliveries were subject to operating lease accounting. For reference, Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles in Q2 of this year and 435,059 vehicles in Q3 of last year. Tesla's  all-time deliveries record was 484,507 vehicles in Q4 of 2023. Looking ahead, Tesla reiterated that plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025.

# More than just EVs

Tesla said energy storage deployments decreased sequentially in Q3 to a record 6.9 GWh, but were up 75% Y/Y. Overall, Tesla said energy services and other businesses are becoming increasingly profitable parts of the company. ""As energy storage products continue to ramp, and our vehicle fleet continues to grow, we are expecting continued profit growth from these businesses over time,"" noted TSLA. The company also said that it deployed and is training ahead of schedule on a 29k H100 cluster at Gigafactory Texas, where it expects to have 50k H100 capacity by the end of October.

# Balance sheet

Tesla ended the quarter with a cash position of $33.6 billion. The sequential increase of $2.9 billion was a result of positive free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Operating cash flow was $6.3 billion during the quarter.

**SUMMARY**

We delivered strong results in Q3 with growth in vehicle deliveries both sequentially and year-on-year, resulting in record third-quarter volumes. We also recognized our second-highest quarter of regulatory credit revenues as other OEMs are still behind on meeting emissions requirements.

Our cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle came down to its lowest level ever at \~$35,100. In order to continue accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy, we need to make EVs affordable for everyone, including making total cost of ownership per mile competitive with all forms of transportation. Preparations remain underway for our offering of new vehicles – including more affordable models – which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025. At our ""We, Robot"" event on October 10, we detailed our long-term goal of offering autonomous transport with a cost per mile below rideshare, personal car ownership, and even public transit.

The Energy business achieved another strong quarter with a record gross margin. Additionally, the Megafactory in Lathrop produced 200 Megapacks in a week, and Powerwall deployments reached a record for the second quarter in a row as we continue to ramp Powerwall 3.

Despite sustained macroeconomic headwinds and others pulling back on EV investments, we remain focused on expanding our vehicle and energy product lineup, reducing costs and making critical investments in AI projects and production capacity. We believe these efforts will allow us to capitalize on the ongoing transition in the transportation and energy sectors.",587,246,thelastsubject123,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gak7c4/tesla_shares_jump_6_on_profit_beat/,1gak7c4
2024-10-23 14:35:32,r/stocks,Alphabet To $7 Trillion By 2025?,"We believe Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) is positioned to grow its valuation by well over 3x from the already huge $2-trillion figure now – potentially becoming the world’s most valuable company by a huge margin – as its often-overlooked Waymo autonomous driving business quietly revolutionizes the transportation sector. This would take the stock to over $500 a share. Here’s why.

Fact: Waymo has grown the number of weekly paid rides from 10,000 to over 100,000 in the last 12 months. It went from 50,000 weekly rides to 100,000 just in the last six months.

The growth is compelling and the addressable market is massive

Case in point: Uber does more than 200 million rides each week. Let’s let that sink in. So if autonomous rides can capture even half that market, that would mean 100 million rides per week. That’s about 1,000 times where Waymo is today. 200 million rides a week translates to about a billion a month and over 10 billion a year. At $30 per ride, we’re talking revenues of close to $300 billion per year.

But wait… there is more to the growth story

If Waymo is already delivering over 100,000 driverless rides, how many more people might switch from driving their cars to being driven by autonomous vehicles? The shift could be massive. For each person hailing a cab, there are at least 10 others driving their own cars. Many of these drivers might reconsider once they see millions of people relaxing in the back seat, streaming Netflix, while they’re stuck behind the wheel.

In fact, early data backs this up. According to Earnest Analytics, Waymo is already retaining riders at a higher rate compared to other ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft. People enjoy the experience of autonomous vehicles. Safety could also be another attraction. Waymo published a report last year indicating that its autonomous vehicles achieved an 85% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to national rates for human-operated cars.

Investors will soon recognize that the $300 billion revenue figure for the current ride-hailing market has substantial growth potential – it could easily expand by 2-3x. A $1 trillion market for autonomous rides isn’t out of the question. This growth would also translate to significant revenue opportunities for automakers like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which are working on their driverless vehicle technologies.

But wait aren’t so many automakers and tech players working on autonomous driving?

Yes, but not all of them are making the same progress. Waymo has a head start in the market. Its main competitor, General Motor’s backed Cruise lost its driverless permits in California after a serious accident, making Waymo the only publicly available robotaxi service in San Francisco. Uber exited its self-driving taxi program about six years ago and has partnered with Waymo to bring its services to the Uber app in some cities. While electric vehicle behemoth Tesla is seen as a leader of sorts in the self-driving space, given its large base of vehicles, it is only slowly getting into the space after the unveiling of its Robotaxi vehicle earlier this month.

Waymo has some advantages in terms of tech as well. It uses a fleet equipped with high-resolution cameras, LiDAR, and radar systems, creating a comprehensive view of its surroundings. And don’t forget Google’s got a secret weapon. It crowdsources annotated data such as CAPTCHA codes from its massive user base, using that to train its machine-learning models. That’s a big advantage in terms of understanding complex driving environments.

The best part?

These are self-driving cars – no human drivers, no unions, no employee or contractor issues, and no human cost. While there will be other expenses, such as software development and battery costs, the absence of driver wages could lead to exceptionally high margins. Margins of 50% aren’t unrealistic when you consider that driver earnings account for a substantial portion of gross fares in traditional ride-hailing models.

If Waymo can capture about one-third of the $1 trillion autonomous rides market, it could generate annual revenues of around $300 billion. With a 50% margin, that’s a neat $150 billion in profits. What’s that worth? At a 30x earnings multiple, that would imply an additional valuation of about $4.5 trillion for Alphabet. Considering that Alphabet is worth roughly $2 trillion presently, this could take the company’s market cap to over $6.5 trillion, or over $500 per share.

To be sure, building this sort of scale can take a good deal of time – quite different from signing up for say a Google or Netflix account. However, investors will need to look well out into the future. Think 2030 (not 2025), maybe even more. The point is not to get stuck – if you’re concerned, look even further out, say 2035! The bottom line: Alphabet is growing Waymo quickly, has the technology and competitive edge, and is addressing a potentially massive market, making this high valuation within reach.

2024-10-12 17:03:00,r/stocks,"Ride-sharing giants Uber, Lyft jump after Tesla’s ‘toothless taxi’ fails to excite investors","Tesla’s hyped robotaxi unveiling posed a threat to Uber’s ride-sharing aspirations, but it has turned into a boon for the stock instead.

Uber shares had been falling on the initial investor excitement leading up to Thursday’s event — particularly slumping in early August and mid-September — but surged more than 9% on Friday on renewed enthusiasm that the company is well positioned to advance its autonomous vehicle offerings. The move pushed the stock to a 52-week high and it was leading the S&amp;P 500 higher during the session.

That is a massive turnaround for Uber’s stock, which is now up nearly 22% over the past month and about 38% for the year. Lyft, another major player, is also surging about 10% on Friday. By comparison, Tesla’s shares are plunging during Friday’s trading session and are down more than 11% this year, vastly underperforming both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq, which have each gained around 22% so far this year.

The buzz around Tesla’s highly anticipated cybercab has largely dissipated due to a lack of detail on its latest full self-driving technology advancements and the company’s failure to provide insight on its ride-sharing service strategy or economics, among other expectations investors had.

“TSLA’s toothless taxi is a best-case outcome for UBER,” Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni said in a Friday note, noting that the electric car maker provided ambitious targets but little signs of feasibility.

Tesla shares drop 6% in premarket after Cybercab robotaxi reveal fails to impress","Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla tumbled Friday after the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event — where CEO Elon Musk unveiled the firm’s Cybercab self-driving concept car — failed to impress investors.

Tesla stock was down 5.8% as of 6:33 a.m. ET in premarket trading on Friday.

Musk revealed Tesla’s Cybercab concept vehicle — a low, silver two-seater, has no steering wheels or pedals — on Thursday night. The plan is for the car to be capable of driving itself autonomously when it launches.

The Tesla boss said the company hopes to be producing the Cybercab before 2027, but offered no details on where the cars will be manufactured. He said consumers would be able to buy a Tesla Cybercab for a price tag under $30,000.

He also said he expects Tesla to have “unsupervised FSD” up and running in Texas and California next year in the company’s Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles. FSD, which stands for Full Self-Driving, is Tesla’s premium driver assistance system, available today in a “supervised” version for Tesla electric vehicles.

The technology still requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

In reaction to the Thursday event, analysts at Barclays said that the revelations had failed to highlight any near-term opportunities for Tesla, instead prioritizing Musk’s vision for a fully autonomous driving future.

“As expected, like prior Tesla product unveils, the event was light on the details, and instead emphasized the vision underpinning Tesla’s growth endeavors in AI/AV \[autonomous vehicles\],” Barclays’ U.S. autos &amp; mobility team wrote in the note early on Friday.

“Yet there were no updates indicating near-term opportunities. Tesla didn’t show its low-cost model planned for 1H′25 production,” they added. “We also didn’t get any near-term updates on FSD progress, or data reflecting improvement in the system.”

Piper Sandler analysts said in a separate Friday note that “most trading-oriented firms will be underwhelmed by the robo-taxi unveiling.”

“We wouldn’t be surprised if the stock sells off in the coming weeks, as pre-event momentum fizzles,” the investment bank’s analysts said in the note.

Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, suggested that Musk failed to make the case that Tesla is an AI company during the event. The bank’s analysts noted that Musk didn’t mention any details on improvements to Tesla’s FSD system, nor did the billionaire go into detail regarding rumored plans of a tie-up between Tesla and xAI, Musk’s AI company. Musk has previously denied such reports.

The event “overall disappointed expectations on a number of areas: a lack of data regarding rate-of-change on FSD/tech, ride-share economics and go-to-market strategy,” Morgan Stanley’s analysts wrote in a note Friday.

“We were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation. As such, we anticipate TSLA to be under pressure following the event,” they added.

It is expected to take some years still before self-driving cars become a mainstream reality on public roads, with regulators concerned over the safety features embedded into such vehicles.

Among the few companies that have successfully launched self-driving cars on public roads is Google’s Waymo, which has offered its robotaxi service to the general public since June.",1970,275,thelastsubject123,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g18fon/tesla_shares_drop_6_in_premarket_after_cybercab/,1g18fon

2024-10-10 17:05:31,r/TSLA,NotebookLM on Tonight's Robotaxi Event,"I added a lot of data, articles, research and videos to a NotebookLM and asked for a memo on tonight's Robotaxi event. Here's a summary and podcast you can listen to. 

# TSLA Robotaxi Event Preview

Tesla's Robotaxi event is scheduled for tonight, October 10th. Options market data suggests investors are expecting a significant stock price move following the event, with a potential 9% swing priced in. Here's a preview of what to expect:

**Potential Positive Catalysts for TSLA Stock:**

* **Concrete Launch Dates:** Announcing firm launch dates for robotaxi services in specific markets, particularly major cities, would signal tangible progress and boost investor confidence.
* **Impressive FSD Demo:** A live, compelling demonstration of Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) capabilities in challenging urban environments could showcase the technology's maturity and commercial viability.
* **Lucid Business Model:** Clearly articulating a profitable and scalable business model for the robotaxi service, including pricing strategies, fleet management, and potential partnerships, would address investor concerns about the venture's long-term sustainability.
* **International Regulatory Wins:** News of regulatory approvals secured in key markets like Europe and China would validate Tesla's technology and unlock significant growth opportunities.
* **Multiple Robotaxi Prototypes:** As hinted at in the event invite, Tesla might unveil multiple robotaxi prototypes, potentially including a compact car, a high-density van, and a sedan, expanding potential use cases and market appeal.

**Potential Negative Catalysts for TSLA Stock:**

* **Vague Timelines:** A lack of specific launch dates or a reliance on vague timelines, particularly regarding regulatory approvals or technology milestones, could disappoint investors seeking concrete progress.
* **Underwhelming FSD Performance:** Any hiccups or limitations in the FSD demonstration, especially concerning safety or the ability to handle complex urban scenarios, could raise doubts about the technology's readiness for prime time.
* **Unclear Business Case:** Failing to present a detailed and compelling business model, including revenue projections, cost structures, and profitability targets, could leave investors unconvinced about the robotaxi program's financial viability.
* **Regulatory Roadblocks:** Any indication of significant regulatory hurdles or pushback, particularly in major markets, would signal potential delays and challenges in deploying robotaxis at scale.

**Past Tesla Event Stock Reactions:**

Analyzing past Tesla events reveals a mixed bag of stock price outcomes, highlighting the importance of managing expectations and focusing on concrete deliverables.

* **Tesla Autonomy Day (April 22, 2019):** While Tesla unveiled its FSD computer and a vision for a robotaxi network, the stock price dipped slightly (-0.63%), potentially due to a lack of specific timelines or go-to-market details.
* **Tesla Battery Day (September 22, 2020):** Initially met with some skepticism, the event ultimately led to a stock price decline (-5.6%). Despite ambitious long-term goals and technological advancements, investors seemed concerned about the lack of immediate impact and potential funding requirements.
* **Tesla Investor Day (March 1, 2023):** Despite sharing a compelling long-term vision and highlighting operational efficiencies, the stock experienced a significant drop (-14.81%), possibly reflecting a disconnect between the company's ambitions and near-term market realities.
* **Cybertruck Unveiling (November 21, 2019):** The unveiling of the Cybertruck generated substantial buzz and pre-orders, demonstrating Tesla's ability to disrupt new markets. While the initial market reaction was mixed, the stock ultimately recovered, highlighting the importance of long-term vision and execution.

The upcoming Robotaxi event offers Tesla a crucial opportunity to address investor concerns and demonstrate tangible progress in its autonomous driving ambitions. A focus on concrete timelines, a compelling business model, and evidence of regulatory support will be paramount in driving positive stock momentum.

TSLA does have an advantage of ai + their cameras + tons of real world auto driving data, but they lack lidar.

Could it be that Tesla's version of robotaxi will use something like tech from AUR, MBLY, LAZR?

2024-10-02 15:10:06,r/stocks,"Tesla stock slips after it reports 462,890 total deliveries during the third quarter","Tesla posted its third-quarter vehicle production and deliveries report on Wednesday. The stock fell about 2% in premarket trading after the report.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q3 2024: 462,890

Total production Q3 2024: 469,796

Analysts were expecting deliveries of 463,310 in the period ending Sept. 30, according to estimates compiled by FactSet StreetAccount.

Deliveries are not defined in Tesla’s financial disclosures, but are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company. It’s one of the most closely-watched metrics on Wall Street.

In the year-ago period, Tesla reported 435,059 deliveries and production of 430,488 EVs. Last quarter, the company reported 443,956 deliveries, and production of 410,831 vehicles.

Tesla is facing increased competitive pressure, especially in China, from companies like BYD and Geely, along with a new generation of automakers, including Li Auto and Nio.

In the U.S., EV competitors like Rivian are maturing, while legacy automakers Ford and General Motors are selling more electric vehicles after walking back more ambitious goals for electrification.

GM this week reported a roughly 60% increase in EV sales for the third quarter from a year earlier. Still, its electric business is tiny compared to Tesla’s, with just 32,100 units sold in the latest period, accounting for 4.9% of the company’s total sales.

Ford plans to report results on Wednesday.

Tesla hasn’t issued specific guidance for 2024 deliveries, but executives have said they expect a lower delivery growth rate this year versus last despite the company having added a new vehicle, the angular stainless steel Cybertruck, to their lineup.

The company also said on Wednesday that it deployed 6.9 GWh of energy storage products in the quarter.

Shares of Tesla climbed 32% in the third quarter, erasing their loss for the year in the process. The stock is now up almost 4% in 2024, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 19%.

Tesla’s brand has been under pressure in the U.S. due in part to the antics of CEO Elon Musk, who, in addition to endorsing former President Donald Trump, has shared what the White House called “racist hate,” and false claims about immigrants and election fraud on X, his social media app.

But Tesla still sells more battery electric vehicles in the U.S. than any other automaker, with Hyundai a distant second.

In its third-quarter earnings report later this month, investors will be particularly focused on profit margins.

Tesla has continued to offer attractive financing options and an array of incentives to drive sales volume in recent months in China as well as in the U.S. Prior to earnings, Tesla will host a marketing event on Oct. 10, and is expected to show off the design of “dedicated robotaxi.”

Musk has promised Tesla self-driving cars for years, but the company has yet to deliver. Meanwhile competitors like Waymo and Pony.ai have begun operating commercial robotaxi services.

2024-10-02 04:20:32,r/TSLA,Genuine question about market valuation,"I'd like to preface this by saying I am not rooting for tesla's stock to go up or down or anything. I've actually made a little bit of profit in my ""messing around money"" by anticipating that the stock would go up leading into the robotaxi event. I've pulled out of that position and am currently not invested in tesla at all other than whatever comprises my index funds.

  
Conventional wisdom says that a company is generally worth about 15 times its yearly profit. There's an **obvious** exception to that rule of thumb when you consider a company with a steep trajectory, be it up or down. While Tesla's current trajectory is currently downward, there are certainly reasons to believe its future trajectory may have some upward momentum depending on its robotaxi/energy developments. 

  
My question is, for those who are investing in Tesla, have any of you actually looked at projections of those best case scenarios for their robotaxi/energy sector profits and feel convinced that their net profits (accounting for steep cost of development!) will approach 4 or 5 times their current profits in the next 3-5 years? I personally struggle to see where they would get such a high revenue stream, as even if robotaxi works super well, which it might, the cost saved by just the drivers' employment hours doesn't seem to drive up the profit margin of uber-like taxi services to the levels Tesla would need to get its current market valuation.

2024-10-01 17:23:05,r/stocks,The Crash of the stock market has arrived. Price/Earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire S&amp;P 500. ,"Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. 

The ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.

According to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&amp;P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.

Below is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&amp;P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..

|Year|GSPC Price|6.5 year return on investment|
|:-|:-|:-|
||
|1933.5|10.91||
|1940|12.05|10.44%|
|1946.5|18.43|52.95%|
|1953|26.38|43.13%|
|1959.5|58.68|122%|
|1966|92.88|58%|
|1972.5|107.14|15%|
|1979|99.93|-7.22%|

|2011.5|1320.64|11.70%|
|2018|2471.65|87.10%|
|2024.5|5525.29|123%|

While the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.

Historically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&amp;P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.

Currently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.

In the history of the S&amp;P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...

* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).
* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).
* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).

Images aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07

Historically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.

* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&amp;P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.
* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&amp;P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.
* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).

**Okay -- so** ***Maybe*** **we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**

Outside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.

* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.
* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.
* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.
* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.
* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.
* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.
* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.
* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).
* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.
* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.
* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.
* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.
* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.
* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.
* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.

I believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.

**This economic downturn may be severe.**

In the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.

**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**

People have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.

This will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.

**What happens from here?**

I don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I'm probably wrong about 100% of this.

The prediction in bold below is what I posted 90 days ago. I now believe the top is officially in -- that we won't see another ATH for a long time. 

**My Prediction? GSPC/SPY cruise up a tiny bit further, to +/- $5900/$590 -- before retreating to $3500/$350 by 12/2025.**

2024-09-27 12:04:39,r/stocks,'Safety Disaster:' Tesla FSD 'Galaxies Away From Being Anywhere Close To Competition',"* Tesla's FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised, is now the core technology behind the robotaxi service the company plans to launch.
* Most analysts assign hefty value for the FSD technology alone.

  
With just two weeks to go for Tesla, Inc.’s TSLA Robotaxi unveil event, an analyst painted a bleak picture of the company’s self-driving technology.



**What Happened**: Tesla’s FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised FSD, is a “safety disaster” and “galaxies away from being anywhere close to the competition,” said GLJ Research’s Gordon Johnson in a note. Tesla’s competitors in this arena are Alphabet, Inc.’s GOOGL GOOG Waymo and General Motors Corp.’s GM Cruise.



With Tesla eyeing the rollout of its Fully Supervised FSD in China, the Elon Musk-led company would be up against domestic player Baidu, Inc.’s BIDU Apollo Go.



Johnson referenced reviews by two sources to make his case. Independent lab AMCI Testing, which tried the technology, said the overall performance of Tesla’s camera-enabled autonomous-driving software is “suspect.” In a report released on Tuesday, the firm said its evaluation showed how often human intervention was required for safe operation. “In fact, our drivers had to intervene over 75 times during the evaluation; an average of once every 13 miles,” it said.



While the FSD 12.5.1 was impressive, it is incredibly dangerous for drivers operating with FSD to drive with their hands in their laps or away from the steering wheels, it said. “The most critical moments of FSD miscalculation are split-second events that even professional drivers, operating with a test mindset, must focus on catching,” it added.



Johnson also referred to data from [Teslafsdtracker.com](http://Teslafsdtracker.com), which aggregates TSLA FSD driving experiences/data, in real-time from users, which shows that the latest iteration of FSD has a **critical disengagement every 130 miles and every 72 miles when driven in a city.**

  
Data reported by competitors to the California Department of Motor Vehicles show that miles to disengagement data for various players are as follows:

* Waymo: 17,311 miles
* **Amazon, Inc.’s** AMZN Zoox: 177,602 miles
* [Pony.Ai](http://Pony.Ai) (startup): 17,077 miles
* WeRide (startup): 21,191 miles

The **metric for Tesla is 13 miles**, based on AMCI’s statistics, Johnson said, although Tesla doesn’t yet report data to California DMV, given its FSD tech is **only Level 2.**  


**Why It’s Important:** Johnson noted that many sell-side analysts assign a valuation of $300 billion to $600 billion for Tesla’s FSD technology. In real-time, the value is close to zero, he said, adding that it could be negative, given the “liability of putting something this dangerous on roads.”

  
According to Ark’s valuation model, by 2029, robotaxis, which has FSD as its core technology, would account for 63% of Tesla’s revenue and 86% of EBITDA.

Future Fund LLC Managing Partner Gary Black, a Tesla bull, said in a recent post on X that Tesla's FSD is not yet close to the 99.99% efficacy needed for unsupervised autonomy.



In premarket trading on Thursday, Tesla rose 2.05% to $262.30

I’d love to hear your thoughts on this. I do think PYPL has $100-$120 in it but I’d like to hold on to my gains.

Tesla Slips to 8th on WSB Despite AI Breakthrough and Record Sales in China","Tesla, currently ranked 8th on the latest WSB list, saw a drop of three positions compared to the previous day. Recent performance of Tesla (TSLA) shows a 0.87% increase, marking a three-day winning streak with an accumulated rise of 8.26% over the last three days.

During the recent All-In Summit 2024, Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed the company's latest blueprint in AI technology. He announced that Tesla's next-generation AI training chip, Dojo 2, is expected to be mass-produced by the end of 2025. This underscores Tesla's ongoing commitment and strength in the fields of autonomous driving and AI technology.

Musk emphasized that Tesla's AI ecosystem is built around two core components: Dojo for high-performance model training, while in-vehicle chips focus on real-time model inference. He disclosed that multiple generations of Dojo chips have been planned, aiming to continuously enhance AI computational efficiency and power. The upcoming Dojo 2, reportedly capable of rivaling Nvidia's high-end B200 AI training system, is expected to further solidify Tesla's leadership in autonomous driving technology.

At the 2024 China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS) held in Beijing on September 12, Tesla showcased its theme ""One Purchase, Continuous Evolution"". The exhibition highlighted Tesla’s intelligent driving solutions and value-leading products and services.

The lineup featured the second-generation humanoid robot integrating cutting-edge AI technology, machine vision, and precision mechanical design. Tesla also showcased futuristic designs, industry-leading exoskeleton architecture, and robust performance of Cybertrucks, offering a visual feast that turned sci-fi into reality. Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) chip further confirmed its superior road safety features.

August data from the China Passenger Car Association showed Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory delivered 86,697 vehicles, marking a 17% month-over-month increase, setting a new domestic sales record for this year with a 37% increase. Model Y remained the domestic passenger car market sales champion with 56,000 deliveries, while Model 3 led the luxury sedan segment with over 30,000 units delivered.

Tesla has constructed over 55,000 Supercharger stalls worldwide, with more than 11,500 Supercharger stalls and over 2,400 destination charging piles in China, covering all provinces and municipalities. The 2023 Impact Report highlighted that Tesla's global Supercharger network achieved an average uptime of 99.97%. Tesla's strategy of OTA software upgrades ensures continuous enhancement of in-car features, allowing owners to unlock new functionalities and keep their vehicles equipped with the latest technology.

Moreover, in the near future, only fully autonomous vehicles will hold true value. Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) capability V12.5, recently launched in North America, markedly improved perception and decision-making in complex scenarios. FSD has accumulated over 1.6 billion miles driven to date. The Q2 2024 Tesla Vehicle Safety Report indicated that while the average American car experiences one accident every million miles driven, Tesla vehicles with Autopilot active experienced one accident per 10.7 million miles, reflecting a significant enhancement in safety.

Currently, Tesla is the only brand offering vehicles equipped with hardware and software for FSD capability, positioning its future product value significantly higher than current prices.",24,22,Far_Wolverine1730,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1ff1cr8/tesla_slips_to_8th_on_wsb_despite_ai_breakthrough/,1ff1cr8

2024-09-05 13:54:34,r/stocks,(9/5) - Thursday's Pre-Market News &amp; Stock Movers,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, September the 5th, 2024-

# [Stock futures are flat after two straight down days for S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/04/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were flat Thursday as Wall Street looks to regain momentum after a rocky start to September. Key labor market data is also on deck this week.
*****
&gt; Futures for the S&amp;P 500 were up marginally, while Nasdaq 100 futures hovered near the flatline. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 50 points.
*****
&gt; The moves come after the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each closed lower for the second straight session, dipping 0.16% and 0.30%, respectively. The Dow squeezed out a gain of 38 points, or 0.09%, on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; All three averages are down for the week, with key employment reports looming. On Thursday morning, investors will get to sift through weekly jobless claims data, while the August nonfarm payrolls report is due out Friday.
*****
&gt; The market has appeared to be sensitive to potential growth scares in recent weeks, including Tuesday’s sell-off on the heels of weak manufacturing data. That could put increased importance on the jobless claims data, BMO Wealth Management chief investment officer Yung-Yu Ma said on “Closing Bell.”
*****
&gt; “That’s more of a forward-looking indicator. As long as those stay low — people have jobs, people remain confident in the ability to find jobs or comfortable in the jobs that they have — we think that they will continue to spend. So as long as those numbers stay low, if we get some blips in the overall monthly jobs report that shows weakness on the edges, we’re not quite as concerned,” Ma said.
*****
&gt; The employment data could play a key role in the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision later this month. Ma said he still believes the U.S. economy is on track for a “soft landing” and that the market rally should eventually broaden out. However, he added that there is likely to be continued market turbulence in the near term.
*****
&gt; “We believe in it, we just think it’s going to be on pause for a few months because this high degree of uncertainty we have right now. There’s just too much that needs to resolved over the coming months. … It’s just very hard for the broadening-of-the-market theme to really gather momentum,” Ma said.

2024-08-26 08:44:24,r/stocks,Morgan Stanley is cutting its position in Tesla stock. Here's why,"It seems that Morgan Stanley has finally seen the writing on the wall.

Morgan Stanley said it is slashing its position in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, citing a “continued slowdown in the auto industry, intense competition among electric vehicles (EVs) and reduced consumer preferences” for EVs.

TSLA has been a part of Morgan Stanley’s model portfolio since March 2021, with the position increased in both September and December 2022. However, the stock was reduced in November 2023.

Since the last stake boost in December 2022, Tesla has delivered a 15% return, trailing the Russell 1000 Growth Index (RLG) by 46%, Morgan Stanley strategists highlighted.

“While we continue to hold a position in TSLA, due to the optionality of its various nonauto assets, we see an attractive opportunity to reallocate some of the position to other, less-volatile stocks that are not as economically sensitive and may have less pricing pressure,” they wrote.

Despite Tesla’s status as the leading electric vehicle company in the U.S., with potential growth avenues in robotics, AI, and energy storage, the strategists have decided to reduce the position to make room for stocks with higher earnings viability such as Spotify (NYSE:SPOT).

Earlier this week, the European Union announced that it would reduce planned tariffs on Tesla vehicles imported from China, lowering them from 20.8% to 9%. The EU is also cutting planned import duties for several other electric vehicle manufacturers.

These new tariffs will be in addition to the existing 10% duties already imposed by the EU on battery electric vehicle imports.

In June, the EU indicated it would impose higher tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports, arguing that these vehicles ""heavily benefit from unfair subsidies"" and present a ""threat of economic injury"" to European EV producers.",246,83,NeighborhoodOld7075,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1f1hou9/morgan_stanley_is_cutting_its_position_in_tesla/,1f1hou9

I was doing some reflecting, looking at my portfolio that I have slowly been building since July / Aug of 2021. I have mostly been doing stock picking based on companies I liked, and unfortunately I have come to the realization that I have missed out on quite a bit of gains from not simply investing in VOO or SPY. My total return on three years of investing is 25% (although last week it peaked at 39%, which probably goes to show that I am over exposed), but had I just put my money in VOO in a dollar cost averaging method, I would likely have a much higher return.

Any advice for me? Should I just sell things off and put them in VOO? My current portfolio breakdown looks like this. Of course some bigger losers I have sold off. *$7934 invested, $9950 current.*

2024-08-01 20:13:46,r/stocks,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&amp;P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&amp;P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&amp;P 500 over the next 24 months.

2024-07-30 06:39:23,r/TSLA,Does anyone use a leveraged TSLA short ETFs as a hedge during brief periods of volatility like earnings calls?,"So I own TSLA for a long term investment and have only recently gotten in to trading a 2x leveraged long ETF to increase profits when the market's moving up strongly.

I've made some decent profits over the past month with only minor loses during the recent setback but trailing stop-loss orders kept me protected when it dropped, and thankfully I wasn't holding a position during that massive drop on the 24th ;?)  
But my question is, does anyone use leveraged TSLA short ETFs during expected periods of volatility like the last earnings call (especially considering how in the past these earning's calls have far more tended to lead to drops in the share price)?

I know options are a more common choice for this but while I have dabbled in them I don't feel it's a viable strategy for me as I don't understand a lot of the moving parts (math ;?). But using a 2x TSLA short ETF, like TSLZ, (and I'm only guessing here ;?) I think the downside can be minimized easily enough over short periods of say a few days or a week. But how does it compare to buying Puts to do the same thing, specifically comparing loses in the put's value to the lost value of the underlying ETF (again only for short-term of 5 days or less)

For example if I own 100 shares of TSLA, in order to protect my investment I'd only need to buy an equivalent amount of 2x short ETF shares to cover 50 TSLA shares. Then if the price drops I'm protected and if it moves up I only stand to lose the potential profit, yeah which could be substantial lol, but other than that ""cost"" I don't see any other risks to this strategy.  If anyone understands this better, especially you options traders, can you give me the 411 on this? Thanks in advance for any advice ;?)",17,9,Russspeak,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1efknhn/does_anyone_use_a_leveraged_tsla_short_etfs_as_a/,1efknhn

2024-07-22 22:52:11,r/stocks,Berkshire Hathaway cuts stake in China's BYD to below 5%,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), opens new tab reduced its stake in BYD (002594.SZ), opens new tab to below 5%, in what could be the final time Berkshire discloses stock sales in China's largest producer of electric vehicles.
Berkshire lowered its stake in BYD's issued H-shares to 4.94% from 5.06% on July 16, according to a Monday filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The stake had been 7.02% as recently as June 11.
Hong Kong requires larger shareholders to disclose, opens new tab sales when their resulting stakes fall below whole percentage numbers. Disclosures can stop once ownership stakes fall below 5%.
Berkshire began investing in Shenzhen-based BYD in 2008 when it paid $230 million for about 225 million shares, then equal to a 10% stake.
It began selling BYD shares in August 2022, after the stock price had risen more than 20-fold, and two months after it set a record high.
Charlie Munger, Berkshire's late vice chairman, was the impetus behind the original BYD investment. Berkshire invests mainly in the United States.
BYD was founded by Chinese chemist Wang Chuanfu in 1995 as a maker of rechargeable batteries.
It surpassed billionaire Elon Musk's Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab last year as the world's largest electric vehicle maker, though Tesla has since regained the top spot. In the second quarter, BYD sold 426,039 electric vehicles while Tesla sold 443,956.

2024-07-15 15:23:18,r/stocks,Is PSNY good now?,"I think PSNY is a good buy.

Here is some knowledge for all of the regards who have no idea who PSNY is good luck boy

So PSNY better known as POLESTAR is the EV baby of VOLVO. They got spun off and was basically released from them in early 2024 since Volvo said they were positioned for growth. Okay enough with the fucking history lesson…

The stock has been floating at around $1 USD after being around the $0.70 mark at the end of last month. So they are seeing some positive movement already in the last couple of weeks. This is just due to it being undervalued overall and a correction from what I can tell. 

As of last week they finally broke above there SMA50 and are showing some signs of a recovery. This is good news for a longer look as they should be able to hold at this $1 mark and not need to deal with delisting.

They are expanding into new market and their finances are finally in order. Previously they had some problems with delivering EPS etc but they are now closing the gap on their burn rate and looking towards positivity. 

The company while not selling a large volume of cars is under valued for the number of cars they sell at the current price point. TSLAs price per car is great than a 5X value while PSNY is less than 1/2X that. Okay I know TSLA is awesome so that’s why the price per expect sales is so high… well LCID is at 2 1/2X and they haven’t been doing so hot so once again this company is undervalued for what they are performing.

2024-06-17 21:19:01,r/TSLA,why I’m bullish on tesla robotics,"big background:

one of the main drivers that push the us gdp to grow in the past 60 years after world war 2 is asia (mostly east asian countries)

from 1960-1990: japan, south korea, taiwan, singapore
from 1990-2020: mostly china

the problem:

there is one thing in common in these countries: their economy prospered and new born hit all time low, almost irreversible, combined with irreversible increasing aging population. worse than that, their economy is heavily indebted. boj, japan’s central bank, has been buying stocks etf, maintaining low yield, and watching their exchange rates to suffer because they can’t raise rates without adding more fiscal pressure to their indebted government. korea is similar, and they ban naked short selling. my guess is they don’t want stock market to drop that will add pressure to their social security program.

in 10 years, there will be a gigantic labor shortage in those countries and they will find very difficult to maintain their social security system, and seniors have to work til death, unless you are advocating for a way to magically erase all seniors overnight(unlikely in a democratic country, even china probably won’t do it, because it’s every unethical in east asia culture), then we have to find an alternative to the human labor to produce gdp to maintain their economy, otherwise, it’s very likely their economy going to collapse, because they don’t have enough labor to produce, and they are heavily indebted, and their fiat currency will keep depreciating just like japan, and it could be very likely an end of their society if they couldn’t find enough labor. if we look back to the past, there were numerous examples where society collapsed because their economy collapsed, Weimar for example).

the solution:
 apparently tesla believes humanoid labor can fill these labor shortage, and elon said in an interview that gdp = gdp per capita x capita, in the classic economy, capita is usually equivalent to human, but in the era of robotics, capita could mean humanoid robots and if tesla could mass produce robots, it could potentially boost economic productivity at very low cost, imagine all the money invested on human since born from school to work, all saved!) one year college tuition in the us is probably $10k -$20k, and imagine tesla can build a omnibus robot at cost of one year college tuition.

I’m very glad that tesla is trying to solve this humanity problems. elon has been famous for advocating for having more kids but we know this is a systemic trend that can’t be reversed. it hit east asia and some european countries first, and it will hit the us eventually. i believe elon has foreseen this problem already and that might explain why elon is pushing for humanoid robot.",0,0,[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1di6f5o/why_im_bullish_on_tesla_robotics/,1di6f5o

2024-06-10 04:31:41,r/TSLA,A Force of Nature,"&gt;By August 2017, Musk remained hyper-focused on Model 3 production, which was proving slow and painful. As Musk described at trial, “The sheer amount of pain required to achieve that goal, there are no words to express.” This aspect of Musk’s testimony was totally credible.  
  
- [Tornetta v Musk - Post Trial Opinion](https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=359340), p. 56

I have seen no serious contention that Musk was not instrumental in achieving a net 10+ multiple of Tesla's market cap under his compensation plan. The best attempt I've seen is a few claims that really Tesla is about the rest of its talent (implying he has nothing to do with drawing and organizing talent), and that he is just a well-publicized incompetent pretender. Oh, and same with SpaceX, Neuralink, and the rest. Does anyone seriously believe this? Musk couldn't possibly do more to prove himself. It's literally rocket science AND brain surgery.

The trial judge did not question this. The entire decision appears to rest on the claim that the voting shareholders were misinformed because the board members were described as ""independent"", when in fact they are mostly friendly Musk. Also, with Musk on the job, the board suddenly said the goals were ""achievable"" when getting loans and making internal stretch forecasts. And there was hope they would reach a point of growth inflection...something that was clearly not a probability without herculean efforts. Well, yes, turns out that for once they were achievable...with an incentivized Elon. (See [Opinion](https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=359340) starting p. 82.)

So one punk rocker with less than ten shares complained and was the only one willing to go to court. Where was everyone else who thinks this was a travesty? In the meantime, as Elon was sleeping on factory floors, hitting stretch goals, and the stock became a meteor, then the court proceedings dragged on until AFTER he had accomplished his goals, and THEN decided, well, the shareholders wouldn't have voted for this if they had any inkling the board members were Musk's friends. Imagine that. A company where the founder has friends on the board.

It's much too late after he's made the effort and hit the goals. The judgment was ""entirely unfair"", and such a claim by someone with a few shares borders on spurious. The lawyers' ask is worth its own litigation in terms of the damages they are attempting to inflict on Tesla and its shareholders. Furthermore, these lawyers argued a case against stratospheric compensation based on principle and then argued that that same principle doesn't apply to *themselves*. THEY should be paid astronomical sums with Tesla stock for clawing back performance-only based compensation. What unparalleled logic and chutzpah.

In 2022, Elon famously bought Twitter and exposed some incredibly evil, large-scale machinations of censorship and government coercion. [Matt Taibbi](https://www.racket.news) documents this extensively, but a major thread is that anyone the government didn't like was identified as ""Russian"" and censored, even against Twitter's better judgment. See [Hamilton 68](https://reason.com/2023/01/27/twitter-files-matt-taibbi-hamilton-68-russian-bots-fake/), which was totally debunked, with receipts. Since then, he has been the clear target of wide-ranging smear campaigns. One example, the Wall Street Journal repeatedly puts automatic Tesla software updates on the front page as ""safety recalls"". (Yes, the NTSB is in on that designation. Virtually any tweak theoretically affects ""safety"".) That's not news, it's a campaign to denigrate Tesla.

The rest of the media is also replete with stories about how Elon is just so *problematic* all of a sudden! I leave as an exercise to the reader to study the extent to which they are contrived smears, some sillier than others, some outright defamatory (like ""anti-Semitic""). But it is surely a coincidence that these same detractors and their bosses used to be emotionally invested in having a Twitter that censored their political opposition.

2024-06-08 16:26:43,r/TSLA,Elons Compensation Package  ,"If you are a Tesla shareholder and even remotely connected to recent events, you are undoubtedly aware of the pivotal vote set for June 13, 2024. This vote will determine whether Elon Musk’s compensation package, initially proposed in 2018 but subsequently denied by a Delaware judge, will finally be approved.

Having been a shareholder for over two years, I deeply appreciate the extraordinary value Mr. Musk brings to Tesla. He stands out as one of the most visionary and capable CEOs of our time. While his candidness occasionally leads to controversy, this unfiltered approach is a hallmark of his unique effectiveness and unparalleled leadership.

As a Tesla shareholder, I fully support Mr. Musk's compensation package. The contract, established in 2018, presented significant challenges for Musk, yet he has consistently surpassed expectations, achieving what many deemed impossible. I firmly believe he has earned this compensation, and I am confident that his actions, with or without this package, will continue to benefit Tesla shareholders in the long term. It feels unjust that a single shareholder, holding a mere nine shares, has obstructed the progress and potential gains for millions of us invested in Tesla’s future.

Though I lack experience with legal proceedings, I question whether we, the majority, have recourse if this compensation package is again denied. Is there a possibility to counter-sue Richard Tornetta and his attorney for interfering with our investments? It seems unreasonable that a minority shareholder should wield such influence over the 73% who voted in favor of Mr. Musk's compensation.

I eagerly await your insights on this matter.

""As executive compensation plans go, Tesla’s is about as friendly to shareholders as they come. Many other companies have installed outsized packages that often come at the expense of shareholders because the executives get paid even when they underperform their peers... “It’s heads you win, tails you don’t lose,” meaning if Mr. Musk is gaining billions then shareholders are winning, too. And if Mr. Musk does not perform, shareholders pay nothing.""

""If Mr. Musk were somehow to increase the value of Tesla to $650 billion—a figure many experts would contend is laughably impossible and would make Tesla one of the five largest companies in the United States, based on current valuations.""

It would be unfair to renegotiate the terms after Elon has fulfilled his obligations. If this deal falls through, Elon would have essentially worked for free for the past six years. It is important for our CEO to have a vested interest in the company's success. We should not demoralize the individual who has had the most significant impact on this company throughout its history.

2024-06-07 21:31:36,r/TSLA,People blaming Elon for buying TSLA,"Rant:

I’ve been reading a lot how people keep blaming Elon for buying the stock. Quite sick and tired of hearing this, and a very ignorant thing to say… we are all adults, we should understand what we invest in and take responsibility for it. Plain and simple. 

He went on record saying he thinks the stock was too high in May 2020. Then the stock goes up by 200% by end of the year. He did interviews talking about him going on record that he thinks the stock is too high. Not sure how clear he could be… IMO if anyone bought any time after May 2020 and you’re down, that’s 100% on you. Talking about future products and making it exciting is part of his job. 

“Ok, well he said stock will go up 40% every year right!?” No, he said the company will grow 40% meaning revenue not stock. What the revenue effect has on the stock he has no control over and cannot predict so he didn’t. But people heard what they wanted to hear. 

“But it didn’t grow by 40%!!!” Car sales grew by 38% in 2023. Still in the middle of 2024. But if investors did not anticipate one year here and there up or down a few basis points then they’re being unrealistic… the fact they grew at all in 2023 with rising rates is an achievement by itself. 

People do not want to admit they were really just influenced by the mainstream media, TikTok/youtube influencers, and constant price target increases. Now look how many of them talk trash about the stock, just to save face cause they hyped up the stock so much. It’s always Elon’s fault though right?

The lesson they could get out of this is, ok, maybe don’t jump in hype/meme stocks. Don’t invest into something I don’t understand. But no, they blame Elon… he told them to buy the stock…. It’s really just pathetic. It’s real unfortunate they are allowed to vote.

2024-05-05 16:48:07,r/TSLA,Vote For will not dilute the stock price by 10%. Here is why,"The market had already accounted for the dilution resulting from the stock grants in the 2021-2022 compensation package. What the market did not anticipate was the Delaware judge’s ruling that voided this pay package. If this ruling is anti-dilutive, should the stock price not have risen by 10% following this decision? Instead, the stock price fell nearly 10% the same week and continued to drop until a recent rally, following Elon’s visit to China to accelerate FSD deployment in the Chinese market.

So, why did the stock price fall? It fell due to the uncertainty resulting from this ruling, and the market dislikes uncertainty because it’s a risk that is hard to quantify, requiring a higher risk premium on the underlying asset. Another factor the market dislikes is conflicts between shareholders and executives, and potential proxy fights. A vote against the pay package would exacerbate this uncertainty and risk, potentially further tanking the stock price and causing more permanent damage to market confidence in repairing the relationship between shareholders and executives. This might lead some major investors to sell to protect their investments, with fewer buying before the conflict is resolved.

Therefore, a vote FOR this pay package would not only avoid diluting shares—since this has long been priced in—but also restore market confidence in Tesla and its management’s ability to lead the company in the long term.

PS: I understand many people here are upset with Elon due to something he recently posted on X, but I’m trying to convince you that for the long-term benefit, Elon remains the best leader to grow Tesla from $500 billion to $5 trillion in the era of AI/Robotics. Achieving that level by focusing solely on the car business is implausible. And I tend to think it’s easier to motivate the leader to dedicate more time and effort to Tesla by rewarding him with more shares, as Charlie Munger said: ""Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.""

edit: For those who think Mercedes and Google are ahead of Tesla. You can hate Elon but please stop insulting Tesla. I’m quite speechless. You should talk to some Waymo engineers about this… Here is a recent ex Waymo engineer who jumped Waymo for Tesla because he believes Tesla’s FSD. https://x.com/charles_rqi?s=21
This dude join tesla because Elon’s focus on FSD development, because Elon would spend billions of dollars to build AI infrastructure, and cutting costs from other departments accordingly. This time, supercharger department is affected, unfortunately. I wish Tesla has unlimited resources to play in this game but unfortunately GPU and topnotch AI talents cost lots of money. So before you vote against the pay package, I want you to seriously consider did Elon really failed at leading when Tesla is the top leader in autonomous vehicles? These talents would be very disappointed if Elon left.",0,0,[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1cksx0b/vote_for_will_not_dilute_the_stock_price_by_10/,1cksx0b

2024-05-03 03:29:35,r/TSLA,Why All In AI is justified ,"Great return comes with great risk. An insane valuation needs an insane business model that no one has seen or has modeled before. AI robotaxi and Optimus have the potential to achieve that. 
Superchargers sound cool but it’s just a business model of running gas stations, and no gas station companies are going to be worth trillions. It’s a boring predictable business model imo. And it requires large amounts of capital to build for a small marginal benefits as most people just charge at home. Hybrids selling better than EV is the proof. And given the standard has been set, it’s time for other players (gas station companies or Rivian) to come in. Nothing wrong with being boring and predictable. Warren Buffett likes boring predictable business, and you should go buy BRK not TSLA. 
I think Elon wants to save capital to invest in AI infrastructure over building Superchargers. 
I personally have no issue with installing lidar sensors but we should have a fundamental understanding that lidar sensor is nothing intelligent. It works like a ruler, just a tool for human, but AI is fundamentally about estimating using something like our brain. Maybe Tesla would install lidar in the end. Who knows? But it’s not going to happen before they successfully trained the best vision AI model. There are many evidence showing that pure vision AI can estimate distance so lidar is really not necessary unless its cost is meaningfully lower than its current cost and adding one can meaningfully increase its accuracy or lower the chance of disengaging. Btw, many Chinese companies have onboarded with pure vision AI after they tried FSD.

2024-04-28 00:03:09,r/TSLA,"Facebook Cofounder Says Tesla Has Committed ""Consumer Fraud on a Massive Scale,"" Will End in Jail","Heads Will Roll
Amidst a chaotic month for Tesla — even by its continuously plunging standards — Facebook cofounder and multi-billionaire Dustin Moskovitz has made some pretty dire predictions for the automaker, accusing it of committing ""consumer fraud on a massive scale.""

""This is Enron now, folks,"" Moskovitz wrote on Threads, referring to the corporation that went bankrupt in 2001 after it was exposed for one of the biggest accounting frauds in history. ""It may keep going, but people are going to jail at the end.""

His concerns stem from a graph Tesla shared to mark a key milestone: one billion miles driven using Full Self-Driving, the company's highly fraught advanced driver assist system. He then compares it with a new graph released during Tesla's latest earnings call — an event that came with its own eyebrow raising moments.

The point of the side-by-side is this: according to Moskovitz, the automaker is wrongly recognizing its deferred revenue — revenue for a product that hasn't been delivered, like an annual subscription fee — as earned revenue through the wider release of its Autopark feature last month. This is a sketchy move, Moskovitz claims, because an earlier version of Autopark was already released with FSD years ago, resulting in inflated numbers.

""The data is presented in fraudulent ways, and it doesn't say what they claim it says even when they make it up,"" he wrote.

So I buy a 50k Tesla. And Elon wants you use it for distibuted compute while it sits idle in my garage. Assume this compute uses 1kW (his number), okay however???

1. Will my Tesla still be fully charged in the morning?
2. Am I supposed to pay for the electricty to power this compute?
3. Shouldn't I be paid for renting out the compute power of MY car?
4. Doesn't my 50 Mb internet connection severly throttle my cars ability to add functional compute to this Zerg. And if it borks my streaming Elon can go pound sand.
5. The Tesla also won't have sufficient local memory, unless its designed in solely to support this function and help mitigate the bandwidth limitations.

Don't think 1M Teslas, in their current form will be replacing AI-DCs anytime soon.

EDIT: Apparently I missed the part about Tesla paying for the compute. 4 &amp; 5 are my real points. Bandwidth and local/fast/large memory pools are extremely important for AI type compute loads.

EDIT2: To everyone just blindly claiming sure the Tesla will still be fully charged overnight:

*Level 2 Wall Connector: A Tesla Wall Connector will give your vehicle a 44-mile range per hour charged, and you can expect a fully charged battery between* ***6 to 12 hours*** *after you plug in, depending on the model.*

The company has announced a reduction of over 14,000 jobs worldwide, particularly impacting its major operations in the U.S. and China.

Elon attributes these layoffs to a drop in sales and increasing competition in the EV market. This decision is reflective of broader challenges facing the industry, not just Tesla. A recent analysis indicates a significant reduction in job postings among leading EV manufacturers over the past three months. This trend could be an early indicator of the challenges that lie ahead for the sector, suggesting a possible reevaluation of growth strategies among these companies.

Tesla has an obsession with shooting himself in the feet.  
I understand that Musk may dislike the press and everything related to it, but he must understand, ADVERTISING IN THESE MEDIA IS IMPORTANT, BECAUSE THEY ATTRACT PURCHASES.  
The best example is Toyota, the reason why it sells many millions a year is because they made sure that the press promotes them year after year, they pay for influencer reviews to favor them, but they have had market recalls due to problems In many of its models, for many people, Toyota is the best brand with well-built cars.  
Unfortunately that's how the market works, the other manufacturers understood it and also do the same.  
Obviously this deceives the user, but that's how the market works.  
Then you have Tesla, which does the opposite, isolating itself in a bubble, which refuses to come out.  
If FSD prices have also begun to drop, they are using the same pattern as they do with cars, out of desperation to get more customers in the short term, losing value in the long term.

2024-04-21 03:12:28,r/TSLA,Why Elon deserves the $50B pay package and why this whole situation is ridiculous.,"Imagine this:

Meta hires you as a product manager for a new project. You lead this project ground up; you hire everyone you need, come up with the product, work on the design, engineering, production, and anything and everything else involved with a zero-to-market project.

Let’s say you’re REALLY confident in your capability to make this happen. You create an EXTREMELY ambitious timeline of financial and operational objectives that’s undeniably and unbelievably generous in favor of the shareholders, Meta in this case.

The actual plan is that you will basically 13x Meta’s investment over 10 years and you get paid nothing if you don’t. Your ""vesting period"" is 1% every $50B of investment appreciation, meaning you get paid 1% of $50B for every $50B increase in the value of the investment. Meta gives you a starting budget of $50B and you would, according to your plan, 13x this to $650B and get paid 1% of $50B, every $50B. Keep in mind that getting nothing by not meeting the goals is meant to be taken literally; the plan is a 100% at-risk performance award, meaning you receive absolutely nothing, $0, if you don’t reach each of these milestones in the specified timeframe.

This is an extremely favorable deal for Meta, isn’t it? Obviously, they accept this proposition.

You tackle the project and are so good at what you do, that you hit the 13x goal in 5 years. This equates to growing Meta's $50B investment to the $650B goal in 5 years, and you are to be paid $6.5B (1% of $50B = $500M, $500M \* 13 = $6.5B).

(To all that say ""$6.5B isn't $50B"", in Elon's case the $6.5B represents stock options that are now worth $50B AFTER he grew the company to it's current size. Realistically, it was probably only worth $2-4B whenever this compensation plan was implemented.)

Just like after your first project that you grew from $3B to $50B, you go to Zuck’s office to collect your paycheck (that you aren’t allowed to cash in for another 5 years to prove your commitment to the project and company). Right as you get to his door, a level 1 customer support employee making minimum wage walks in and says “hey, I don’t think $6.5B is fair.” Zuck then turns to you and says ""Hey, I know you took on this job for zero upfront pay and pay based only on performance, which you exceeded expectations on, but this guy who understands nothing about what you achieved said that's unfair so I'm gonna have to revoke your pre-agreed upon pay package and pay you $0.""

Now, replace Meta with us (the shareholders) and you with Elon. This is, in essence, what Elon is experiencing right now. If you were in this situation, would you think that's fair? And I'm sure to Elon, it's not even all about the money; if he were financially motivated, he wouldn't have risked 100% of his net worth on saving Tesla and SpaceX years ago and would've just retired off of his PayPal earnings.

It's the injustice that is taking on near-impossible milestones that exists only for the betterment of Tesla shareholders and human civilization, hitting those milestones, and then being denied of the proper, deserved recognition by the very people he benefitted.

It's the pure absurdity that is someone like Kathaleen McCormick, who is unafraid to show and rule based on her personal biases over facts, being allowed to hold so much power.

Let's do our part to try to make this right. We, retail investors as a collective, have the power to get this passed. All we need to do is vote in favor of Proposal Four in Tesla's Annual Meeting of Stockholders on June 13, 2024 - ratification of the 2018 CEO Performance Award.

BY MT NEWSWIRES — 16 MINUTES AGO
08:35 AM EDT, 04/19/2024 (MT Newswires) -- Tesla (TSLA) is recalling nearly 3,900 of its Cybertrucks due to a defective accelerator pedal pad, according to a US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recall report.

According to the report, when high force is applied to the accelerator in the affected vehicles, the pad may dislodge and could cause the pedal to become trapped in the interior trim above the pedal, which could increase the risk of a collision.

The recall population includes all 2024 model-year Cybertrucks manufactured between Nov. 13, 2023, and April 4.

Some of you may recognize this quote:

Thousands of years ago the first man discovered how to make fire. He was probably burnt at the stake he'd taught his brothers to light, but he left them a gift they had not conceived and lifted darkness from the face of the earth.

Elon is such a man, and Tesla is such a fire, and the media are such those who would rather see the world turned to ash in darkness than ever see Elon and his dream of a clean energy future take hold. 

It is abundantly clear that there is a major movement afoot to exaggerate every single problem at Tesla and blow small events way out of proportion.

Routine staffing adjustments are referred to as mass layoffs. A minor tweak in the cybertruck pedal is called a catastrophic design flaw.

Positive results and events at Tesla are not being covered, in some cases the press is actively ignoring breakthroughs like full self driving v12.

How much stock is being accumulated by market insiders off of this negativity? How much wealth is being siphoned away from loyal, honest investors to deep pocketed speculators?

But the manufactured negativity cannot outlast the truth. Elon's spirit and the spirit of every Tesla shareholder who believes in the mission and believes in Elon as the leader to usher in a new era of clean energy, is unbreakable.

Wondering what you guys think the 5-10yr outlook may look like for profits generated by Robotaxi.

Admittedly, I’m a holder but wouldn’t consider myself part of the TSLA “cult”, so apologies if this has been one of those topics that have been beaten to death for longs.

My main (and limited) assumptions would be that TSLA either foots the whole experience themselves, or they partner with a Hertz or other to help subsidize the upfront costs/operate the day-to-day— the upfront costs seem pretty large…
- Assuming need to beef charging stations up by 150-500% across American (other countries not included)
- Assuming TSLA (and maybe partner(s)) would need to produce, front, and maintain these cars

And then assuming that they keep taxi fares the same (i expect TSLA fares to be competitively low) they will be left making pennies on the dollar (low single digits is historical avg with human driver + gasoline). But again, it seems like Elon is partial to the strategy of out-pricing the competition, so I would think the fares would be cheaper than today’s taxi cab.

With these assumptions, i believe that Robotaxi will not be as monumental profits-wise, as many are expecting. What do you guys think?

It's hard to know exactly when. But having turned a corner with v12 I think we are getting closer to the exponential phase. Is this blind optimism?

TSLA options could pay off handsomely if the price shoots up like a meme stock again, though they could also expire worthless if the stock tanks. I have 10 years from today to exercise the option, however if I leave the company then I have 3 months from termination to exercise the option.

2024-04-06 13:33:41,r/TSLA,Here's my TSLA analysis after digesting all the info yesterday.  What am I missing / getting wrong?,"Announced Robotaxi unveil 8/8/24.  Rueters articles saying not working on M2 anymore.  The Dr. Know it all take seemed to be pretty good.  Essentially part of the reuters articles seems to be true; scrapping m2 for robotaxi because James Douma analysis saying for example will only need 10k robotaxis to satisfy uber demand in Chicago downtown area, so they don't actually need to make 20m cars a year anymore, but the NPV of those robotaxis is like $200k per vehicle.  So effectively if FSD successful, Tesla will transition to a high margin robotaxi software company and license their software to all ground logistics companies.  Kinda like Windows to PC's will be Tesla FSD to all Tesla cars, and other car manufacturers, and trucks, buses, semi's, etc. companies.    
  
So it really comes down to In Elon We Trust and if FSD will happen.  If they figure out FSD, then they will rule transportation and ground logistics (ARK's FSD analysis).  And Asok tweet ""beginning of end"", and new FSD 12 is great, and miles driven on FSD hit 1b miles and will need to get 6b miles to satisfy reg approval (should hit 6b miles in 1-2 years), and Robotaxi unveil announcement, all this appears to be signal that they will figure it out / have very high confidence they will figure it out.  

  
Questions:    
  
Q:  Can Tesla really just license the software / hardware out to other automakers?   
A: Well FSD works on different Tesla models too.  But Cybertruck doesn't have it yet and Model S/X appears to not be as good as 3/Y.  So it appears it's not a super easy shift over to other vehicles, but Tesla working on it.    
  
Q: What about Chuck Cook's belief about he b-pillar not being sufficient for robotaxi?  
A:  I don't know the answer to this.

Do you have anything to add?  What am I missing / getting wrong?

2024-04-05 01:08:37,r/TSLA,Tesla needs to change its mentality,"Design:  
The cars are great, unsurpassed technology, but they still have the same designs, they have made changes in recent years, but the image remains the same since they came out, I don't know to what extent they have to be minimalist, it takes away a lot of visual value and That may be a reason why some don't buy them.  
Scope:  
It is something that Tesla is weak at, but they have charging stations as a second option, I think they should work on improving autonomy.  
FSD:  
technology in development, but that will not give much value yet, if Tesla shows the regulators that its standard for obtaining a license is wrong, the value of the FSD will be seen, in the meantime it is just a hobby that we can all discuss how it is improving.

  
services and manufacturing:  
Although a lot has been improved in terms of manufacturing, it still needs improvement, but where it is somewhat delayed is in services, Tesla should prioritize improving this part, this way you keep your customers with greater satisfaction when you have problems and they see that the company responds quickly to provide solutions.

  
Marketing  
I think that the management of Tesla, but above all, Elon must understand that Tesla is no longer a startup, it is already a consolidated company, everything has already been tried to promote the company in the way Elon thinks, it is time to try Try old school advertising to see what happens, instead of just dropping prices uncontrollably.  


Models:  
It was unsustainable to have strong sales when you only drive 4 vehicle models. I don't know what happened to Tesla, because no one considered that possibility. I think that was the reason why vehicle prices depressed very quickly.  
PD: Elon should understand that Tesla should not care if he does not like the Biden government, if he fights with Mark Zuckerberg, starts criticizing Microsoft or sues OpenAI, that should not be a reason for Tesla to distance itself from them. , you need to spread the word about the products, not isolate them in X.",0,0,Leo90pe,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1bw22bf/tesla_needs_to_change_its_mentality/,1bw22bf

From OEMs perspective it makes huge sense as capital costs, technological know how, huge real world data to train neural nets seems almost impossible for anyone, which leaves them with only option to either license FSD from Tesla in some form or left out completely from the world of smart and autonomous mobility.  
This licensing of Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology would eventually become a determining factor for the success of legacy auto giants, enabling them to stay relevant in the evolving landscape of autonomy.

Tesla cars are very difficult to steal. You need the phone or keycard, but even than if you use pin to start… they are out of luck. 

Unlike a Toyota where you can quickly break in and reprogram the keyfob receiver and drive away.

Tesla also is a bit like Apple devices where a car is “locked” to an account. So even if they managed to steal the car, resale is not really an option as the car is stuck on someone else’s account. And with Tesla control on repair it’s not as though stripiping the car for parts is super profitable.

People think this is a sign that FSD is now at the point where it’s something they just have to show off.

But, for anyone who is familar with being forced to sit through a time share sales pitch…. That seems more like what they are pulling. Force you to sit through a pitch and then you get your prize.

Reeks of desperation.
And it may cause buyers to just not buy the car if it’s an unskipable requirement to demo FSD.

Also, the prize is not a “free thing” but something you paid big dollars for.

Huge red flag.

Then combine this with them advertising on a rival social media network when Elon swore it off before buying Twitter.

I’m shocked people still think this company has a great future.

Also on a side note…
FSD may seem impressive as a party trick.

But, people are making the assumption that it’s going to be able to make the leap to unsupervised “any day now”…

But, if it were that close I think it would’ve happened already.

My bet is if it’s solvable it may be a decades away.

People forget that through history we have often been teased with “tomorrow’s tech today” and it doesn’t happen fully for 20 years.

Even if it seems close.

Sometimes what seems close is actually far away and the last gap is not easy to overcome.

Look at VR! The virtual boy was in the 90s and we just now have real VR. And it’s still not perfect.

As we all know that Tesla FSD is only available to Tesla cars right now, but lets try to look into the future. A future where Tesla FSD is its own entity. Imagine Tesla FSD an independent AI which not only include in cars but also:  
  
1.Tesla FSD Airplanes: Imaged the software being installed on aircrafts  and commercial airplanes rides.  
  
2.Tesla FSD boats and yachts: Sit back hang out with your friends while Tesla FSD boats drive you around a nice day on the beach.

3. Tesla FSD Robots: Came home from work? Lazy to walk the dogs? Easily route an area for your robots to take the dogs out for a nice walk.

4. Tesla FSD Semi Trucks: We all know that the semi truck driving business is worth over $800 billion in North America, what's stopping company from having a Tesla semi truck with full FSD capability delivering goods and products?

I won't go on, but the possibility are endless. You might dislike or like Elon Musk, but that doesn't change the fact, the future is NOW.",0,0,ItsSung,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1bo96t5/tesla_fsd_not_only_going_to_be_for_regular_cars/,1bo96t5
2024-03-26 14:20:36,r/TSLA,Tesla teasing the future!,"Boss Elon orders all of his employees at Tesla to make sure that every new owner of their cars should experience unreal capabilities of its autonomous technology, a huge differentiator of Teslas with rest.  
Also in order to spread out his words loud and clear, Tesla to provide free month long trial to existing cars as well which are capable of rolling in FSD.  
With this hard push we may conclude that; team Tesla is looking very confident with refinement of current versions of its FSD so as it make it available to wider set of people and is **ready to make a big transition towards being a ‘software(AI)‘ first company going forward**.

2024-03-15 21:13:29,r/TSLA,$TSLA market cap will never be under 1 trillion after this year,"TL;DR I work in deep tech, I did not believe proper full self driving can be done, but it's happening for fucking real. v12.3 is genuinely close to the real FSD that Elon has been promising since 2016. There's zero reason why this won't propel $TSLA to trillion-dollar club.

I'd originally bought $TSLA at $20 (adjusted for splits) back in 2018, sold most of it in 2021 (helped me buy a house), and started loading up again since last week. I work in tech, and deeply understand engineering. There were many reasons for selling my shares besides needing cash. For example, I did not believe in the business prospects of Cybertruck, Optimus, solar roof, and similar new products. But by far the biggest reason was I couldn't see FSD happening for real, because of technical limitations. Elon has himself said that Tesla valuation should be close to nothing if FSD does not materialize. Without getting into too many details, I studied the technicalities behind it, and my conclusion was it's just not possible. And it started to feel like Elon is trying to hide that reality and fool people (and himself).

But, a new technology arrived, and that conclusion became invalid. And I've been amazed how swiftly a large company like Tesla has taken full advantage of it.

We all know something changed in the technology space since 2022: large neural nets (built upon the transformer architecture) that power ChatGPT, Bard/Gemini, etc. This same technology has started powering Tesla FSD since last couple of versions of it. Similar to how first version of ChatGPT was very good, but with many flaws, all new FSD (with end-to-end neural nets) was very good, but with many flaws. Well, now v12.3 is out, as of last week, and it's now *extremely good, with very few flaws*. It's really just a matter of solving edge cases now; at least as far as launching it in the US is concerned.

I actually believe now there is no technical reason why true FSD cannot be done. In fact I think it'll be fully achieved this year itself. And we all know Elon is going to demo the shit out of this – may be even dedicate an entire public event to this by end of year. When that happens there's nothing stopping $TSLA from getting to ATH and beyond. So I'm buying.

Most if not all big financial institutions are negative or neutral over TSLA right now; What’s causing this?  
**Shortsightedness. Period.**  
Yes, Tesla isn’t going to grow in high double digit percentage this year, if Trump arrives market wouldn’t perceive that as big +ve for EVs in general, interest rates aren’t coming down as quickly as everybody thought it would.  
\- But think if any of these is going to delay compact car next year. - NO;  
\- Is energy business going to grow with hefty margins. - YES;  
\- CyberTruck will create multiplier effect. - YES;  
\- FSD as new normal 5-8 years down the line. - YES;  
\- Optimus real world applications considering aging population of many developed economies. - BIG YES.  
**So folks if you could forsee future and ignore a year, accumulate this once in a lifetime opportunity.**

2024-03-14 19:40:48,r/TSLA,How much had been dropped during the first 50 trading days of 2024?,"TSLA closed at 248.48 on 29 December 2023 (i.e. last trading day of 2023).  
  
TSLA closed at 169.48 on 13 March 2024 (i.e. yesterday) - which would be its 10-month low since May 2023.  
  
That being said, TSLA dropped 79.00 or 31.79% during the first 50 trading days of 2024.  
  
This could be the worst opening since 2021 \~  
  
  
  
Gong forward, the question is which direction will TSLA move to?  
  
Short-term speaking, the stock could be oversold consider less than 10 million short interest had been increased between 29 December 2023 and 29 February 2024, it implied that most of the sellers in the market would primarily be long-position holders who had been cutting losses, unless they are holding TSLA for more than 10 months.  
  
Long-term speaking, the headwind in the EV industry remains strong, which will be reflected by the 2024Q1 delivery numbers and earnings release. At least, everybody knows that (1) EV demand is growing much slower globally and (2) fierce competition among many existing and new players - first mover like Tesla will also suffer. Situation will only be improved when market consolidation heats up.  
  
After all, TSLA may be considered for speculation now but not for value investing at this moment \~

2024-03-14 14:55:19,r/TSLA,Do you really think FSD is possible? And if not won’t that tank the stock?,"Even Elon said Tesla is worthless without FSD.

And he had a point. For the company to be valued more like tech this is the killer app.
Otherwise, it’s a car company.

But, while something like what Waymo is doing may be possible … FSD is a long way away if it’s even doable.

And yes we see Tesla pumpers showing off their interventionless drives…
That’s different than something that can do it every time.. any where… any type of weather.

You know who has stopped making crazy promises about FSD?

Tesla!

If they really thought it was as close as bloggers want you to believe they would be releasing videos like that Paint it Black video instead of letting the stock slide like it has.

Because that would expose them to lawsuits.

Because they know that FSD is unlikely to ever be good enough to be really autonomous. They’ve even admitted it in legal fillings! 


And the canary in the coal mine moment is Apple closing it’s EV project up.

They wanted a truly autonomous vehicle.
And even with the brightest minds in the world they decided it was a problem they couldn’t solve.

And they also could buy Tesla if they wanted.
If they thought Tesla was on to something with FSD they would’ve literally just bought the company if it would’ve helped them with their EV project.

Same with Google.


What makes Tesla more likely to be able to solve it?

What gives Tesla the edge?

Real world data?

I highly doubt that. 
Apple could’ve solved it if that was what it took.

You believe it would’ve been beyond Apple’s ability to get the same sort of data?

Literally all they would have to do is make a deal with automotive companies …

Have them have cameras on their cars and have CarPlay collect the data and give customers a discount on AppleCare!

Same with Google and android.
If google thought it was worthwhile they could have two autonomous vehicle projects going.

One with Waymo’s approach and the other like FSD.

They could also get billions of real miles. They could pay people money….

Partner with automaker and literally pay people to do a beta program through android auto. If they even thought it had a 10% chance of being viable they would have their own program.

Google is the king of AI based research. People are delusional to think Tesla has secret sauce over them.

You MUST read about it as soon as possible to understand where the industry is heading to. As text-to-video generative model became true with the help of the super powerful H100 microships by Nvidia, you should expect even more sophisticated models using their cutting edge tech H200. Training FSD vehicles won't be mainly dependent on customer vehicles collected data or data collection fleets. A modeler will define the physics rules, a real life scenario, cameras position and many unimaginable criterions. Those generated scenarios will be in millions and will cover all possible scenarios of snowy or slippery roads, to pedestrians trying to cross the street in fog, and many more. The results would be trained models that are trained to behave optimally by training reinforcement learning models.

FSD is closer than ever before!

Some would run right away to read introductions and I am pretty sure they won't understand anything of what they are reading.

2024-02-04 08:08:49,r/TSLA,Elon is bailing and so should you,"I purchased my first Tesla shares in 2016, right after the announcement event for the Model 3. It was my first investment in something other than an index fund, but after the presentation that evening I couldn't NOT pull the trigger. It was the most optimistic I've ever been about a company. I continued buying more shares every month during all of 2017, 2018, and 2019. Even though I could barely afford it, a big part of every paycheck during those years went to increasing my stake in Tesla. Over time, I built up what was (for me) an absolutely massive position.

That obviously turned out to be the right move. By 2021, my initial investment had 30x'd, so I cashed out a small portion to buy a Model 3, the same vehicle I had fallen in love with all those years earlier. The cost of the car was tiny compared to the money I had made owning the stock, and the plan was to hold onto the rest until I retired. Then in November 2021, Elon started selling. It feels silly to say this, but I have to admit I felt a bit betrayed. Up until that point, his motto had always been ""first in, last out."" While that clearly wasn't true anymore, I decided to hang tight.

Fuck me, that was a dumb decision. Elon perfectly timed the all time pico top of this thing. Ever since, it's been lower highs and lower lows, year after year, with no end in sight. I could put up with the twitter drama and cringey edgelord shit, but the most recent earnings call was the last straw. I've been listening to those calls for years, and you can tell in his voice Elon is OVER this company. These days, he's obviously more interested in railing against ""illegals"" and poopsocking Diablo than he is about clean energy or even space. He's sure as shit not sleeping on that factory floor ever again. My prediction is he steps down as CEO in the next 12 months.

So yeah, I'm out. It was a fun ride, but this is where I get off. If Elon's not invested in the company anymore, why should we be?",210,168,WhiskeyKnight,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1aii0wb/elon_is_bailing_and_so_should_you/,1aii0wb
2024-02-04 05:18:36,r/TSLA,Load up on TSLA,"Elon is playing 4D chess with his latest political moves. 

He has already locked in liberals with Teslas. He cut prices so fiercely that they can never sell their Teslas even if they wanted to boycott Elon. 

Now to lock in the remaining 45%, talking about sustainability is counterproductive. These customers actually love carbon emissions. So, a strategy of “Own a Tesla to own a lib” can work beautifully.  Bashing DEI, dems and immigrants will get Tesla new customers, who probably would never buy an EV based for rational reasons. Also, if the growth still doesn’t accelerate this year, he can blame the failure on cancel culture by dems. This would most definitely rile up the base and boost sales as his new target customer segment is known to ignore self interest as long as they could spite the libs. If he could get Trump to endorse Tesla, the stock would double in no time. 

I say load up on TSLA. It’s becoming a cultural icon, even if technologically and functionally it’s falling behind.  It’s a brand play now just like Coke and Pepsi - what he builds or sells doesn’t matter. He knows it but will investors realize this?

2024-02-03 22:33:17,r/TSLA,Long term bull trying to grasp the recent short term pain with tin-foil hat,"The following is a far-out take. But in a market where A.I. prospects are pumping like candy, and Tesla has been doing all but, it can't help but make me think why. I know forward PE isn't the greatest but it almost all but doesn't matter too much recently for every other tech company in the market.

Elon's rhetoric was giving me the creeps recently.  He's usually very optimistic despite headwinds.He just seemed off when he threatened to take A.I. elsewhere, out from Tesla. That alone gave me red flag vibes. Even if it isn't true it may be hinting at another underlying issue to shareholders who are carefully paying attention.

I'm not implying that he's trying to warn us in some conspiratorial matter, but rather a symptom of a underlying situation, and maybe it's his subconscious way of verbalizing out loud to those listening, ""sell if you're trying to time it""

So what's the underlying issue? Elon still having a twitter debt leveraged over his shares - which I speculate he will eventually get margin called on again, sometime this year. Firms know this which may be why they are avoiding it so they can buy more for cheaper. After all he HAS to sell those shares, unless someone can confirm otherwise. If firms are going to bid big chunks of Elon's shares over the better half of a week, why would they buy them for more? They would want to bid for as little as possible. They can just avoid buying in the meantime and keep volume low.

And It's exactly what they did last time. Elon had to sell for cheap. It's business, they know who's leveraged and they take advantage if possible. And maybe Elon's a big enough fish to hunt here. Perhaps it's the real reason why Elon is trying to call on more shares. 

This concludes my tin-foil hat theory and I think this is closer to the truth than something like a high PEG ratio regarding last few month's price action. Again, it's been a full-on buy risk market since November and Tesla had no problem trading for higher last year.",26,11,Commercial-Top-9501,https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLA/comments/1ai6tvc/long_term_bull_trying_to_grasp_the_recent_short/,1ai6tvc

2024-01-18 18:13:31,r/TSLA,"Why I think(/home) v12 FSD could be a game changer for the company (and thus, the stock).","My pricing theory in a nutshell - most things have been ""priced in"" around the $700bn-$1tn market cap levels ($1tn is about $315 a share).  Tesla was in the $1tn club at one point in time, but with a lot of other things pulling back - plus higher interest rates certainly impacting some aggregate demand - they are not.  I believe they can get back into the $1tn club again - but not off of the current pipeline, plus reasonable overall unit sales growth.

Despite what some YouTube'r who just loaded up on shares at the $100 dip might think *based on their buy price* and how Tesla is clearly going to $1,000 a share - that's not how markets work.  Or rather, I should say that's not how institutional advisors think.  They don't think in share prices, because they're buying blocks in huge sizes.  So they look at market cap.  More specifically, they start looking at market caps of other companies and ponder - is Tesla worth more than Microsoft?  Than Apple?  Than Saudi Aramco?  Then all of those combined?  (because that's what the ""*Tesla shares to $2,500!*"" people on YT are effectively saying)

IMO, no.  At least not on a short(ish) time horizon.

2024 will be the year of FSD as the best possible mover for the stock.  It's not Robotaxi, because Robotaxi is 100% dependent on FSD.  And it's not more sales of 3, Y, etc.  Power could move them but it will be slow.  A $25k model 2 could really move the needle, though - but since we don't know anything more than rumors and speculation on that ... IMO it's all on v12 this year for Tesla.  It gives them many more upsell (higher margin) opportunities on new cars, and a bunch of upgrade sales opportunities to the existing fleet.  Plus licensing opportunities to every other automobile manufacturer on the planet.

Why do I think(/hope) v12 - all neural nets - will be different?  Simply because we've seen v11 hit a limit on what I can do.  For those of you driving on it, you probably have some scenarios like this one:

* Driving down expressway, in the right lane.  An entrance ramp starts to come in from your right side.  The painted line on the right hand side suddenly moves way out to the right to accomodate the entrance merge lane ... so what does your Tesla do?  What it's basic IF-THEN-ELSE hand-coded logic tells it to -- ""*you need to keep in the center of the lane!*"" so it splits the huge lane, which is stupid and nothing a human would ever do, and is frankly unsafe.

Now ... v11 is *way better* at this than it used to be, but it still makes this mistake regularly enough - at least for me.  Why?  Because the hard-coded logic has a rough order of rules.  First - ""*keep car inbetween lane lines...*"" but then they have to build in exception after exception after exception - ""...*unless there is an entrance ramp coming in from the right in which case keep a reasonable distance off of the left line.""* etc. etc. over and over again.  And you just can't code out all the edge cases by hand.

So neural nets will *hopefully* be the answer.  Neural nets will look at all the driving and say ""*well, the right lane line moved wayyyyyy out, but the humans never move towards it so I won't either*"" and just keep on its merry way.

I do not think v12 out-of-the-box will be ""Robotaxi ready"" levels of capability.  I still question whether that's even really feasible.  But I do think that v12 has a chance in the initial drop to be at least close to v11, maybe on-par, maybe slightly better.  And then the thing to watch will be how quickly it advances.  Once they know where the disengagements come, they can figure out what the net doesn't understand, find video clips of that location being handled properly, and stuff them into the training model.  It will be so unbelievably easy - based on GPS and car telemetry data for Tesla to do this.  ""Ah, v12 gets a lot of disengagements at the 4-way intersection of State &amp; Main in Anytown, US ... let's go find a bunch of non-FSD drives though that same spot, filter for the ones that look like '5-Star Uber drivers' (Elon's phrase) and stuff them into the training dataset...""

BTW, Tesla has quite a ""moat"" in this regard given their global fleet size.

If you see v12 capabilities advance *quickly* across the 2nd, 3rd, 4th wide releases -- then I think Tesla absolutely makes it back into the $1tn club (&gt;$315 a share) in 2024.  Even if Tesla has to implement something like much more stringent weather condition limitations based on the video clips they're curating.  I'd much rather have something that gets near-close to being a Robotaxi but only on clear sunny days ... than something that muddles through with moderate (but not Robotaxi levels) of competency anytime day or night.

Conversely, if the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th releases bomb ... Tesla might just be stuck here bouncing around below $1tn for quite some time.

YMMV.  Good luck with your positions.  Keep an eye on v12, forget about robotaxi or optimus for now.
