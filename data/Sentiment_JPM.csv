 I did the 3 round interview (behavioral, hackerrank, system architecture) and the behavioral went well, the architecture interview went.. okay.. but i imagine thats more for the seniors. But the HackerRank interview went bad. I did good on the code review, but then came the coding problem and I could not figure out exactly what it was asking, but I remember doing a HackerRank practice problem that looked like this one, so I was able to regurgitate the code and it worked. But they asked me to explain it and I could not. So, I'm pretty sure they thought I cheated.

I don't know whether I'm asking for advice or just venting, but it sucks. I thought I was doing great and was going to get a huge increase to my salary by working at JPMorgan. I thought I was going to be able to let my wife work part time to spend more time with our 2 year old.

This may sound like a long shot, but I wanted to reach out to see if anyone here could offer some guidance or potentially connect me with someone regarding the Program Analyst Banker role at J.P. Morgan’s Private Bank in California. I’ve recently applied and believe I’m a strong and competitive candidate for the position. I’d really appreciate the opportunity to speak with someone who’s familiar with the role, whether that’s a current or former analyst, recruiter, or private banker, to better understand what the team looks for and how to stand out in the process.

Any insight, advice, or connections would mean a lot. Thank you all in advance for your time and help. DMs are open! ",6,2,NotoriousGambler,https://www.reddit.com/r/JPMorganChase/comments/1omzup2/trying_to_break_into_the_program_banker_analyst/,1omzup2

2025-11-02 18:56:22,r/JPMorganChase,Can someone clarify single vs. partner coverage at JPM Private Bank?,"I’m trying to understand how JPM Private Bank structures client coverage, specifically the difference between single coverage and partner coverage. From what I’ve gathered, partner coverage typically starts around clients with $25M+ in investable assets, where both a Banker and an Investor cover the relationship together. Below that level, it seems like the Banker might operate in a single coverage model, handling both relationship management and investments with support from specialists.

For those in or familiar with the Executive Director role, it also seems like you negotiate a pay package upfront based on your expected book size or production, rather than relying purely on variable comp like in brokerage models. Is that accurate?

Can anyone break down how the two coverage models actually work day-to-day? Which roles fall under each (Banker, Investor, etc.)? How do compensation, workload, and career progression differ between single and partner coverage? And for those who’ve been on either side, which path tends to lead to stronger long-term opportunities within the Private Bank?

I’ve searched LinkedIn and older threads but can’t find a clear answer, so any insight from current or former JPM PB folks would be hugely appreciated.

Like I'm sorry, you like the train ride here and you don't want more time with your family ???? People are brainwashed here....it's a sickness.

Everyone here is political and fake and it's disgusting, I don't know how people are okay with just playing this game of pretend and just lying to each other and themselves. I don't even bother and keep to myself and people on my floor think I'm a freak.

A few weeks ago, I noticed a visual change in my candidate dashboard: my *Finance &amp; Ops* application turned from black to yellow, while *Front Office* stayed black.

Does anyone know if this color change could mean a pre-selection or some kind of shortlist? Or is it just a random visual update? I’m starting to get a bit anxious since interviews are already rolling out, and HR hasn’t reached out to me yet.

Previously co-head of global investment banking, Horine will now oversee the deployment of $10 billion in direct equity and venture investments into critical U.S. sectors such as defense, energy, and advanced manufacturing.

The initiative, part of JPMorgan’s broader long-term capital commitment, reflects growing collaboration between Wall Street and Washington to reinforce the country’s industrial and defense base amid intensifying global competition.

2025-10-27 18:00:27,r/stocks,JPMorgan picks Perpetua Resources for $1.5 trillion security fund first investment,"Oct 27 (Reuters) - Antimony and gold miner Perpetua Resources (PPTA.O), opens new tab is the first investment from JPMorgan Chase's (JPM.N), opens new tab $1.5 trillion investment fund for U.S. national security, a move underscoring the company's key role in producing a metal whose exports China has blocked and which is used to make bullets and other weaponry.
Under the agreement, details of which were released on Monday, JPMorgan will invest $75 million of its own funds for a nearly 3% stake in Perpetua, which is building the largest U.S. antimony mine about 138 miles (222 km) north of Boise, Idaho.

The agreement was signed on Sunday and was expected to close on Tuesday.
The bank, which holds roughly 20,000 shares of Perpetua currently, according to LSEG data, will also have the option to exercise $42 million in warrants within three years. There are no existing U.S. sources of antimony, which is also used to make solar panels, lubricants, flame retardants and other goods.
China, the world's largest antimony miner and processor, blocked exports in late 2024, causing Western manufacturers to scramble for fresh supply.

Announced earlier this month, JPMorgan's Security and Resiliency Initiative aims to offset what CEO Jamie Dimon said was the ""painfully clear"" reality ""that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals.""
""With this investment, we are supporting a company in an industry critical to national security and American resiliency, precisely the focus of our new initiative,"" said Doug Petno, co-CEO of JPMorgan's commercial and investment bank division.

The mine, backed by billionaire investor John Paulson, will supply more than 35% of America's annual antimony needs once it opens by 2028 and also produce 450,000 ounces of gold each year.
The dual revenue stream is expected to keep the project financially afloat regardless of any steps by Beijing to sway markets. The site, which is under construction as of last week, has estimated reserves of 148 million pounds of antimony and 6 million ounces of gold.

""This is all about putting America first again relative to the supply chain, in this case for critical minerals,"" said Jon Cherry, Perpetua's CEO.

AGNICO ALSO TO INVEST

In addition to the JPMorgan investment, Toronto-based gold miner Agnico Eagle (AEM.TO), opens new tab will invest $180 million in Perpetua for a 6.5% stake and help it develop its Idaho mine.
The mine was supported by both former President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump, whose administration earlier this year issued the final necessary permits.

I know JP is extremely rigorous and competitive, so I completely understand how tough it is to make it all the way. I was listed as a silver medalist for the Tech Connect program, and I’m genuinely grateful for that, though I’ve been reflecting on my interview.

I wish I had expressed better how much I’ve dedicated myself to AI and financial time series projects. I’ve built models using algorithms like Unicorn Search, A star, and advanced machine learning methods such as Softmax, ReLU, CNNs, DNNs, LSTMs, GridSearch, and Reinforcement Learning and the understanding of the algorithms than using the libraries. I’ve also applied statistical concepts like entropy, stochastic and Bayesian distributions, and linear algebra to optimize models. In logistic regression, for example, I focused on minimizing cross-entropy loss to improve classification performance. I mentioned some projects, like stock price prediction using sentiment analysis, but didn’t get the chance to share others that used more advanced concepts due to ADHD and english is not my first language that I feared to mess up my syntax by trying to explain difficult concepts to them.

During the final round, I had a lot of thoughts running through my head because of my ADHD and ended up improvising my STAR stories instead of highlighting my deeper AI and statistical experience. Even so, I gave my best effort and spoke honestly about my experience in AI software development.

I’m not upset about the result. Being a silver medalist at JP is something I’m proud of, and I’m grateful to have made it this far.

2025-10-23 02:49:42,r/stocks,Teladoc (TDOC) Earnings 10/29 -- Turnaround Incoming,"Greetings.  I've been watching Teladoc for about 9 months, time to share my findings. I made some higher buys early in the year and have averaged down to 5000 shares @ 8.50.

Teladoc is not just some leftover garbage from the pandemic.  This is a growing international company (active in 130 countries) that offers solutions across a broad range of healthcare both for providers, patients, and enterprise customers.

Telehealth and this company ARE the future. The same way streaming killed Blockbuster. The same way Amazon killed Sears.  With healthcare, it will be more like how  rideshare has affected taxis.  Legacy healthcare is going not going away and plenty of instances where in person visits are required, but there are many instances that will gravitate to telehealth.  There are already companies that can use your own smartphone camera to diagnose strep throat with around 92% accuracy.  Technological advances such as this are going to continue to move us away from a healthcare service model that has not changed much in the last ~75 years.

Telehealth can reduce unnecessary ER visits and do it at a lower cost to patients and insurers.  Healthcare costs in the US are out of control and telehealth is continually looked at as an option to reduce costs of service.  Medicare &amp; Medicaid are expected to continue utilizing telehealth. COVID Era Telehealth provisions have already been extended twice.  That portion of the bill to re-open the government has bipartisan support.  Healthcare costs and specifically insurance premiums are going to be a huge focus of discussion in the next month.  Telehealth will be a part of that discussion.

Share Price $8.30

TDOC Annual Sales are around $2.6 Billion.  Market cap $1.5B--Try to find another stock with over 2.5B in sales and a market cap less than 1.6B!  I don't believe there is one. TDOC has 100 Million active users across 130 countries in 40 languages.  One simple justification for a higher valuation is that you simply could not build what this company already has for 1.5B.

Free Cash Flow around $185 Million. Cash on hand is around $600M Debt is also around $600M (due in 2026 and 2027--IIRC) They retired $500M in debt with cash in Q2. They secured a $300M revolving line of credit from JPM a couple of months ago.

Golden Cross activated. 50 day MA: 8.03 200 day MA: 7.64

Short interest is ~14% of the float with ~3.5 days to cover.  Not much of a factor here.

Citron (🤮) has shared some positive releases on this stock over the last 6 months. Price targets have also been raised. Most recently was Citigroup up to $10.5.

If you've made it this far maybe you've looked at a chart.  It doesn't look good.  This stock got way ahead of itself during the pandemic. And then they wasted a HUGE sum of money to buy Livongo and their earnings have been getting smoked by goodwill write-downs ever since. Competition and churn in their online therapy division ""Betterhelp"" led the company to slight revenue decline for several quarters.  A recent acquisition, ""Uplift"" allows Betterhelp to accept insurance now.  It had previously been cash pay only and patients were not sticking to the service.  Uplift should patch the leaky bucket at Betterhelp and stop the revenue decline there. Integrated Care and Chronic care monitoring services are experiencing growth. Those segments of the business have led the charge of the turn around. They've made at least 3 all cash acquisitions in 2025. Uplift Catapult Telecare (Australia)

Additional new services coming online: --A new Employee Assistance Program, Wellbound, is launching in January 2026--(announced in July 2025).  About Wellbound: ""The new program, purpose-built for the company’s employer and health plan clients in the U.S., leverages Teladoc Health’s unmatched scale, clinical product portfolio and consumer engagement expertise to help organizations create a powerful “on-ramp” for long-term employee wellness."" -- Virtual Sitter and Clarity -- AI solutions for in patient monitoring and healthcare worker safety.  Clarity is new, focused on protecting healthcare workers from Violence.  This definitely means they are going to say ""AI"" on the 10/29 earnings call, so it HAS to go up, right?

Something to keep an eye on: There have been rumors that the UK's NHS is planning to re-vamp/launch a country-wide online health/hospital service.  They will be partnering with existing telehealth companies to provide this service.  It is not yet announced which companies they will use for this though.

Positions: 5000 shares at $8.50 50 contracts X dates from November 21 2025 to Jan 2027 from at various strikes from $7.5-10.

Earnings call on 10/29 should show continued turnaround. Hopefully picking up the pace.

Last night I had a horrible nightmare about being chased by a psychopath, and I woke up terrified and exhausted. I told my manager I’d work from home today. I rarely use my WFH days anymore because of all the pointless rules, but I just couldn’t face the office.

At home, I felt peace for the first time in weeks. My home office, filled with plants and color, feels calm and inspiring. I wore comfy clothes, got my work done, and even took a break to make breakfast for my husband. I let the dogs play in the yard, went to the gym, and worked extra hours without worrying about traffic.

By the end of the day, I had enough energy to cook dinner—a hobby I’ve abandoned since returning to the office. Sitting at the table with my husband over a home-cooked meal, I realized something simple but important: I was finally productive and happy.

I love my job, my boss, and my team—but working from the office is draining the life out of me. It’s taking away the small joys that once made me feel like myself. I don’t want to lose that person to exhaustion and rules that make no sense. I just want to work, live, and feel human again. BUT I KNOW! They don't fucking care about us! to them, we’re just numbers on a screen. Replaceable. Forgettable.

**My contract says**, ""Rotations are the cornerstone of the Full-time Analyst experience, so you must fulfill all required rotations and complete the rotational experience before rolling off of the program. Only after successfully completing your rotations, will you be considered for full-time placement opportunities within the firm. The goal of the program is to prepare you for, and support you in, your career at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.. If for any reason, however, you are not in a part- or full-time equivalent and/or non-rotating position within JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. at the end of the Program or you do not accept a placement within the firm, your employment may terminate and you will not be entitled to severance or related benefits under our severance program"" 

**When asking the recruiter for clarification they said:** 

1. Placement in the Full-Time program can be across any of our lines of business. The ones listed in the offer letter are the lines of businesses we have at the firm. For placement, before you begin, you will be asked what line of business you prefer, and we try to align you best to what you are interested in. After the first rotation, we want you to gain experience in different areas of the firm within Audit and will be placed in a different line of business. Our program manager is very transparent about the process and takes your opinion into consideration. 

  
Ideally I would want to end up in Asset Management or Wealth Management. I know the Internal Audit program does work in those lines on a rotation **but I want to get out of audit. Is that realistic?** 

I also **already have an offer at KPMG for Audit (87k)** but I do not want to get my CPA and technically would have to go back to school to finish the audit classes. I have also heard that KPMG doesn't actually check if you're CPA eligible the first year.

2025-10-14 12:11:09,r/JPMorganChase,JPMorgan to Invest $10 Billion in U.S. National Security as Part of $1.5 Trillion Pledge,"JPMorgan Chase will channel $10 billion into U.S. companies tied to defense, energy, manufacturing, and other national security sectors as part of a 10-year, $1.5 trillion initiative to strengthen economic resilience. The bank plans to hire more bankers and deploy capital through direct equity and venture investments, targeting firms critical to America’s industrial and supply-chain independence. 

CEO Jamie Dimon emphasized the initiative is “100% commercial, not political,” amid heightened focus on reducing foreign dependencies in areas such as semiconductors, clean energy, and rare earth minerals. The effort aligns with broader U.S. goals to modernize domestic production and infrastructure, with Dimon noting it has become “painfully clear” that the country is too reliant on unreliable foreign sources for essential materials and manufacturing.

Don’t get me wrong, I learnt a lot, the culture was great, but always felt I had to go over and beyond to get any opportunities. I felt under valued and unappreciated (defo was). 

I knew a lot of people in the office and had built a good network of people - spent 2 years trying to find something via the internal mobility route, but nothing ever came (I put in a lot of effort). 

My team were unambitious and I was not learning anything new. I genuinely felt the team was not respected at all. However, they were very nice people. 

I felt disrespected at times also as I had to fight for promotion when all my peers were given it and some other stuff. When I finally got a promotion, the raise and bonus I received was less than I got the year before (it was a record breaking profit year, whilst the year before was a loss). To further this, during my last day I did not even get a card or a proper good bye (they do it often for others and did one literally 2 days before my final day). 

Anyway, I’m happy I’ve found somewhere new, where I am doing what Il be enjoying (I hope). Going to miss JPM and very grateful for the opportunities I’ve had. But this year post the 5 days a week announcement , the morale has changed for the worse and I’m just glad to be leaving.

I’m in a major city currently in the operation side of things in tech &amp; I am in my third round to support someone at JPMC (private client) who honestly seems great. We clicked immediately &amp; I could see myself supporting him. I definitely know I am a top pick based on how quickly I got a third interview (within 2 hours) after meeting him. 

What’s also nice is I’d be getting about a $15k-$20k pay bump…something I know I won’t get where I currently am.

I guess my question is, (minus the expected corporate greed) is this company really that bad? Is there a stark difference between the main part of company and the private clients? Is there anyone here that can speak on work/life balance on the non-financial side of things? 

What about benefits? I’m a single (non-married) woman with no kids at this time. 

I know I can ask these questions to the recruiter but I want real-life answers, not corporate ones.

Thoughts?

Update - Apologies for not including snippets of the article. Below**

‘

JPMorgan Chase has told staff moving into the US bank’s new multibillion-dollar Manhattan headquarters they must share their biometric data to access the building, overriding a prior plan for voluntary enrolment. 

Employees who have started work at its 270 Park Avenue skyscraper since August have received emails saying biometric access is “required”, according to a communication seen by the Financial Times. This allows people to scan their fingerprints or eye instead of ID badges to get through the lobby security gates.

I submitted an updated resume for the full-time application that left out one experience from my resume provided in the internship application due to missing tax forms (it was a cash job).

The internship onboarding didn't verify employment history so it wasn't a concern before. However, the full time role background check verifies degree and work experience.

For my full-time onboarding, will JPMC check my internship resume for consistency with BIG form, or only the current resume I submitted for the full-time position? I am not sure what to do.

My offer was for a React Dev(Python/Java) role and was supposed to involve me working with internal tools. Got the offer, submitted the background check forms, took i9 and fingerprint just to get a call 2 weeks in that my credit report wasn't up to par and to submit an LOE for why it's the way it is. They didn't think the LOE sufficed so they rescinded the offer. Mind you it was 5 days onsite for 135k base salary and 15k bonus (150k total). Luckily I am still working my remote 115k job, but I did want to join JPMC for the pay bump and added big bank on my resume. Sucks that credit was the one thing that screwed me. I've never done such a thorough background check with a company before so this took me by surprise. I have 5 YOE and I know going forward that I must either fix credit before applying to major banks for SWE roles, or just go to other industries where background checks are simple criminal history checks.

While emphasizing that JPMorgan is well-positioned to weather any downturn, Dimon said he’s not taking recession risks off the table, citing uncertainties around tariffs, geopolitics, the labor market, and whether AI will deliver the productivity gains investors expect. His outlook contrasts with Wall Street’s growing confidence and indicators like the Sahm Rule, which show minimal near-term recession risk. Dimon also criticized Washington’s ongoing government shutdown as “a bad idea,” arguing it creates unnecessary instability, even if its economic impact is likely limited.

1. What’s a realistic **base salary range** (low to high) for this level?
2. How is the **annual bonus** typically structured? JPMorgan doesn’t seem to have a fixed % of base salary, so how is it determined in practice?
3. Are **RSUs or stock awards** typically included in the initial offer, or are they only given after the first year / through refresh cycles?

They were confident it would be on the table by year-end, noting that I mainly needed more visibility with senior stakeholders, which they said would come through project opportunities later in the year.

Those opportunities never materialised, despite my consistent check-ins and requests for clarity on how and when they might.

In a recent 1:1, I was told the promotion wouldn’t be going ahead, as I hadn’t gained enough exposure. It was then suggested that I could build that exposure next year by organising things like a cross-department quiz or team night out….???

I asked if there were any concerns at all about my skills or performance for a 602 level, and was told absolutely not, and that I’m already performing at a 602 level, just lacking visibility.

If I’m operating at the next level and meeting expectations from a skillset and delivery perspective, it’s kind of annoying to hear that something as unrelated as organising a quiz has determined my progression. And now I have to wait at least another year.

2025-10-03 19:48:31,r/JPMorganChase,I declined an offer from JPM in NYC,"I also wrote an interview review about this on Glassdoor but to summarize, after a 3 month process and 4 rounds of remote interviews, I was offered a Product Manager (VP) role in NYC (237 Park) which I declined for a few reasons:

1. I told the HR Recruiter from the beginning of the process that I had personal arrangements to take care of during the evening and usually left the office around 3:30pm when I went in, currently 1 day a week in my current job and what would be 5 days a week at JPM which I was okay with. That communication never got discussed between HR and the Hiring Manager during the process so when I brought it up again during the offer conversations to confirm on it, I got told it wasn't possible (even though I work in Tech now and am always reachable by mobile or remotely) and that any exception I would try to raise would be rejected at that point. The RTO policy in JPM is so inherently vague that other than being ""5 days a week"", hours corresponding to your work-life balance vary widely depending on your team. As much as I tried to pull information out of HR regarding the specifics (ie. 8 hours in-office being required every day and being tracked) in order to figure out how much time I would losing in leaving a hybrid (mostly remote) role for this (they wanted me in the office from 8am to 5:30pm and only told me this after the offer was presented when I asked again), it felt like every answer was purposely not answering the question.
2. During the interview process, I was given varying statements, depending on the interviewer, regarding the correct rank of the role compared to the responsibilities. At points that I did not even bring up on the interviews, two separate people suggested it as being an ED role rather than VP given the oversight that would be performed over other teams, a point I agreed with. When I brought this up to the HR Recruiter, I was told on both occasions that the interviewer should not have brought that topic up for discussion and that the role was as-is with no further discussion. This made me feel like some responsibilities were being hidden purposely before someone joined the team.
3. The offer that I was presented with did not meet my base pay expectations that I had made clear to the HR Recruiter from the first time they called me. I was told at the time of the offer presentation that I was not allowed to counter because the offer was already the highest they would go, even though it was not at the top of the advertised range and my base pay requirement was not the top number. This made me feel like I was being backed into a corner with the offer being presented, even if it was slightly higher than I was making now and had a guaranteed bonus for the first year.

Overall, I feel like if some of these points had just been disclosed at the beginning, it wouldn't have taken up as much of my time or JPM's time, even if I did get additional interview experience out of it. I also feel that this RTO policy is leaving a lot of valuable talent off the table for those who work in other financial institutions and can bring years of experience to newer teams/projects. JPM has name recognition but if you have regularly-occurring obligations outside of work, it felt like the mental/physical toll those obligations require is being left behind by JPM.",172,20,OkMeasurement1305,https://www.reddit.com/r/JPMorganChase/comments/1nx61yl/i_declined_an_offer_from_jpm_in_nyc/,1nx61yl

I’m currently an associate in a risk/middle office role and considering to move into front office (sales &amp; trading) at some point. Recently, there’s been talk about me potentially being promoted to VP in my current team.

On one hand, a promotion is always a recognition of hard work and could help my career progression. On the other hand, I’m concerned it might actually make it harder to pivot into front office, since I’d then be seen as more senior in risk, rather than someone who can make a lateral move into S&amp;T.

WeRide’s whole thesis is scaling Level-4 autonomous taxis/shuttles worldwide, with major partnerships and pilots on 4 continents:

* **Middle East (Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, Dubai)**: Largest public AV fleets outside the US/China. Tripled Abu Dhabi fleet, first Saudi L4 taxi permit, rides linked with Uber. Middle East fleet aims for 1,000 vehicles by 2030.
* **China (Shanghai)**: Launched L4 robotaxis with Chery Group and Jinjiang taxi firm; co-developed new EV “CER” model.
* **Southeast Asia (Singapore)**: Grab invested in WeRide; first fully driverless robotaxi service planned with thousands of AVs in SEA.
* **Europe (France, Belgium)**: Partnered with Renault for L4 robo-shuttles, pilot programs in Belgium and France.
* **Tech**: HPC 3.0 computing unit cuts AV compute cost \~50%, giving WeRide an edge.
* **Permits**: Holds L4 AV licenses in 7 markets (China, UAE, Singapore, France, Saudi, Belgium, US), more than any peer.

# Key Metrics &amp; Valuation

* Market Cap: \~$2.9B.
* FY2024 Revenue: \~$50.2M; 2Q’25 alone $17.8M.
* Ownership: Founders hold \~4.8% each; corporate backers include SoftBank/Alliance Ventures and Zhengzhou Yutong. Top 25 holders own \~44%.
* Profitability: Unprofitable (2Q’25 net loss \~RMB406M), EPS deeply negative. Cash burn focused on R&amp;D and expansion.
* Guidance: Ambition to scale to “thousands” of robo-vehicles by 2026.
* Analyst Outlook: Average 12-month price target \~$16.3, reflecting strong confidence in growth.

# Recent News &amp; Catalysts

* **Belgium L4 Permit**: First-ever Belgian Level-4 test license for EZ10 Robobus in Leuven.
* **Dubai License**: Robotaxi trial permit; initial 50 GXR robotaxis, scaling to \~1,000 vehicles.
* **Grab Investment**: Strategic equity investment; L4 robotaxis to deploy across Southeast Asia.
* **Index &amp; PR Wins**: Added to Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index; featured on Fortune’s 2025 Change the World list.
* **Saudi Launch**: First public robotaxi pilot in Riyadh with Uber.

**What to watch next:**

* Revenue growth in Robotaxi business.
* New regulatory permits
* Partnerships with the big guys (Uber, NVDA)
* Buybacks

**Bottom line:** While there are valuation concerns due to high multiples, WeRide is unprofitable **but** growing explosively. The Q2 beat, positive analyst coverage, and pipeline of high-profile deployments make a bullish thesis. With a \~$2.9B market cap and small revenue base, the unique global footprint – 30+ cities, dozens of AV permits, and strong industry backing, I see massive growth potential. Catalysts like EU/ME rollouts, index inclusion, and continued robotaxi scaling could drive the stock if execution stays on track.",28,10,MirageMantra,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntm28y/weride_wrd_bet_on_robotaxis_dd/,1ntm28y

I joined Chase as a 502 mainly to get my foot in the door, expecting to climb the ladder quickly since I have a related degree and around 9 years of experience. I’ve been with my current team for over a year now and have been trying internal mobility, but haven’t had much success yet.

Last week, I saw a 602 opening that I meet all the requirements for, so I applied and reached out to the hiring manager to evaluate me. After 3–4 days, the HM replied that since I’m currently a 502, I’m not eligible for 602. They also mentioned that they would reach out if anything opens up at 502 or 601 level in their team.

Is there any official policy or rule at Chase that prevents a 502 from being considered for a 602? I’d love to hear from anyone who has navigated internal mobility or promotions from 502 to 602.

2025-09-28 01:48:00,r/JPMorganChase,Let's think critically about the H1-B visa thing.,"It's easy to jump to conclusions about the impact of this fee increase. Naively, one might expect it to work like a protective tariff, but as a tax it's important to understand this in a historical context, and also an economic one. What does history show about H1-Bs? Who bears the burden of this tax, as well as the complements and supplements in production of H1-B visas and the other options companies have rather than paying the tax.

**Historically,** H1 visas go back to the 50s. For generations, then, companies have been importing highly-skilled labor to fill positions *on the claim* that sufficient local labor was not available. For sure in the 90s, (for this author experienced it) there was a wave of concern that companies would use the program solely to drive down American developer wages. The concern may have been valid, but it did eventually peter out. Perhaps the dot-com bubble distracted people? Perhaps the many other high-profile historical events did that job? In any case, it's on the agenda again today, 30 years later. In that amount of time, companies *have not* in fact sent all the jobs overseas. *They've sent a lot of them,* but by the same token the total number of programmers world-wide has grown exponentially. As a proportion of the American population, our profession is probably doing just fine.

**Economically,** when the company lays people off at the same time as making H1-B applications, it's hard to come to any other conclusion than it's a cost-saving measure. But again naively, an H1-B visa-holder could equally do work in their home country, and generally for far less money and under worse conditions. There are tech centers in India and many Asian cities. The companies *choose to import labor* and pay the associated premiums. There may be some elasticity to that demand, but it won't go away completely even at these prices.

So why bring people to America? What special thing does an H1-B visa-holder offer the company *only* by being physically present in the USA?

One theory is **visibility to the work force.** The immigrant labor necessarily serves as *an advertisement* to the locals, *reminding* them of the company's alleged power to ship jobs overseas. This no doubt drives down American wages far more in the aggregate than the additional cost of bringing a few people from a low-cost country to a high-cost one. The extra $100,000 does not really make a dent. And let's don't forget that the visa is good for three years, extensible to six: Annualized, this fee is peanuts compared to the *shareholder value* of paying it. So that's the stick. But there's also a carrot: The *mere prospect* of an H1-B visa is held out as a reward for the most loyal, highest-performing among the foreign tech centers. By paying *just a few people* a slightly larger share of their value to the company, they get more work out of everyone. It's almost as good as the bondage that the visa itself creates.

Some sources indicate the administration is reserving the **right to make exceptions** for people, industries, and companies from the new fees. Is that an invitation to bribery? Multiply the H1-B population at your employer by 100k, and see if the company might be tempted to make some kind of *offer in compromise* that greases just the right palms. That's bad, of course, but does it get people fired up about the right things?

In point of fact, it's a problem that tech workers in India and other places are paid as little as they are, and worked as long and as hard as they are. The visas may be getting a lot of press right now, but they're ultimately a side show.

To whatever extent H1-B visas go away, it will create conditions for Indians and Asians to demand better pay and working conditions. It will stop the most respected and influential among them from poached away from the people they're most able to organize and sent into a place where they're most afraid to do so. Let us support the idea of getting tech centers in India and Asia properly organized under a union banner! (Yes, Indian law protects the right to form a union.) Doing so will do more good for more people than any controversy over visas ever would.

Let me conclude: The H1-B visa thing is a good reason to pull out the popcorn and watch the fireworks, but it won't change anything in practice for the average worker any time soon. It may, however, yield up more good opportunities for rich, powerful men to heap shame upon themselves and their works.

2025-09-27 02:58:41,r/JPMorganChase,Got up leveled from Lead Engineer to Sr Lead,"So I interviewed for a position out of the NY Midtown office for a Lead Software Engineer. I got a call from the recruiter that they are extending the offer to me. I said great, but my minimum expectation for base pay is 215k (which happens to be the max pay range of the position I applied for). The recruiter said there’s no way they would onboard me at the max pay of the position I applied for, so they would consider up-leveling me to the next title of Lead. 

Later that day, I had a call, and the recruiter said the comp team agreed to bump me to the next level to Sr Lead SE(without me doing any other interviews lol), which supports the base pay of 215k I’m looking for, and they will extend that offer. Additionally, the recruiter claims I will be entitled to a bonus at the end of the year somewhere around 15-20k. And my full bonus for next year would be around 50k. I’m looking for advice if this is a good offer to consider. Specifically, because will I be bumped into a new role with higher expectations for the same pay, or was this bump just a way for them to justify the compensation to the budget committee? I’m currently in a hybrid 3-day-a-week at my current company, so moving to a full RTO means I expect top pay. I have almost 10 years of experience. 

The good thing is I went from a Lead Software Engineer to a Sr Lead without having to do anything.

2025-09-26 10:43:59,r/JPMorganChase,My GF’s manager keeps pushing extra hours without comp-offs – is this normal?,"Hi everyone,
My girlfriend has been working under her manager for a few months now, and I’m a bit concerned about the way he handles work.

Some examples:

He has said things like “I can’t ask you not to take leaves, but it’ll be great if you stay and work”.

Another time: “No one’s going home today until this is done”.

He’s even mentioned “We’ve got to work this weekend and maybe the upcoming holiday too”.


The issue isn’t occasional crunch work—it’s that this has happened multiple times in just a few months. She and her team often end up working 5+ hours on weekends, late nights, and holidays, but there’s no clarity on paid time off or comp-off. In fact, whenever someone raises the idea, the manager tends to brush it aside or guilt-trip them to the point they feel bad even asking.

To me, it feels less like genuine teamwork and more like gaslighting. On top of that, he sometimes casually texts late at night or early morning asking if deployments can be done right away. The lack of planning/coordination seems to keep pushing the team into last-minute crunches.

I’ve worked at a different company where we had long hours too, but good bonding and fair recognition made it worthwhile. Here, it feels one-sided.

TL;DR: GF’s manager keeps pressuring team to work late nights, weekends, and holidays without proper comp-off or recognition, often guilt-tripping them if they ask.

\-Polaris Parkway, Columbus, Ohio **doesn't have a bus system** for staff going work. It's a flat land with over 15,000 cars coming in. You will struggle. For new hires, you think you can pool car, it's not easy. Amazon and Microsoft have staff buses, a Vanpool option, dedicated Slack channels for employees who live in close proximity, etc., but that's not the case in Polaris Parkway. 

\-You have the **option of taking three months before relocating**. Take the full length, and even ask for more time, if needed. You'd need a good laptop. Chase doesn't have computers at work. You use your laptop and a virtual desktop that can be frustrating. You get $750 for two years for mouse, monitor, laptop or whatever. However, most people use that for two monitors to replicate the setup at work, at their homes (two-three screens). When you start remotely before moving, you are able to get approved for car loans, buy a good laptop (with good RAM), and better prepare.

2025-09-24 16:30:27,r/JPMorganChase,No Follow-up after interview,"From what I’ve seen in several posts here, it looks like JPMorgan may have implemented a hiring freeze for certain positions over the past few weeks. I applied for a corporate role in June and was contacted by a recruiter within a week to set up a first-round interview, which I completed in mid-July. During the interview, the panel mentioned that the recruiter would follow up regarding next steps, but also advised me to be patient with the process. It’s now been about two months, and I haven’t received any updates, though my application status still shows “Under Consideration.” Since then, I’ve also applied to two other positions at JPMorgan but was not selected to move forward.

2025-09-24 05:10:28,r/JPMorganChase,"Explaining the overall mental turmoil of the overall economy (including labor, job and inflation) to my classist and ableist father who is an executive for JP.Morgan","Hi. So I am currently trying to explain the future of the economy for new grads with the way the U.S is heading especially since I got laid off because of tariffs in the manufacturing industry (on the corporation side mind you) I also have autism and its not the one that I need constant accommodations I just need more time to process and handle information especially if it doesn’t make sense, but if it makes sense, to the point and out of good faith, I will get it done within 10 minutes what would probably take an hour, but it doesn’t seem companies want to make sense anymore but nonetheless.

 I try to explain that the job market is not great and I can’t even get internships in my psychology field because no one is hiring and or limited funding which is only reserved for students who financially need it. My dad said there’s job out there I just have to be “marketable” still trying to figure out what that means because I went interview workshops and  resume building workshops and had my resume edited only so AI bots can scan keywords they can make me “standout”. 

He also claims thst JP Morgan have neurodivergent employees so if anyone that is: How are you treated? Do you have to mask at all? Is it somewhere for a Neurodivergent to work? 

He also claims that college interns when they graduated are automatically granted offers to be work as a JP Morgan employee is that accurate. 

But here’s the thing when I ask him how come people can’t get jobs or hold on to it because of the unpredictability (like I saw one that got laid off under 2 weeks for no reason a few post down) he says well they are just spreading external noise and they probably did something that got them fired and they leave a bad review to taint their reputation and while I can see that as a possibility but if enough people are voicing the similar concerns or worse there’s a revolving door in the positions, is it really the person or the position. But also I’m still trying to navigate these barriers that isn’t built for a neurodivergent college student like myself. But I also understand while yes my father has climbed the ladder to his position at JP Morgan it just doesn’t work for me and I’m feeling like I’m letting him down. 

But I don’t know it’s really a rant but also to see what is JP Morgan really like mentality wise. Also I don’t want him to get identified since he is high on that JP Morgan ladder (especially if it’s controversial/political but if anyone knows the position where he is vice president/chairman of operations in the state we reside that’s his role along with 3 board of directors seats.)

2025-09-20 22:44:53,r/JPMorganChase,What special joy was your experience of EAW?,"*It was a very nice duffel bag.*

How was the town-hall? Did it make you feel appreciated? Are we sold on the virtues of RTO yet? What was that bit about Democrats?

We took a short survey of people from across the company: What would make them feel truly appreciated? We heard from many types of employees in many locations. Here are some of the things they said:

Respect and Recognition:

* Trust and respect - as a human being, an adult, and a professional.
* Public recognition of, and credit for, good performance.
* Hey Boss: Stop making empty promises!
* Reaffirm the importance of strong, vibrant DEI programs.

Everyday Conditions:

* End hot-desks: Let us personalize our own dedicated work spaces.
* Natural lighting.
* Nightly cleaning / vacuum / wipe-down of all desks and common areas.
* Fix the recent parking and traffic congestion: Problems that RTO created!

Fair Pay and Security:

* Wages that let me live in comfort, not merely get by.
* Yearly raises and bonuses that track with company profits.
* Meaningful bonus structure (a.k.a. incentive compensation).
* Better retirement benefits: either bring back pension plans or increase 401k matching.
* Eliminate sudden relocation ultimatums (move-or-quit orders).

Healthy Work and Life:

* End the cycle of manufactured urgency and fake deadlines.
* Return to hybrid and remote work: It's good for the bottom line.
* Fulfilling work-life balance.
* Availability of, and ability to enjoy, healthy food and exercise at the workplace.
* High-end ergonomic peripherals kept working well, for all workers by default.
* Actually approve sensible FWA (Flexible Working Arrangement) requests.
* More time off, and especially comp-time after a particularly long shift or week-end work.
* Paid family-leave on par with developed countries.
* The four-day work-week.



What are your favorites? What would you add to this list? What do your colleagues and friends at work think?

If you'd like to build worker power and agitate for change, then come to our meetings. In partnership with the CWA and the Committee for Better Banks, we'll get you trained up in how to exercise workplace rights you may not know about, build a collective bargaining unit, gain more rights, and eventually a contract that establishes fair, mutually agreeable standards of work and pay. *None of this is easy,* or we would all already have it. *But it's worth the effort. It can be fun, and there are miniature victories along the way.*

Most union drives take years to fully gestate. **Wells Fargo Workers United**'s has been developing for several years now, but they are making meaningful progress. There are rules you should know, to stay out of trouble, but **you cannot be fired** ***for organizing per se****.*

**If you'd like to help, you know how to reach us.** Whether you're a social butterfly or a wallflower, we can put your skills toward the cause. But whatever else you do, *do not wait until you think your job is in danger!* By that time, it may be too late. We are not a last-ditch lifeline. We want to create the circumstances so that people *do not need* a lifeline because they already have the safety and security and health and comfort that make for a great place to work.",82,9,JPMCWorkers,https://www.reddit.com/r/JPMorganChase/comments/1nm932f/what_special_joy_was_your_experience_of_eaw/,1nm932f

I just want to ask if anyone here has experienced being tagged as AWOL in their previous job but still managed to get employed and continue working with JP Morgan.

Here’s my situation: I recently discovered (only now, while checking my old emails) that my previous company issued a **Notice of Decision** tagging me as AWOL back in 2022. The thing is, I had already resigned properly — I submitted my resignation to my supervisor, responded to HR’s admin hearing invite confirming my resignation, and even completed my clearance, got my **final pay**, and received my **COE**. Despite that, HR still issued an AWOL notice without following up with me or my supervisor.

I’ve already reached out to HR from my previous company, and they confirmed they recall the overstaffing/reprofiling situation at that time and assured me they’ll resolve it. I’ve also informed HR at JP Morgan for transparency.

Now I’m just wondering — has anyone else here gone through something similar (being tagged AWOL in your previous job), but it didn’t affect your employment with JP Morgan? I’m really hoping this won’t become a big issue since I acted in good faith and resigned properly.

I’m a 3rd year CSE student from a tier-3 college. I thought I had decent coding skills and was doing okay, but just faced my first placement failure and it hit me hard.

I took part in **JPMC Code for Good** (June 28–29). Our project even became runner-up. But here’s the thing — I literally built the whole project myself (100% commits in repo, gave the presentation, everything). Still, **all of my teammates except me who had 0 commits got selected for the internship**, and I didn’t.

I honestly don’t know how to take this. Feels super unfair and I’m losing confidence. I don’t want this to break me but right now I feel done.

Has anyone else gone through something like this? How did you handle it and move forward? Any tips to keep myself motivated for upcoming placements would mean a lot 🙏",28,20,VCReddy02,https://www.reddit.com/r/JPMorganChase/comments/1nfqt6x/jpmc_cfg_is_scamfirst_placement_failure_feeling/,1nfqt6x

I’ve been hired by JPMorgan for the Glasgow office as a senior associate software engineer and my start date is next month. However, I’m really interested in joining the London office instead.

Do you think it’s worth reaching out to my HR recruiter to discuss this possibility? My interviewers were all from the Glasgow team, so I’m not sure how much flexibility there would be at this stage.

Has anyone here gone through something similar or knows the best way to approach moving from Glasgow to the London office—either before starting or after joining?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

2025-09-09 07:20:54,r/JPMorganChase,“How J.P. Morgan Enabled the Crimes of Jeffrey Epstein”,"This is an incredibly long article, and I have to say I’m shocked. Long story short - they knew. 

They explicitly continued the relationship with him after he got in trouble in FL. They asked the q a lot, “Should we be doing to business with someone like this?” They kept at it. 

Alarms were going off in AML. Execs told Epstein about that and he changed his methods. 

Jes Staley, seen as the successor to Jamie in the 2000s, early 2010s was Epstein’s main guy at the bank. He had sex with one of Epstein girls (not an underage one) in NYC. Constantly defended him. Was close personal friends. 

They opened accounts in Epstein’s girls names at his direction without ever having met the girls. The story mentions one of the girls SSN didn’t even work. They opened anyway. 

Mary Erdoes….I’m not sure how this person is still employed at the bank. She knew it all and was deeply involved. Really sick stuff. Was the one who ended the relationship with Epstein, in person, at his house.

Jamie Dimon claimed under oath he never even heard of the guy until 2019. Epstein was a major figure with celebrities and governments alike for about 20 years at this point. Additionally, he was one of the biggest clients at JPM. Zero chance Dimon hadn’t even heard his name before 2019. What a fucking disgusting liar. (Similar to how he lies about how he can’t get anyone to answer his phone calls on a Friday in a hybrid world….scumbag.) 

There’s a lot more in the story. I’m just sort of blown away by the corruption here. And no one held accountable. At all.

Wanted a quick opinion on my situation.

I attended an interview at JPMC: my first round was with a director a while back. After that, I got a call and did a quick discussion on the spot (top-up talk, etc.).

Then I didn’t hear anything for a while and assumed I might’ve been rejected. But later, I got a call from HR for a final F2F interview (super day). The interview included English and math questions, which I completed, and the manager took my interview. It went well—they even asked about my salary expectations and noted something on my resume. When leaving, they said I’d get a call in 1–2 weeks.

It’s been quite some time now, and I haven’t received any updates. I followed up with HR, and they replied:

“We are currently awaiting feedback from the hiring manager and will update you as soon as we receive it. We kindly ask for your patience as we work on this.”

I’m just curious—has anyone else experienced this long wait after a super day, or is it just me getting ghosted? 😅",7,4,armin_1999,https://www.reddit.com/r/JPMorganChase/comments/1nc5lpv/jpmc_super_day_interview_waiting_for_hr_feedback/,1nc5lpv

2025-09-08 15:54:11,r/JPMorganChase,RTO logic: spend 600 hours a year commuting… to sit on Zoom,"So apparently “return to office” really means *return to traffic*.

* I spend 2+ hours a day commuting. That’s 600 hours a year - aka 15 full work weeks - just to sit on Zoom calls I could’ve done from home.
* I had a 1:1 with my manager on Zoom… while he was sitting one foot away from me. Peak innovation.
* Oh, and I’m not even allowed to go to a building closer to me. Nope, gotta haul myself across Tampa traffic to THE building. Because, Management wants everyone to be seated together. 

Now they’re telling us we need a blanket 8 hours in office. Tried it. Absolutely no outside life. Between beating school traffic, dropping off/picking up my son, and sitting in my car most mornings and evenings, my life is basically traffic reports and road rage.

When I do make it into the office? I’m:

* Playing musical chairs hoping to find a seat.
* Re-adjusting monitors every damn day.
* Drowning in noise.
* And by lunch, already obsessively checking Google Maps so I don’t end up rotting on the interstate until 7 PM.

I like my actual job. I hate this clown show setup that makes me less productive, more stressed, and basically steals any shot at work-life balance.

But hey, at least leadership can say “look at all the butts in seats.” Productivity! 

Sorry about another rant on RTO!! It took me 1.5 hours to get to work today even after leaving at 6:30 AM… and it breaks my heart every day that I don’t even get to see my son until evening since he wakes up after I’m already gone.

No significant movements are occurring. Jeremy enthusiastically revisits the diamond pattern, anticipating a breakout soon. With jobs data due tomorrow, a substantial market move is expected. Jeremy shares a strategy tip: identify the day's biggest losers, such as $NEON, which dropped 80% this morning. Investigate sudden selloffs; if no clear reason is found, the stock may be oversold.  
  
[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KBWOkZshFw&amp;t=270s) – [11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KBWOkZshFw&amp;t=690s) — Introduction: Patrick introduces Gary Kaltbaum, who dives straight into his bullish market perspective. He highlights well-known stocks like $JPM, $HOOD, $NVDA, $META, and $AMZN, noting they’re at their 50-day moving averages and poised for a breakout. Gary observes that institutions are heavily investing, signaling a strong bullish trend, despite some analysts predicting a market collapse.

Gary emphasizes that valuations are reasonable, with some overvalued stocks correcting to fair value. He advises caution against chasing overhyped IPOs, which often debut overpriced, but maintains an overall bullish market outlook.

Gary agrees, describing himself as blending Bill O’Neil’s breakout-spotting skills with Stan Weinstein’s ability to identify bottoms. He highlights the homebuilder sector’s shift from bearish to bullish, with $XHB leading the charge in emerging market trends.

The discussion shifts to political influences on the market, with the group emphasizing the importance of staying informed about policy changes. They note that administrations often provide straightforward insights into market dynamics.  
  
[24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KBWOkZshFw&amp;t=1470s) – [28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KBWOkZshFw&amp;t=1710s) — The Bond Market: Matthew steers the conversation to bonds, prompting Gary’s input. The consensus is that the bond market has stabilized. However, if the yield curve approaches 5–6%, a reassessment of market positions may be necessary. For now, the outlook remains positive. They advise monitoring $JPM closely, as a bearish turn in $JPM could signal a broader market shift.  
  
[28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KBWOkZshFw&amp;t=1710s) – [33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KBWOkZshFw&amp;t=2010s) — The Softs: Gary discusses overvalued software companies that have entered bearish trends. He recommends watching for capital rotation and identifying where money is flowing during such shifts.

Gary responds firmly, stating he never lets losses reach that level. Jeremy agrees, stressing the importance of quickly cutting losers and staying vigilant for warning signs. He advises focusing on market realities over negative news, emphasizing, “Trade what you see, not what you hear.” The group dismisses bear market fears, noting that negative media narratives often overshadow positive trends.

2025-09-01 13:49:56,r/JPMorganChase,Turn “They” into “We” at JPMorgan Chase,"Layoffs hurt. Stress, uncertainty, and “do more with less” hurts. And it’s easy to look at a union and think “they” should fix it.

But a union isn’t “they.” It’s us. The one lever we fully control is our numbers. The more coworkers who link up, even quietly; the more real power we have to win concrete protections.

What growth unlocks

* Small but steady support --&gt; mutual aid, credible information, documenting harms and * patterns.
* Expanding support --&gt; targeted actions that win specific fixes and build public backing.
* Majority support --&gt; formal recognition and a bargaining table for enforceable layoff processes, severance standards, transfer options, and just-cause protections.

How you can help (even silently)
* Add your name as a supporter/member; quiet participation is welcome.
* Invite 2 to 3 coworkers to a private one-on-one this week; listen first, share why you signed.
* Plug into a team (outreach, research, communications, mutual aid). Even one hour a week moves the needle.
* Help behind the scenes if you can’t go public yet: data entry, copywriting, turnout texting, meeting notes, pattern tracking.
* Share a story (anonymously) about the impact you’re seeing; stories build the case for change.

Power = people × participation. If we want bigger, faster wins, we have to grow our list, our conversations, and our active teams.

This Labor Day, join us and help turn “they” into “we.”

Let us offer a toast to all those who've spoken out against the enshittification of the job, or joined hands with colleagues to stand together in solidarity. Finally, let us workers look forward to doubling down on our commitment to altruism - to mutual aid and protection from the employer's schemes - and to greater success in the coming season.

We have great and glorious days ahead, so let us continue to fight the good fight and *WIN WITH UNION!*

2025-08-30 21:35:46,r/JPMorganChase,Please teach me about Data Science at JPMC (I'm a new hire),"Hi everyone,

  
I am new to JPMorganChase and joined as part of the Operations analyst program. I am young and am currently trying to figure out what long-term career path I wish to pursue beyond my 2-year analyst program. I think that I want to become a Data Scientist.

  
**Background Details:** I have a bachelor's in Finance and Statistics/Analytics through a reputable college. Through these college courses, I have learned R, Python, predictive modeling, training data, developing hypotheses, testing hypotheses, and the fundamentals of finance &amp; statistics. I did very well in those courses and learned that I have a genuine passion for the field of Analytics.

I spent time these past 2 weeks scoping the industry outlook and learning what is the difference between a Data Scientist and Data Analyst. I prefer Data Scientist over Data Analyst because it has a higher salary in general and I believe the role possesses a higher potential in its responsibilities long-term. I recognize that I need to upskill my software developer skills and obtain certifications/develop coding projects to make up for my lack of professional experience in Data Science.

Excluding my current role, I have had 1 full-time role post-college with another reputable company that is known for its software. I have a background in testing, process improvement, and automation projects. I have not had the opportunity to use my finance and analytics skillsets in my prior experience and will not have the opportunity to apply those skills in my current analyst role at JPMC due to the team that I'm on. Testing documents/automation/identifying process improvements are my current responsibilities.

  
**Questions:** Could anyone please share some advice about what a career path as a Data Scientist looks at JPMorganChase? I'm sure this is a very broad question, but any insights help! 

How do the opportunities differ in each LOB?

Are Data Engineering and ML skillsets replacing the standard responsibilities of Data Scientists (I saw that in r/datascience)? Should I prioritize a skillset with ML and coding?

Is being a Data Scientist truly a career path that I should pursue long-term? Or am I completely mistaken and don't know what I'm actually getting myself into?  


Where should I start learning? Code first?

I plan on staying with JPMorganChase for the long-term future because this is my dream company, but you never know what the future holds for you.

2025-08-24 22:33:06,r/JPMorganChase,Internal Transfer &amp; Right-Leveling (VP → ED),"Looking for some guidance on internal transfers and leveling.

I joined JPMC about a year ago as a Senior Manager / VP. To be honest, I didn’t do enough research at the time and I now realize I was likely down-leveled and low-balled compared to my experience and background. I took the role as-is just to get in, but in hindsight it feels like a mismatch.

For context, I’ve spent 15+ years leading data science and AI/ML teams at Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and now JPMC, delivering $600M+ in business impact and currently managing a team of 14 here. Given that scope and track record, I feel my role aligns more naturally with ED responsibilities, which is why I’m wondering if this internal move is the right moment to address the mismatch.

Now I have an offer from another team within JPMC. My question is:
	•	Can I push for a re-leveling (VP → ED) during the internal transfer process, given my experience?
	•	Has anyone here been “right-leveled” as part of a move, or is the job always locked to the current level or if I can Apply for ED level role directly in the team? 
	•	What’s the best way to raise this without jeopardizing the offer?

Appreciate any honest perspectives from those who’ve navigated this — I’d like to handle it the right way this time.

2025-08-24 20:53:24,r/JPMorganChase,My Experience Working at JPMorgan Chase – Not What I Expected,"Reposting after my post was taken down on another site.

I worked in commercial banking at JPMorgan Chase, one of the biggest and most well-known banks in the world. This is just my perspective from the division I was in — I can’t speak for every corner of such a massive firm and yes I admit, I come off like a jaded, bitter dumped ex BF. But for anyone thinking about working there, here’s what it was like.

I came in with years of experience in banking sales and in credit, and I was excited. JPM has an incredible reputation, cutting-edge technology, and a leadership team that is legendary in the industry. I thought I was joining the best of the best.

The reality? It felt like the culture was: “We’re JPMorgan Chase. Everyone wants to be here. If you’re not happy, there’s the door.” To succeed, you had to hustle constantly — chase every lead, knock on every door, live and breathe origination. That part is fair; banking is about generating business.

But here’s the irony: despite having trillions in assets, the budget for client entertainment was laughably small. I’m talking “barely enough for coffee and a bagel each month.” Hitting some of the highest goals in the industry with that kind of support felt impossible. Managers often paid for happy hours out of their own pocket just to build some team morale.

Sadly, I feel that to become the best today you need to leverage your position as a firm unfairly, to leverage it against your employees and your customers. You need to make employees put in five dollars worth of work and pay them two dollars. Some call that margin, I call that leverage. I have come to realize that the attitude at the firm is a “take it or leave it” attitude. To it’s employees, customers and clients it’s a “we don’t need you attitude, if you’re not happy, the door is right there. We are JPMC and our CEO is Jamie Dimon. Everyone wants to be here, and you will be easily replaced”. I found it was certainly the attitude of my manager. As such the bank churns through people like no other.

Work-from-home? Forget it. The expectation was long hours in the office, every day. Leaving early — even occasionally — was basically career suicide. For anyone with a long commute or a family, it was brutal. On top of that, there weren’t even enough desks or meeting rooms to go around. Sit in the wrong section, and you’d risk a passive-aggressive sticky note telling you to move.

Hey Jamie, how about I trade you your chopper, nanny, butler and grown kids for my hour and half commute on the train to see my little ones well past their bedtime every weeknight? But hey, I signed up for this and if I’m not happy  “the door is right there” at JPMC.

back to my experience....after much digression and run on statements! The pressure started immediately. New hires were regularly told they had just a couple months to deliver huge results or risk being let go. I remember hearing about one person who came back from their wedding only to be told they had “lost time to make up.” That pretty much summed it up.

I was also once told I needed to be “more like a used car salesman” if I wanted to make it there. Apparently building trust and real relationships wasn’t fast enough — shareholders wanted instant returns. Clients, meanwhile, were tired of seeing their relationship managers churn every year or two, which made building credibility nearly impossible.

Everything was stack-ranked and posted publicly, which only fueled the toxicity. I also heard repeatedly that high performers sometimes found themselves under “investigation” just before bonuses were due — while certain superstars got a pass despite questionable tactics.

When I was finally told I was done, I almost laughed with relief. Walking out of there felt like an elephant had stepped off my back. I shook my manager’s hand and honestly felt like I’d won the lottery.

If you’re considering JPMorgan Chase for the culture or work-life balance, I’d say think twice. You’ll learn a lot, and the name carries weight, but the trade-offs — at least in my corner of the bank — just weren’t worth it.

Life’s too short for a job that feels this long.

It’s a job opening at my current team that is essentially a promotion, without the tedious promotion process that takes years. I’m barely 2 yrs in so it feels like a huge step!

With jpmc, is it advisable to negotiate the offer, or do existing employees are to just accept what is given on the offer? 

Another question, when I was hired almost 2 yrs ago - i failed to ask if there is relocation assistance. I only knew this a few months in. 
Would it be advisable to ask for this now during this new offer?

2025-08-21 09:25:22,r/JPMorganChase,Anyone else doing “evening swipes” to stay compliant?,"I wanted to share something and see if anyone else is in the same boat. Over the past month or so, I’ve had to WFH on quite a few days (about 10 out of 20 working days).

The reason is personal — I’ve got a 1.5-year-old who’s quite a handful and a wife dealing with a lot of postpartum health issues. Being at home gives me a chance to step in occasionally so she can catch a breather, do some chores, or just have time for herself.

To avoid being flagged for excessive WFH, I’ve been doing what I call “evening swipes” — driving to the office in the evening, swiping in and sitting for an hour or so, then heading back. Sometimes I log in and work, sometimes I catch up on personal stuff, but the main reason is just to record my in-office presence.

I know this isn’t technically correct and it’s definitely not ideal, but I’m curious — does anyone else do this? Or know someone who does? Is this something that could get flagged or cause issues later on?

I do see quite a few entries in the late login register on the security desk but would be good to hear if your experiences and opinions and thoughts.

If I buy a separate laptop just for work, would I still have to use the annoying VDI terminal, or could I work directly from it? I know some people just use the office desktops to log into VDI, but I like having my own device with me at all times, so I’m wondering if giving IT a dedicated work laptop changes anything.

Therefore, **let us offer an impassioned plea of our own:** If you've been having trouble with your *reasonable* medical accommodation requests; if you've had your doctor's advice ignored; if you've been forced into unhealthy compromise or even forced out of the job on account of your medical condition, ***PLEASE*** **send your story to our gmail address!** The username is `jpmcWorkers`. One of our JPMC worker will respond either to acknowledge or ask clarifying questions.

2025-08-05 04:10:19,r/JPMorganChase,"Mid Career Crisis at JPMC, Advice Needed!","Hi Everyone!

I’m in a mid career crisis and need some solid advice! I recently joined JPMC about a month ago, coming from another prestigious bank that only offered a hybrid schedule. I took this job mainly for the senior title and the name recognition, so I can be more competitive after a year. However, my salary didn’t increase much, and the return-to-office policy is already draining me. It’s physically painful, but my mind is still holding strong.

After just a month, my manager told me that I do not qualify for this senior title. The weird thing is he never interviewed me. This team is completely new, and the rest are internal transfers! He’s new, I’m new, and so is everyone else. I bet people left because of the RTO mandate. No one on the team helps, and we just go to the office before 9 am and leave after 5 pm, answering stakeholder questions, running workflows, and pulling massive datasets without even understanding what the columns mean.

I’m wondering if I can ask for an internal transfer. I don’t think I’ll survive this probation, and given the current labor market, I feel like I’m really screwed. Does anyone have advice on what I can do?

**Update:**  
I think now my skip and the MD know that I am underperforming, and we’re about to have an internal conversation. I guess I’m screwed. What my manager wants is someone who can pick up tasks fast and start delivering work, but in week 3 I’m still trying to obtain access. I’ve had some exercises to test my capability, but it seems like I’ve failed them all, so my manager thinks I don’t deserve the title. However, I have no mentorship or support, as the team is new. Folks who interviewed me aren’t on my team.

  
**2nd Update**:

I talked to my manager and MD, and they both suggested I apply internally or externally, plus I can get a 30-day improvement period. What should I do? Should I give the 30 days a try to build up the skills (e.g., SQL or Alteryx) that I haven’t fully worked on? These skills I thought I had time to pick up when I join for the first 90-day, but now I need to deliver results on immediately. Should I start applying internally and externally right away? It will be very difficult, though, because my resume is already ruined.",35,7,firerabbitboy,https://www.reddit.com/r/JPMorganChase/comments/1mhwvsp/mid_career_crisis_at_jpmc_advice_needed/,1mhwvsp

Later that week, the recruiter contacted me, asking that I reapply through a new job link, explaining that I couldn’t be moved into the correct requisition. I submitted the new application as requested. Then last Friday — when I was anticipating the offer — she followed up to ask if I had received and completed the form requesting my date of birth and Social Security number.

I called Chase today and spoke to their Benefits Team to ask for more specifics, and I was extremely disappointed at the lack of information that she was able to provide. She said that reduced Daycare only counted towards Bright Horizons, and literally did not know about any of the other benefits. When I asked her about them specifically, her only suggestion was that I could use my Dependent Fund towards the waived/discounted fees, which makes absolutely no sense. 

Does anyone have any specific information about these benefits? There’s only a short blurb about them, but they sound like they could be great.",2,0,ButtonFormal2784,https://www.reddit.com/r/JPMorganChase/comments/1mcrxh7/mi_new_hire_question_regarding_childcare_benefits/,1mcrxh7

I joined the firm last year in October as software Engineer II.
I thought it would be a good opportunity for me, but unfortunately, I ended up in the worst project — and to make things worse, with the most incapable, soul-sucking manager.
He constantly compares me with every teammate. Add to that the constant pressure for ""visibility"" and the RTO mandate — it’s overwhelming.
Every day, I try hard not to quit impulsively, because I know it might hurt my career.
But the pressure is so intense that I feel like I’ve forgotten all my skills.

Personally, I’m feeling more frustrated as time goes on, not just by the actual in office requirement but by the complete lack of clear communication around it.

We keep hearing “100% in the office” as the blanket expectation, but beyond that there’s very little guidance. Is it about badge swipes? Certain days being more visible? Is anyone tracking? And if so, what are the consequences? Anyone heard about people being let go for not meeting this unwritten expectation?

It’s hard to feel motivated when leadership isn’t transparent, and even harder when you’re watching productivity take a hit while people burn time commuting just to sit on Zoom calls they could have done from home.

Is anyone else feeling this way? Have your teams had any real conversations about what’s expected or is it still just vague mandates with no context?

Would love to hear how others are handling it. Are you adapting, pushing back, or looking for something more flexible?",97,17,[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/JPMorganChase/comments/1mc8189/rto_how_are_we_feeling_vent_post/,1mc8189

2025-07-25 19:29:41,r/JPMorganChase,Jamie Dimon Can Keep His Office - I’m Gone,"I just left JPMorgan Chase (Plano) effective immediately and honestly it feels like a huge weight has been lifted off my chest. The place is beyond toxic. Nobody cares about people anymore. They just care about deadlines.

You could be sick, on vacation, dealing with something personal, whatever; all they care about is whether the work got done. I have literally had to respond to pings while sick in bed. Got paged on weekends for changes that were not even in production. Just pointless tasks that easily could have waited. No respect for personal time or boundaries.

The return to office push was the final straw for me. We proved for years that remote work was just as productive if not better. But leadership kept dragging people back into buildings just to make it look like things were normal. They say it is about collaboration but no one is actually collaborating. Everyone is tired and wants out.

And I have to say it because no one talks about it enough; the hygiene situation in the office is disgusting. Grown adults using the bathroom and walking straight out without even looking at the sink. Like did you just forget how to be a functioning member of society? It is nasty and I hated touching anything in there. Keyboards, door handles, coffee machines. It felt like a health risk every day.

And Jamie Dimon, if you ever read this; Fuck You!! you are hands down the worst CEO I have ever worked under. Completely out of touch with your own employees. Forcing return to office like we are children who need to be babysat. No one respects it. No one wants it. And people are leaving because of it. Good luck holding on to your workforce while pretending this is leadership.

I am done. I am never going back. There is life after JPMC and I already feel more human just being out.

* Does my line manager get notified when I apply for an internal role?
* Do internal candidates go through the same interview process as external candidates?
* What does the job grade mean? For example, if I'm interested in job grade 603, what are the implications?
* If I'm hired into a new role, how much notice do I need to give to my current team?

I applied for a job at JPMC and omitted my current short term job off my resume at time of applying since it’s both a transitional short term and not at all relevant to the role I’m applying for (or previous work experiences on my résumé for that matter). My goal was to only include work experiences, etc. on my resume that align with the position I’m applying for — all the rest of my work history is included, I only omitted my current job since it wasn’t relevant to the role I was interviewing for unlike the rest of my previous employment history, I didn’t speak to it in the interviews either cause I honestly thought it just made sense to speak to my previous employment,/roles that aligned with the role I was interviewing for- I wasn’t deliberately trying to mislead or lie- Never been in this situation before and just thought that’s what made sense as others have said when it comes to resume experience and relevancy. If I get an offer(strong chance), I know it’s best to include it on the background check form (along with any supported docs) regardless, to be complaint/transparent however I’m now freaking out after seeing how strict JPMC is with their background checks and others getting job offers rescinded, since it wasn’t included in my resume and worried now they will possibly retract on a potential offer due to discrepancy…Im prepared to speak to it and be transparent if asked about it.

Should I just be upfront with recruiter and/or hiring manager now 1) before I even get the offer and 2) before the background check begins (once/if I get offer) OR Just wait to explain once the background check comes back?? My first time ever applying for a job with a finance company and never had to deal with this level of stringent screening and background process I’ve heard JPMC has… I just thought whatever you put on resume is what you align with on your background check and that’s it..never had Issues with background checks before. 

I heard they usually ask for 7-10 full employment history on background check and most likely it will show up - so I didn’t think it wise to not put it on there and make the situation worse—and that HR cross-references the background check results with what what’s on your résumé afterwards..

2025-07-17 17:15:13,r/JPMorganChase,"Wash Your Fking Hands – We’re Back in the Office, Not Back in the 3rd Grade","
It never fails to amaze me how grown-ass adults—working at one of the biggest banks in the world—still treat handwashing like it’s optional. Like, did y’all skip the global pandemic? Did you sleep through the last 20 years of basic hygiene PSAs? Or are we just raw-dogging germs now as a lifestyle?

And now, here we are—reluctantly shoved back into full-time return-to-office life. After years of remote work, where our biggest hygiene concern was whether our coffee mug had mold, we’re suddenly expected to share bathrooms, keyboards, and handshakes again. Cool. Love that for us.  Unless I’m shaking poo and pee particles.  

But what’s not cool? Watching grown adults leave a stall like they just dropped a nuclear payload… and then walk right past the sink like they’re late for a meeting with God. No rinse, no soap, no shame. Just straight out into the wild with poop particles riding shotgun.

Let’s not forget the urinal dashers—hit their stream, shake it twice, and back to their desk like they didn’t just bring a sprinkle of pee into every spreadsheet they touch. And then there are the nose-blowers who treat paper towels like magical bacteria erasers, casually dabbing snot and heading out like it’s totally fine.

It’s not fine. It’s gross.

We didn’t want to be back in person, but fine—we’re here. You’ve got your badge, your office chair, your passive-aggressive Teams messages. Great. Now all I ask is you use the same hands you type those “Per my last email” responses with… to wash themselves.

This isn’t a gym locker room or a gas station off highway.  This is a multi-billion dollar workplace full of espresso machines and biometric badge readers. If we can afford catered lunches and standing desks, we can afford 20 seconds at the sink.

Wash your hands. With soap. Like you mean it.

EPS came in at $5.24, beating Bloomberg consensus of $4.47.

Interesting points:

Last year’s quarter had a one-off $7.9B gain from Visa shares, so the drop looks worse than it really is.

CEO Jamie Dimon highlighted strong CET1 capital ratio at 15% – “well above requirements.”

Net interest income guidance was raised to $955B for FY25 (previously $945B).

Dimon noted U.S. economic resilience but warned about tariffs, geopolitics, deficits, and asset bubbles.

2025-07-14 19:29:12,r/JPMorganChase,Accepted AI/ML Role at JPMorgan Chase: Need Honest Insights (Houston Office),"
I’ve recently accepted a Senior Associate (AI/ML) role at JPMorgan Chase in their Houston location and had a few questions/concerns I was hoping to get some honest input on.

For context, I hold a PhD and recently started a full-time remote role at another company, but the salary wasn’t sustainable (especially for a PhD-level role). I’ve now made the switch to JPMorgan Chase with a ~$35–40K increase in total compensation and a much stronger profile.

That said, I came across a few Reddit posts that raised concerns, so here are some specific things I’d love clarity on:

1.	In-office Requirement:
During the interview, my manager said it would be 4 days/week in-office, but I read that some teams are required to come in 5 days. Does this vary by team or manager?

2.	Bonus Structure:
I heard that bonuses tend to be good in the first year but drop significantly after that. Since the bonus is a major part of my TC, I’m wondering, is it possible to maintain similar bonuses year-over-year if you perform well?

3.	Parking at the Houston Office:
I’ll be driving to work and read there’s a parking garage at the JPMorgan Chase Tower. Can anyone confirm if employees can get a monthly pass? What’s the cost like?

4.	Hybrid Policy During Pregnancy:
My partner and I are planning to have a child within the next year or 2. I came across some info suggesting pregnant employees might get flexibility with hybrid options, is that true, and how supportive is the policy in practice?

5.	Work-Life Balance &amp; Culture:
Is the workload intense like in FAANG companies? I asked my manager and he said it’s been manageable so far (he’s new too), but I’d love to hear from people who’ve been around longer.

6.	Business Casual Attire:
I was told the dress code is business casual. Is that strictly expected every day, or do people generally dress more casually depending on the day or team?


Would really appreciate any insights or advice trying to go in with eyes open since I am deeply concerned reading so many negative comments.

Thanks in advance!

2025-07-10 21:56:50,r/JPMorganChase,The Cultural Shift at JPMorgan Is Hard to Ignore,"Once again, JD has made headlines for his blunt views—this time criticizing members of the Democratic Party for supporting DEI, calling them “idiots.” While I’m not blindly loyal to DEI initiatives myself, his repeated disdain for it throughout the year is telling. It’s not just about DEI—it reflects his growing disregard for the well-being and dignity of JPMorgan’s employees, especially those from marginalized groups.

DEI isn’t a silver bullet, but it symbolizes a basic acknowledgment of employees’ diverse backgrounds and needs. To undermine even this minimal effort suggests a culture shift away from empathy and inclusion. The change from “DEI” to “DOI” earlier this year wasn’t just a rebranding—it was a signal: equity and fairness are no longer priorities.

JD’s rhetoric around both return-to-office mandates and DEI sends a clear message—employees are no longer seen as partners in success but as obstacles to manage. His top-down, combative leadership style fosters discontent, not productivity.

As a former JPMorgan employee, I know firsthand how talented, driven, and committed the staff are. The company has thrived because of its people—not despite them. But if leadership continues to ignore and alienate the very workforce that powers the institution, that strong culture won’t survive.

JD’s strategy seems clear: stir division, pressure half the workforce into leaving, and overburden the rest to prove loyalty. That’s not leadership. That’s control through fear—and it only serves the executive ego, not the long-term health of the firm.

I’ve chosen to take my talents to a competitor—one that values collaboration over control and recognizes that respect and compassion are far more powerful motivators than micromanagement from a corner office or a Zoom call in a gray cubicle.",216,30,Snoo34567,https://www.reddit.com/r/JPMorganChase/comments/1lwmh7t/the_cultural_shift_at_jpmorgan_is_hard_to_ignore/,1lwmh7t
2025-07-10 20:36:50,r/JPMorganChase,I worked for CCB as a Software Engineer,"TLDR: I’ll start with this. Chase is one of the worst employers I have ever had in my life. If you agree, you can stop reading. If not, then allow me to walk you through my experience working there for ONLY 1 YEAR. 

Edit: I didn’t even mentioned RTO and I wrote an essay already lol 

Section 1: The Tech Stack 

I see a lot of people here saying that Chase is one of the “best places to work” and have “cutting edge tech”. It’s just another Java shop. No shade to Java. It’s the industry standard. But this is not just any ol java shop. It’s a jungle of messy code, inconsistent standards, microservices HELL. I mean HELL. Like if you were a bad person in you life, it is solving dependency issues and doing angular migrations. Maybe it was just my team but wow, the tech was a cluster fuck from the code, the management, the unnecessary calls, the bureaucracy, the IDIOTIC managers that have no management skills or people experience but chose a manager path because they are too incompetent to be an IC (more on that later when I get to the People section). But again - the tech sucks. I’d made me hate Java (which is nuts because it was my first language so I loved it)

Section 2: The People 

Man. Where do I start. I feel like Chase embodies the silo mentality. This extends in a lot of ways. There is NO diversity. It’s reddit so I don’t want to give my race but I was the only of my race in literally the ENTIRE floor. My god - talk about cultural differences. And I feel that it was this difference that alienated me in a lot of ways. The people around me treated me like an idiot as I was trying to ramp. They isolated me with tasks. They did not like it went I spoke up. It was beyond a toxic environment. I don’t want to keep going because I can feel JPM boot lickers commenting “oh you’re just a disgruntled employee”. And yeah I am, but I also would like to give a warning as someone who is working at a much better place now. 

Section 3: Contract Work 

So everything I said applies if you are coming into Chase full time. However if you are a contractor (H1B or other) - PLEASE KEEP READING. 

I am a citizen. However I took this job with Chase as a contractor because I was desperate (the job market is awful which is another convo for another day). It was contractually written that I would be a contractor for 3 months. I was a contractor for a year. And this is common. You are initially lied to my managers about this and are strung along just so they have bodies to do work. A lot of orgs in Chase are stingy with budget and a lot of times they don’t approve conversions. Or if they do, it is a very slow and daunting process. Moreover, people who are here on H1B are under enormous stress and working at Chase made me really empathize with them. Ive heard (not seen) about toxic managers threaten people to work harder due to their immigration status among other awful things. It’s a shame that Chase doesn’t treat their contractors better as a whole.

I have teammates that are supposed to support users… some try, others don’t… Questions almost always come back to me.

Management tells me that my priority is to build out specific tools, align code with standards, meet deadlines, etc… but when push comes to shove, if users escalate, it’s “let’s just take care of this”.

Full time RTO has made it worse. People will just come up to my desk and stare at me until I help them…. Forget getting into any kind of coding flow.

Sometimes I’ll grab a conference room…
Sometimes I’ll put headphones on, so it looks like I’m in a call…
Sometimes I’ll block my calendar…

In the end, I just think people would rather spend their time getting me to do their work than doing it themselves.

I had my first round of interviews with JP Morgan Chase for a Quant Associate role in analytics, and it went really well. However, it took about a month before the second round (which was with a Director) was scheduled.

Now, it’s been 20 days since the second round, and HR says it’s “not a definite yes or no” and that my candidature is on hold while they assess other candidates.

It’s just frustrating not knowing where I stand, and I’m trying to figure out if this is normal. Has anyone else faced a similar situation with JP Morgan, especially for quant or analytics roles? How long did it take for them to get back to you, and is there anything I can do at this point besides just waiting?

Any insights from people who have worked or are working there would be really helpful.

Just wanted to rant. Over the last six months, I have lost so many good colleagues due to the RTO policy. They are the best in terms of culture and technical skills.

Three types of Outcomes I saw:

1. Move to a top-paying hedge fund: Since it's both 5-day RTO, might as well get a huge salary bump moving to buy side,  benefits and perks are much better too (free lunches/ better setups etc.)
2. Take a pay cut/ flat salary and move to another bank: Barclays, Citi and DB are some more common options as they offer 3 days of WFH. Most who picked these options were parents, as they argued about the cost of childcare.
3. Transitioned to tech completely: Some people are just fed up with finance and moved to tech companies (all except Amazon)

I wonder if the company has any intention of keeping its best employees. I saw multiple deadlines being pushed back as the teams lost their main contributors. Hiring Managers are complaining every day about not being able to backfill roles, even with external candidates. Look, you are not paying a hedge fund salary but expect hedge fund performance, what do you expect? In the end, you will be left with the worst apples in the basket.

Making things worse, the job market started picking up recently with more openings across the board. Many of us are eager/ anxious to leave the company.",159,12,DifficultyIll572,https://www.reddit.com/r/JPMorganChase/comments/1lsjm12/tech_losing_all_the_best_colleagues_due_to_rto/,1lsjm12

2025-07-03 15:05:16,r/JPMorganChase,JPMorgan Chase Wins “Best Employer for Health &amp; Wellbeing” Award… Posts It Quietly Right Before a Holiday Weekend,"So this is rich.

JPMorgan Chase just posted on their corporate site (on July 3rd, conveniently right before the July 4th holiday when half the country is OOO) that they’ve won a “Best Employers: Excellence in Health &amp; Wellbeing” award—for the 14th consecutive year. The kicker? The award was actually announced back in April.

According to Lilly Wyttebach, JPM’s Head of Global Wellness, the firm won for leadership in health inclusion and mental health, saying:

“We owe this recognition to our senior leadership’s commitment to advancing employee wellbeing through comprehensive and innovative benefits and initiatives.”

Meanwhile…
Jamie Dimon is still publicly saying that employees aren’t as productive working from home—despite JPMorgan hitting record profits, announcing a $50B stock buyback (a 66% increase over last year), and raising the dividend by 7%. That’s a wild amount of excess capital for a company allegedly suffering from a productivity crisis.

So let me get this straight:
	•	The company posts huge returns and leads the market while employees are partially remote.
	•	Then they push an RTO narrative under the guise of “productivity.”
	•	And now they’re touting their mental health and wellbeing leadership—on a buried webpage the day before a major holiday—based on an award they got two and a half months ago?

You can’t make this up.

If the leadership actually cared about wellbeing, they’d recognize that flexibility and trust are cornerstones of a healthy workforce. Not just offering yoga apps and EAP brochures while forcing people back into cubicles.

Let that sink in.

The firm is generating so much excess capital that they’re returning tens of billions to shareholders, and yet we’re supposed to believe that remote work is somehow hurting performance?

You don’t announce buybacks of that size unless the business is absolutely thriving. And guess what? A big part of that “thriving” has happened while a chunk of the workforce has been hybrid or remote. So why the push to get butts in seats again?

This feels less about productivity and more about control. Or maybe real estate commitments they’re too proud to walk away from.

2025-07-02 06:53:33,r/JPMorganChase,Committed to JPM After a 3 Hour Commute,"Hey everyone, I need some advice, and thank you in advance. I just left another prestigious bank where I worked hybrid to join JPMorgan Chase full-time in the office. The offer was tempting with a bump of about $20K in combined salary and bonus, plus a title upgrade, but after one week I’m already having doubts. I think I may have made my worst decision, chasing a big name and career growth as a young professional.

At my old job I was almost entirely remote. My direct manager, dotted-line lead, and skip-level were all elsewhere, and I was the only person in New York. It felt safe but stagnant, mostly report writing, zero growth, and after the last round of layoffs I figured I would be next, so I started looking.

Now I’m commuting three hours round-trip every day to make a 9 AM meeting and don’t get home until around 7 PM. By Friday I was exhausted before I even logged on. My teammates and leadership are all on-site, and I’m realizing office life just isn’t for me. I’m torn, should I stick it out for three to six months and hope things improve, or start hunting for a remote-friendly role now? I’m also worried I won’t have any time to keep my coding skills sharp if this continues.

Has anyone here made the jump to full-time office at JPMorgan Chase? How did you handle the grind of the commute and still make time for learning and career growth? Any tips would be hugely appreciated!

**Update:**  
Hi everyone, thanks again for all the replies and advice. I wanted to give a clearer picture of why I took the $20K bump and why I’m already wondering if it’s worth it

1. I worry I could be on the chopping block by year-end or early next year, depending on senior management’s “strategy moves.” All of my managers and teammates are in Midwest, Europe, or India, and I’m the only one in New York. 

2. I have spent over two years just churning out reports, and it’s really stalled my growth as a tech professional. 

3. I didn’t expect 5-day in the office will completely suck my life dry. Between the 3-hour daily commute and the lack of any free time, I can’t fit in entertainment or skill-building. Even staying in a cheap hotel near the office would eat up, and probably exceed my entire raise. 

4. With layoffs continuing. like Microsoft announced cuts today, finding a new role, especially remote/hybird, feels nearly impossible right now. 

So am I stuck here for 3, 6, or even 12 months? I feel like I’m just stagnating unless I actually do get laid off at least then I’d gain some valuable JPM experience. Last question, does it make sense to tough it out, or should I start hunting for other opportunities now? :(",52,11,firerabbitboy,https://www.reddit.com/r/JPMorganChase/comments/1lpn6ff/committed_to_jpm_after_a_3_hour_commute/,1lpn6ff

2025-06-27 16:48:29,r/JPMorganChase,Temporary compensation adjustment?,"Hi all, a little background: I have been asked to work as a long term assignment to another department that is a higher job level than mine. Currently 502 with my new temp role as a 601.

I have been performing very well - so much so that I am being told 2 months in that I would be a perfect addition to the team and that they would try to get me in. They initiated mid year discussions with my current manager and his manager and have expressed wanting to take me on a more permanent position in the future.

The person I am backing up is currently in maternity leave and returns later in the year. I was not offered additional compensation (not that I expected it anyway), but since I am getting glowing reviews, I am reconsidering asking for temporary compensation adjustment eventually since I am pretty much at 80% of doing what other colleagues are doing in the team.

I was going to wait it out and keep impressing them but with the recent RIFs, I am worried that they will no longer have a place for me - especially when the person I am backing up returns.

My questions are
- has anyone been in this situation and requested temporary compensation adjustment? 
- was it successful?
- any other options to advocate for myself?

I really like this new role a lot and was willing to prove myself and eventually get a spot but with the recent RIFs, I am skeptical about them offering me a promotion.

My new manager did say that if it was in her ability to do so- she’d take me for sure but these decisions are being made above her.

2025-06-27 15:15:28,r/JPMorganChase,JPM Tech's pay is much better than other banks,"For more context, I work in CIB tech and was in a very difficult place last year. I actively sought external opportunities.

I interviewed with almost every single bank you can think of (GS/HSBC/Citi/Barclays/UBS, etc.), and landed an offer with some of them. I also interviewed with tons of hedge funds, but got rejected at the final stages.

I have an interesting finding, that most other banks don't pay as well as JPM? For the same level, they offered me a very flat/minimal raise in my base pay. Even so, some banks were struggling to offer that range and had to get tons of approvals from their management. Even if they did significantly raise my base, the bonuses are usually much worse. (DB told me their bonus is around 3%). My friends at other banks are shocked when I tell them about my bonus %.

Culture-wise, other banks are more humane in how they treat their employees (less stress + better WFH policies). But also, I noticed a much higher level of bureaucracy, most of the time, the seniors are not necessarily good in tech, but a crowd pleaser, you climb the ranks fast as long as you make people like you. I may be wrong, but in JPM, I find people tend to be technically strong and deliver business results to get promoted. I occasionally see people from big techs like Google/Amazon join the company.

Also, the tech stack is one of my main concerns when interviewing externally.  A lot of other banks have very legacy tech stacks that haven't been updated for ages and will never plan to do so. I'm used to the innovative dev tools that JPM provides.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying JPM is the best bank to work for, and in no way I'm the company's HR. The WFH policies screwed me and my team members over very badly, some of them have left. However, I just can't see myself working in other banks given the innovation, pay and interesting job content. 

I wonder if anyone has the same experiences or thoughts? Or am I living in my own bubble",57,12,DifficultyIll572,https://www.reddit.com/r/JPMorganChase/comments/1lltly9/jpm_techs_pay_is_much_better_than_other_banks/,1lltly9

I’ve made it thru several rounds of interviews for another VP role and feel like I have a decent shot, but worried how my ratings will affect things. Today I looked back at the job portal page and noticed the req I applied for changed the title from “Vice President” to “Senior Associate”.

I had a bill pay check come out of my Chase bank account for about $2k which I initiated.

I called Chase bank (recorded lines) to put a stop payment on the check (bill pay) immediately after it was issued (and 10 days before it was even mailed).

I am a private client banker with Chase bank, and hold a large balance there. A local bank Branch manager also called to ensure the stop payment was done well before it was cashed, and on recorded calls from Chase, we both were told that the stop payment was done correctly and the check was not yet cashed.

They failed to accurately put the stop payment, and the large check was cashed.

I have contacted Chase's executive team 1 month ago, and they haven't refunded me, and are not contacting me anymore. The branch manager has also gone silent, initially promising me that Chase would make this right, and the 'bank error' would be corrected months ago.

2025-06-21 13:48:47,r/JPMorganChase,Shareholders should sue Jamie Dimon and Chase for RTO,"This is clearly affecting workers, leading to terrible press, and literally is not bringing value back to them, because now having to maintain all these buildings instead of clearly saving money by having your workforce be at home, is not a worth while ROI. 

Idk just a thought, what do you guys think.

Edit 3: last edit, gonna stop saying this but STOCK VALUE does not mean SHAREHOLDER interest. Before you comment, look up Dodge v Ford Motor Company. Shareholders sued because Ford was paying their employees so much that they would never work for competition. Dodge brothers didn’t like that as shareholders, took it to the Supreme Court, and that’s where maximizing shareholder value comes from. Because IDEALS (I.e. we work better together then in remote roles), does not equate to hard facts (productivity of the workers, which Chase has admitted wasn’t different when workers were remote), to take on costs that are admittedly optional (building costs).

The argument is “Is operational costs for in office worth it if workers do the exact same work at home?”

THEN “Is forcing RTO putting into effect unnecessary spending, which impacts shareholders ROI?”

Apparently a lot of folks keep mentioning “line go up” for stock price for shareholders, but the argument is if the CEO knows that something could bring more value to his shareholders gets doesn’t do it on an idealogical grounds, he can be sued

Argue the point, not your feelings.


Edit: Ok apparently folks are not reading the post. I’m talking about SHAREHOLDERS, not Employees. Jesus Christ. There is legal precedent, I.e. Dodge v Ford Motor Company, for shareholders to sue their company for not returning shareholder value.

My argument is RTO does NOT bring in shareholder value and is a willing case by the board, to purposefully not return shareholder value, because upkeep for all of these buildings, when the work can obviously be done from home, doesn’t not make sense for ROI. Engage the argument instead of bootlicking for corporate overlords. Jesus Christ.

Edit 2: AGAIN, the argument is does unnecessary overhead from operational costs (having 300k+ people in office) make sense for shareholder value if the company has admitted there was no lose of productivity from remote work. THAT is the argument. Stop talking about how you don’t care about worker feelings, stop talking about people should stop complaining. ENGAGE the argument. What sense does it make to take on massive operational costs when the company has self admitted remote work was just as productive, and lead to massive savings, leading to great ROI for shareholders",132,71,Western-Key-2309,https://www.reddit.com/r/JPMorganChase/comments/1lgupb4/shareholders_should_sue_jamie_dimon_and_chase_for/,1lgupb4

I have got an offer from JPMC, Bangalore and I am supposed to join them in two weeks but looking at the feedback for JPMC, it seems like I am making a terrible decision.

I would be joining the Asset and Weath Management LOB. Please advise.

EDIT: Update on my joining

Hi folks!
I have joined JPMC finally after a lot of contemplation and peer pressure. 

Questions as a new Joiner: 

1. Why doesn’t JPMC provide laptop?? 
2. Doesn’t JPMC provide any new joiner KIT? On the first day, they provided a backpack and a diary, both made of recycled stuff. Quality is not good!! Service Based Organisations are at-least better than this! They at-least provide a good welcome kit!! 

3. The reimbursement for laptop is not provided anymore?????? 🥲🥲🥲🥲 

Virtual Agent shows that I am eligible for the laptop reimbursement, however, on Concur, there was no option to create an expense report for reimbursement of the WFH equipment. Has this option been disabled now??? 

So, what does this conclude - Am I eligible for it or not?

Application Upgrade Roadmap: 

My manager gave me an overview of the current tech stack, the application architecture, and the roadmap. While the roadmap looks promising, the existing tech stack feels quite outdated compared to the current market standards. I feel that if I continue here, I might fall behind in keeping myself updated with the latest technologies. 🥲 I want to keep learning new things in the market and that is something which the Service Based organisations can provide me. 

Now I honestly feel like I have made the wrong decision. Maybe associating with a Product Based should be done in later stages of life? 🫤 

Is Brand Value more important or the knowledge of latest technologies? I am honestly confused now!

I am about to sign a contract in another place, same commuting (a little bit easier to get it) but 2 days per week from home and much more money.

Despite that I feel sad and kinda guilty. I love my colleagues, my direct manager, my job and there are projects on me but if they had told me during the interviews: no wfh here; I am sure that I'd have stopped the process immediately.

So guys, what should I do?

Most firms that were both opening new positions and closing positions were relatively small in terms of total shares bought/sold with the exception of Nuveen, which opened a huge new position (listed below).

I don't have access to the raw data but here are some notable moves from the 3/31/25 (submitted/visible 45-days after) reporting date of the larger firms that have substantial holdings of Tesla that are at least in the billions.

*\*JPM analyst has one of the lowest price targets on Tesla and Canada was supposed to be ""mad"" at America. Ha! Not so much obviously...*

**Sellers (shares/% decrease in overall position):**

|Institution|Shares Sold|Percent Decrease In Position|

|Capital World Investors|(954,950)|\-2.317%|
|Fmr LLC|(4,448,041)|\-12.883%|

|New York State Common Retirement Fund\*|(112,326)|\-3.195%|
|Ark Investment Management|(28,594)|\-0.87%|

*\*I assume these sales are politically motivated to some extent.*

Again, trying to be objective here, it clearly looks like moves to the upside are being made by more prominent name firms and in more dramatic fashion. There are two firms with over a billion in holdings that added triple digit percent increases and Nuveen, that made a massive move to rush in. Of course, I could go down the huge list of transactions and cherry pick things to paint the picture either way. Are there firms with hundreds of millions in holdings cutting their position by \~50%? Yes. But there are actually more making the opposite/optimistic move (as the overall numbers at the beginning of this post indicate).

My takeaway: The big boys are making huge moves on Tesla. There is a lot of institutional activity in general, with astonishing sums of money being injected into the stock by big name firms. Net flows in are larger than net flows out. Don't shoot the messenger- But the indicator is bullish. And the recent stock trend reflects it.",34,16,iD-10T_usererror,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kmks0z/tesla_institutional_investor_movement_mixed_bag/,1kmks0z

So I submitted my resignation - my manager was very aware I wasn't happy with my current role. I told him I've submitted my resignation and if he wants to discuss then to let me know, I'll listen and consider anything him and his boss say.

Currently have the SIE, series 6, 66, and life and health insurance licenses. Have been TRYING to move up at the firm ever since I hit 2 years in my current role and it’s like nothing is even moving forward. Literally had a recruiter I would not name who recruits mostly in the NYC area for entry level investment roles and had a great call with them everything went smooth and then just ghosted. Sent emails like once a month/two about 3 times in total and never heard anything back. Like it sucks so much when you work hard, have a great track record, a manager that vouches for you and co-workers who do as well but you’re looked down on by every other space just because you’re in the retail bank. I currently have really good offers from Fidelity, UBS, and BoA one of which is literally double my current salary but do not want to accept either because I want to stay within. 

This was my first job after high school and I’ve since climbed the rank from teller to banker. I took the 66 to make myself a better marketable candidate but it seems like literally no one in this space cares. Everyone says network I didn’t need to network to get those offers from the other large wirehouses.

I’m really not trying to be arrogant but this is just all so frustrating. Am I stuck here and cannot progress unless I leave and come back? That seems to be what everyone does these days. Those that were able to pivot from an RB position into entry level roles on the wealth side/ JPM side, how did y’all get that to happen? Any tips/advice will really be appreciated. Thank you.

http://archive.today/mflqA

Earlier this year you required JPMorgan employees on hybrid schedules to return to the office five days a week. Has there been a lot of churn?

We’re not here for the employee; we’re here for the customer. And if it hurts younger people, is that fair? And if it hurts the company for innovation and growth and speed, is that right? …
There’s been no turnover. People are going back to work. There were complaints about the first day in certain sites — not enough parking, their cafeteria’s overcrowded. Well, I’m like, OK, get over it. I mean, it’s OK. …
I completely understand if someone else wants a work-from-home company. They will lose in the marketplace. The other thing is, we have 10% working from home. Always have, permanently. So I’m not against working from home. I’m against working at home when it doesn’t work for the company, the clients. And so we did it by job type. So, no, we’ve had no real pushback, no pushback, no attrition. I think we’re a great place to work.",28,5,Psychological_You650,https://www.reddit.com/r/JPMorganChase/comments/1kfbii4/get_over_it/,1kfbii4

* April 10: HR interview
* April 14: First interview with the VP
* April 22: Second interview with the ED

To sum it up: Did a phone interview, was supposed to receive some type of link to set up an in-person interview. I never got the link and there was no way for me to get in contact with the recruiter. Went to the actual branch i did the phone interview for with my info and explained my situation. Was told that they would forward my stuff to HR to get things cleared up. Still got rejected 2 weeks later with no contact. All of this took place over the course of 1 month.

1 month of getting my hopes up only to be shot down. I have spent the past month applying to every Associate and Relationship Banker position that goes up in NYC. AB positions take like 1 week to get rejected and they come back as ""No longer under consideration."" I have been told that this means I made it past the initial HR screening and was passed up for a different candidate. The RB positions on the other hand, I get rejected within the hour. I have 2 years of teller experience coming from TD Bank. I understand that I do not have the licenses needed for RB, but I was told that Chase would provide the training and help you get them if you got the job.

I have filled out like 60 different applications for this bank at this point. My main question is what's going on? Why keep people in limbo if you are just going to reject them? Why say you will forward my stuff to a hiring manager and not do that?

Capital One’s ([COF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/COF?.tsrc=fin-srch)) $35 billion purchase of Discover ([DFS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DFS?.tsrc=fin-srch)) just got the green light from key regulators, paving the way for the formation of the biggest credit card company in the US.

Two regulators responsible for the deal's approval — the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) — said Friday that they had approved the transaction, based on the companies meeting a few final conditions.

""This approval is granted based on a thorough review of all information available,"" said a letter from the OCC's Large Bank Licensing office.

The Fed and OCC said in separate statements that they concluded the merger is consistent with their statutory merger approval rules.

Specifically, the regulators found that combining the two companies would not substantially lessen competition, jeopardize the convenience and needs of the communities either of the banks serve, reduce the effectiveness of either institution’s ability to combat money laundering, or bring more risk to the banking and wider US financial system. The OCC said in its statement that it concluded the merger is consistent with rules laid out in the Bank Merger Act.

Approval of the merger also came with a consent order with Discover and a $100 million fine for overcharging customers certain interchange fees from 2007 through 2023. Discover has since terminated these practices and is repaying those fees to affected customers, the Fed said.

The OCC said its approval was conditional on Capital One providing it with a plan ""to address the underlying root causes of any outstanding enforcement actions against Discover Bank and plans for remediation of harm.""

# A new biggest lender

A purchase of Discover by Capital One would make the biggest credit card issuer in the US by loan volume, bigger than even banking colossus JPMorgan Chase ([JPM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/JPM?.tsrc=fin-srch)) by that measure. Capital One is well known for its ubiquitous TV ads that ask, ""What’s in your wallet?""

The combined bank is expected to have consolidated assets of approximately $637.8 billion, making it the country's eighth largest bank, according to the Federal Reserve.

Capital One would also gain a sizable credit card payment network of more than 300 million cardholders, allowing it to more heavily influence the fees that merchants pay when consumers swipe their cards at the register.

“The OCC is committed to a regulatory framework that expands access to financial services for consumers, businesses and communities,” Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney Hood said in a statement with the release.

All required regulatory approvals to complete the transaction have now been received, and the transaction is expected to close on May 18, 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, according to Capital One.

In a joint statement from the banks, Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank said the approval was an ""exciting moment.""

""We understand the critical importance of a strong and competitive banking system to our customers and our economy, and we appreciate the thoughtful and diligent engagement of our regulators as they thoroughly reviewed this deal over the past 14 months,"" he said.

2025-03-19 06:55:08,r/stocks,Trump’s Trade War 2.0: The Stocks I’m Watching,"With Trump back in office and tariffs returning in full force, I’ve been analyzing what this means for U.S. equities. His latest moves—25% steel and aluminum tariffs, expanded levies on Chinese imports, and a tariff-heavy negotiation strategy—echo his first term but with even **stronger measures**.



While 2018-2020 gave us some clues, the market setup in 2025 is **different**:

• **Higher inflation &amp; rates:** Tariffs add inflationary pressure, making the Fed’s job harder.

• **China’s response will change:** Unlike in 2018, China now **dominates EV battery production** and **controls rare earth supply chains**—this could hurt U.S. tech more than before.

• **Supply chain resilience is mixed:** Companies have talked about reshoring for years, but it’s still expensive and slow.

Given these factors, here’s how I’m positioning:

**Likely Winners:**

1. **Steel &amp; Aluminum (NUE, STLD, CLF)** – Tariffs give them pricing power, though cost inflation is a risk.

2. **Defense &amp; Cybersecurity (LMT, PLTR, CRWD)** – “America First” likely means **higher defense budgets**.

3. **Regional Banks (JPM, BAC, GS)** – If deregulation follows, these should gain.

4. **Domestic Infrastructure (CAT, DE, OSK)** – If tariffs hurt foreign suppliers, U.S. construction demand rises.



**Likely Losers:**

1. **Tech Giants (AAPL, NVDA, QCOM, INTC)** – Heavy China exposure = supply chain and revenue risks.

2. **Consumer Goods (NKE, WMT, DG)** – Imports get pricier, and passing costs to lower-income customers is tough.

3. **Auto &amp; Industrial (TSLA, GM, F, MMM)** – Higher input costs + China retaliation = pain.

4. **Agri Exporters (ADM, TSN, BG)** – If China targets U.S. farm products again, these get hit.



**What I’m watching:**

📌 Will China retaliate with rare earth metal export bans? (Impacts TSLA, NVDA, QCOM)

📌 Do inflation expectations rise, pushing Fed policy hawkish? (Bad for rate-sensitive stocks)

📌 Does Trump backtrack on any tariffs? (A la 2019)

📌 Will domestic manufacturing gains **outweigh** supply chain disruptions?

I’d love to hear counterpoints. Which stocks do you think will **outperform or underperform** in Trump’s Trade War 2.0?",488,234,notllmchatbot,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jeqaup/trumps_trade_war_20_the_stocks_im_watching/,1jeqaup

2025-02-04 21:43:45,r/stocks,Citibank(C) is Fundamentally Undervalued - Long Term Buy,"Took a couple days off work to reallocate my portfolio. I've been posting about XYZ, but I believe there are other highly compelling opportunities (C/GS) in the financial sector that people are overlooking. 

**Disclaimer: None of these views reflect the company I work for and are my own opinion**

A quick macro take would indicate that under this administration - the big banks and financial companies should print money (think: lower Corporate Income Tax, less regulatory restrictions on Capital holding requirements, increased M&amp;A, but most importantly a hell of a lot less Federal oversight). Most high quality banks  \~I think\~ will get rerated with premier institutions \[JPM, GS\] being valued at close to 17x and BAC at near 15x, and C following closely behind at \~14x. Again it's all just a guess, but **I believe CitiBank is one of the most undervalued companies in the market.** 

\- FWD PE: 10.63, Trailing PE: 13.38, PEG: 0.86, but my personal favorite is their book value of 0.78 - when banks print $ and get rerated it's a \~guesstimate\~ of nearly a 40% discount off the stock's intrinsic value of $125 - high margin of safety 

\- Simple Ballpark DCF with an 8% Discount Rate and 2% Terminal growth rate again points to a value in the $170's. Wild. 

\- Other Stats: Net Interest Income grew 27% over 3 years, though 14% over 5 years. Net Income grew 46% this year \[though -37% over 5 years\]. EPS grew 47% in 1 year. 

\- Other factors to consider: 

Fantastic Management --&gt; I really like Jane. Think she's a fantastic CEO who's really helped turned that franchise around. 

Retaining High Quality Talent --&gt; They promote/pay much earlier than most of the industry allowing them to retain high quality talent for years. 

Dividend: 2.8% :)  

Stock Buybacks - Someone on reddit said this earlier but I'll echo: ""If the CEO's of companies aren't buying their own stock then why should I"". I don’t mean this literally. I mean if the company itself is not buying their own shares at depressed prices then it’s a bad sign. They announced a massive buyback of $20 billion. 

Risks: It's the 3rd best bank which means that ultimately people might prefer going to other the premier institutions \[JPM, BAC, GS, MS\] instead. It's a bank. If Trump yells at Jane it won't be good for the stock.

In doing so I have noticed the difficulty in valuing bank stocks. I like companies with long-term growth and a sound financial base, but I could not find such bank stocks using the valuation methods I know. At least, ROE, ROA, etc. are completely useless. I would like to know if any of you guys know of a good screening method when looking for bank stocks.

Incidentally, the screening setup I am currently using, which I barely discovered through trial and error, is that the company has a market capitalization of at least $5 billion, has not reduced its dividend in the past 10 years, and has a positive total asset growth rate and net profit margin. This is a good assessment of profitability and growth, but not of financial health.

Also, I already have positions in XLF, JPM and BRK. Several of my friends have recommended that I invest in other quality financial stocks (like MSCI, NASDAQ, S&amp;P) that are not bank stocks because of the current real estate market conditions, etc. I would like to know about counterproposed stocks if you have the same opinion as my friend!",31,16,vistron6295,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i6e1ip/how_to_discover_the_best_bank_stocks/,1i6e1ip
2025-01-15 13:13:35,r/stocks,JPMorgan Chase tops estimates on fixed income and investment banking results,"JPMorgan Chase on Wednesday topped estimates for fourth-quarter revenue and profit as its Wall Street division posted better-than-expected results in fixed income trading and investment banking.

Here’s what the company reported:

Earnings: $4.81 a share vs. $4.11 LSEG estimate

Revenue: $43.74 billion vs. $41.73 billion expected

The bank said profit rose 50% to $14 billion in the quarter as noninterest expenses fell 7% from a year earlier, when the firm had a $2.9 billion FDIC assessment tied to regional bank failures.

Revenue climbed 10% to $43.74 billion, helped by Wall Street operations and better than expected net interest income.

Banks ended the year with several reasons to be bullish: Wall Street activity has picked up at the same time that Main Street consumers remain resilient, while the election victory of Donald Trump has led to hopes of regulatory relief.

JPMorgan, the biggest American bank by assets, stands to benefit on several fronts.

Last month, executives said that investment banking revenue would surge 45% in the fourth quarter, and that trading revenue would jump about 15%.

Further, the bank said that its latest projection for 2025 net interest income was $2 billion higher than previous guidance, leading analysts to speculate that fourth-quarter NII would also top expectations.

While the business is thriving, analysts will likely ask CEO Jamie Dimon about his succession planning after his No. 2 executive, Daniel Pinto, said he was stepping down as chief operating officer in June. Dimon signaled last year that he was likely to step down as CEO within five years.

Another question is how the changing outlook for Federal Reserve rate cuts will impact the bank across its sweeping operations. While Fed officials expect two more cuts this year, economic indicators could cause them to pause.

Finally, analysts may press JPMorgan on what it intends to do with a possible windfall of capital if Trump regulators present a gentler version of the Basel 3 Endgame, as potential nominees have supported. Dimon said last May that share buybacks would be muted because the stock was expensive, but they’ve only climbed since.

Besides JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and Citigroup are also reporting quarterly and full-year results Wednesday, while Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are due to report on Thursday.

2025-01-07 00:36:45,r/stocks,"What’s your 2025 strategy, position changes or thoughts?","I wanna start by saying I’m not trying to instill gloom or influence anyway to take any actions. I wouldn’t even really say I’m making any predictions. But I have been thinking a lot about the market and about my portfolio. And I’ve been taking actions. I really want to hear what others are doing and thinking, if folks are preparing or hedging, or just continuing to ride the wave.



So to get the elephant out of the room, the market is very richly valued. We can use any number of arguments, benchmarks or other metrics but I don’t really think anyone is gonna argue the equities market is at a historically rich valuation. 



My portfolio specifically is all US equities, and I think the U.S. equities market and economy has an outsized influence on the rest of the world. And the U.S. has some turbulence ahead: an increasingly high national debt, a plan to cut taxes (which will almost surely add to the deficit), potential tariff increases which could have a big impact on the stubborn inflation, and slower rate cuts than expected. 



To manage my own risk tolerances I’ve made some fairly heavy shifts to cash out of a few profitable positions and what I consider riskier equities, respectively. I recently sold 300 JPM shares and have far otm covered calls on several of my holdings. I am 35 and have no plans to fully exit the market, and specifically no plans to touch ETFs, but I will say I’m feeling the fear. I am personally in a very comfortable position but I like to over prepare. Recessions, job losses, market downturns, and global tensions if not outright expanded war seem quite possible at this point. I am ready to hold more cash and potentially deploy it outside of the equities market down the line, but also between keeping some dry powder and beefing up my emergency savings I’m feeling more and more like cash is the safest bet.

I'm 41 and only just started my Roth IRA.

So my thinking is for example is it better to buy 2 shares of stock A at $200 per share or 8 shares of stock B at $50 per share, or no difference?

However in recent times my conviction on adding more capital to this portfolio has waned. I just feel the best days in terms of returns for some of the big tech groups may not be what they were for the past decade.

I could 100% be wrong and there is no doubt there is certain bias seeing the return of my smaller positions this year dwarfing the ones of the traditional blue chip guys if you will.

So saying all this I’m considering: 

50% S&amp;P

10% Hood

10% Rddt

10% Rolls Royce

10% Cava

5% Lunr

5% ASTS

Quick rationale for each:

Hood: Expanding to Europe and offering very exciting new products like Hood Gold 

Rddt: Fastest growing social media, ARPU and monetisation only getting better and seeing many more people using

Rolls Royce: Slight European exposure, building low cost Nuclear plants and capturing the wide body aircraft market

Cava: Fantastic management, strong customer retention and expected to double stores in next 5 years

Lunr &amp; ASTS: Moonshot (literally), this is just in case space works out and much more speculative

Of course, some have performed great, largely because my timing, mid-2022, was an excellent entry point. But of course, I can't help brag about my selection choice.

I (think), I hit most of the semiconductor names, except NVDA. For some reason, it never felt like a good investment. I have my skepticism about LLMs and Gen-AI hype.

AMD is different because of data center servers product line - which is more solid story.

Besides missing such obvious biggies, not all of what I touched has performed. I felt, European carmakers (BMW, VW, MBG) were deep value at PE 3-5 and 8-9% yields, but obviously I was wrong. They were cheap for a reason.

I built this “portfolio” 4 years ago and am up 30% or so, the reason for the “perceived” underperformance is that I’ve increased my monthly contributions since last year which has led to a large rise in average cost basis. I’m hoping to cross the 100k mark in the next 12 months if the current trajectory continues. 

While I recognize that investing is a long-term game, the process feels slow at times. I'm curious to hear from others who have pursued a similar passive investing strategy.

How long did it take for your portfolio to reach a point where the annual passive income matched or exceeded your annual salary? When did you feel comfortable enough with your portfolio's performance and size to consider retiring or achieving financial independence. Specifically, how long did it take before you felt your portfolio could sustain your lifestyle without the need for additional income from employment?",1652,330,Ok_Criticism_558,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1exozc8/has_anyone_on_here_actually_become_rich_just_from/,1exozc8

2024-08-01 20:13:46,r/stocks,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&amp;P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&amp;P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&amp;P 500 over the next 24 months.

Hi! I am an ex-prop shop trader who trades equities.



This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all the stocks on here, or none of them, and stocks not on here on any given day! I only hold MAG7/general broad market indices long-term, unless otherwise noted in the ticker. If you use old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly.



I usually make these watchlists premarket, but can be delayed if I am trading the open. These are not mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.



Some stocks I post are &lt;$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like “Thoughts on \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_?” or “Is \\\_\\\_\\\_ a good investment?” will be ignored unless you add detail and your own opinion. I will block you if you are a troll.

[NVDA](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d) - We also saw this turn more strongly than the other Mag7 stocks because of the close to 15% move we saw it make in the past week. No opinion on this yet, but watching for a setup.

2024-07-12 14:40:48,r/stocks,JPMorgan tops second-quarter revenue expectations on strong investment banking ,"JPMorgan Chase on Friday posted second-quarter profit and revenue that topped analysts’ expectations as investment banking fees surged 52% from a year earlier.

Here’s what the company reported:

Earnings: $4.26 per share adjusted vs. $4.19 estimate of analysts surveyed by LSEG

Revenue: $50.99 billion vs. $49.87 billion estimate

The bank said earnings jumped 25% from the year-earlier period to $18.15 billion, or $6.12 per share. Excluding items related to the bank’s stake in Visa, profit was $4.26 per share.

Revenue rose 20% to $50.99 billion, topping the consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by LSEG, helped by better-than-expected investment banking fees and equities trading results.

CEO Jamie Dimon noted in the release that his firm was wary of potential future risks, including higher-than-expected inflation and interest rates, even while stock and bond valuations currently “reflect a rather benign economic outlook.”

“The geopolitical situation remains complex and potentially the most dangerous since World War II — though its outcome and effect on the global economy remain unknown,” Dimon said. “There has been some progress bringing inflation down, but there are still multiple inflationary forces in front of us: large fiscal deficits, infrastructure needs, restructuring of trade and remilitarization of the world.”

Shares of JPMorgan slipped 1% in premarket trading.

A rebound in Wall Street activity, especially on the advisory side, was expected to aid banks this quarter, and JPMorgan’s results bear that out.

JPMorgan reaped $2.3 billion in investment banking fees, exceeding the StreetAccount estimate by roughly $300 million.

Equities trading revenue jumped 21% to $3 billion, topping the estimate by $230 million, on strong derivatives results. Fixed income trading jumped 5% to $4.8 billion, matching the estimate.

But the bank had a $3.05 billion provision for credit losses in the quarter, exceeding the $2.78 billion estimate, which indicated that the bank expects more loan defaults in the future.

“JPMorgan has navigated a challenging interest rate environment very well,” said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consulting firm Opimas.

Still, while banking and equities trading boosted results, “We see Main Street banking beginning to sputter,” Marenzi said. “Provisions for credit losses were up significantly, showing us that JPMorgan is expecting to see a rough patch in the US economy.”

Wells Fargo and Citigroup also report earnings Friday, while Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley report next week.

* The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said that the so-called living wills of Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America filed in 2023 were inadequate.
* Regulators found fault with the way each of the banks planned to unwind their massive derivatives portfolios; derivatives are Wall Street contracts tied to stocks, bonds, currencies or interest rates.

Banking regulators on Friday [disclosed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20240621a.htm) that they found weaknesses in the resolution plans of four of the eight largest American lenders.

The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said that the so-called living wills — plans for unwinding huge institutions in the event of distress or failure — of [Citigroup](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/C/), [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JPM/), [Goldman Sachs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GS/) and [Bank of America](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BAC/) filed in 2023 were inadequate.

Regulators found fault with the way each of the banks planned to unwind their massive derivatives portfolios. Derivatives are Wall Street contracts tied to stocks, bonds, currencies or interest rates.

For example, when asked to quickly test Citigroup’s ability to unwind its contracts using different inputs than those chosen by the bank, the firm came up short, [according](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20240621a3.pdf) to the regulators. That part of the exercise appears to have snared all the banks that struggled with the exam.

“An assessment of the covered company’s capability to unwind its derivatives portfolio under conditions that differ from those specified in the 2023 plan revealed that the firm’s capabilities have material limitations,” regulators [said](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20240621a3.pdf) of Citigroup.

The living wills are a key regulatory exercise mandated in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. Every other year, the largest US. banks must submit their plans to credibly unwind themselves in the event of catastrophe. Banks with weaknesses have to address them in the next wave of living will submissions due in 2025.

While JPMorgan, Goldman and Bank of America’s plans were each deemed to have a “shortcoming” by both regulators, Citigroup was considered to have a more serious “deficiency” by the FDIC, meaning that the plan wouldn’t allow for an orderly resolution under U.S. bankruptcy code.

Since the Fed didn’t concur with the FDIC on its assessment of Citigroup, it was overall deemed to have the less-serious “shortcoming” grade.

“We are fully committed to addressing the issues identified by our regulators,” New York-based Citigroup said in a statement.

“While we’ve made substantial progress on our transformation, we’ve acknowledged that we have had to accelerate our work in certain areas,” the bank said. “More broadly, we continue to have confidence that Citi could be resolved without an adverse systemic impact or the need for taxpayer funds.”",76,18,StatQuants,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dlb1jh/regulators_hit_citigroup_jpmorgan_chase_goldman/,1dlb1jh
2024-06-10 08:04:41,r/stocks,Bank of America overvalued? ,"High interest rate environment has been pretty good to banks in the past year, posting strong earnings every time. Q1 earnings JPM gave mediocre guidance and stock dropped 6%, Citi, Bank of America, and Well Fargo all three beat earnings and left guidance mostly unchanged. All four bounced back after the market correction finished. All except BAC are lagging behind SPY since May 1st, JPM up 4.4%, C barely up, WFC -1.95%, but BAC is up 7.6%. All except BAC are trading slightly above or just above their 50-day EMA, with JPM trading \~2% above and BAC trading 4.5% above.

So my question is that if Q1 earnings and outlook are so similar for all 4 major banks, and they generally all do the same thing, why is BAC stock up so much more and seem overextended compared to the other 3? I understand that Warren Buffet holds $35bn of BAC stock but he has since 2007 and his last purchase was in 2023. Is it solely because of his name or am i missing something here?

What's the catch of BAC outperforming its peers?

2024-04-29 22:37:32,r/stocks,"VISA and JPM, 2 companies for 2 economic scenarios","Disclaimer I held a position in Visa and a smaller one in JP Morgan for a couple years, and plan on adding some shares in the next few days

1. Rates cuts and higher inflation = great time for VISA.
A expansionary monetary policy would increase consumer spending in real terms, and accelarate nominal spending even higher because of inflation. Both of these trends would benefit VISA, since it has great pricing power and charges a fixed percentage on any transaction. VISA has little need for capital, so an increase in nominal spending would boost revenues while inflation is unlikely to affect his costs, thus further expanding it's already incredible margins. I believe the transition away from cash to card would be accelarated, both because of less cash in the wallet and the advantages of financing purchases at lower rates.
I think visa could return 15% y/y in this situation, with 12 free cash flow growth and FCY of 3%.
The only risk I see are slower growth (current PE of 30) and governament regualtions.

2. High rates low inflation = great time for JPM. In this situation JP Morgan chase would probably be able to expand its balance sheet, because of people moving their asset into JPM from smaller and riskier banks, as well as Aquistions of distressed banks very short on liquidity. In addition, the Bank would be able to employ this capital at high rates, and increase its credit spread substantially. All of this should lead to massive profits, putting JPM fortress balance sheet in an enviable position, like we saw in 2022.
I'm this scenario I think 15% returns are possible ( 6% free cash flow growth and 9% FCY)
The main risk I see is a fall in CIB revenues and some losses on the asset side (few distressed loans and marking to market some bonds with high duration)

The financial sector is historically quite risky, and prudence is key when investing, however I think these companies will do great is some scenario, and good in others, and survive in all but the most tragic ones, thus MAY offer and interesting Risk/Reward proposition.

2024-04-12 13:05:05,r/stocks,"JPMorgan Chase tops expectations on trading results, lower-than-expected credit costs ","JPMorgan Chase reported first-quarter earnings before the opening bell Friday.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street analysts surveyed by LSEG were expecting:

Earnings: $4.44 per share, vs. expected $4.11

Revenue: $42.55 billion, vs. expected $41.85 billion

JPMorgan will be watched closely for clues on how banks fared at the start of the year.

While the biggest U.S. bank by assets has navigated the rate environment well since the Federal Reserve began raising rates two years ago, smaller peers have seen their profits squeezed.

The industry has been forced to pay up for deposits as customers shift cash into higher-yielding instruments, squeezing margins. Concern is also mounting over rising losses from commercial loans, especially on office buildings and multifamily dwellings, and higher defaults on credit cards.

Still, large banks are expected to outperform smaller ones this quarter, and expectations for JPMorgan are high. Analysts believe the bank can boost guidance for 2024 net interest income as the Federal Reserve is forced to maintain interest rate levels amid stubborn inflation data.

Analysts will also want to hear what CEO Jamie Dimon has to say about the economy and the industry’s efforts to push back against efforts to cap credit card and overdraft fees.

Wall Street may provide some help this quarter, with investment banking fees for the industry up 11% from a year earlier, according to Dealogic.

Shares of JPMorgan have jumped 15% this year, outperforming the 3.9% gain of the KBW Bank Index.

Wells Fargo and Citigroup are scheduled to release results later Friday, while Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley report next week.

2024-01-04 04:35:45,r/stocks,The Current State of JPMorgan Chase and the banking sector,"Hello, friends. Let's talk about the immediate future of the biggest bank in America by total assets, JPMorgan Chase (ticker JPM).

&amp;#x200B;

As we know, the banking sector took a beating in 2022 as inflation grew less and less transitory and people expected the Fed to raise interest rates. 2023 wasn't all sunshine and rainbows either but on 12/13/2023, following the rate-hike pause, the entire market shot up (especially fintech and banks).

&amp;#x200B;

There isn't much news that's going to shake up the behemoth's fundamentals any time soon, but technically, it's definitely somewhere in the overbought zone in terms of indicators like MACD or RSI. SPY was in this position until the first day of the year, and it began to correct itself both market days thus far, while JPM went up the first day along with other banks, albeit slightly scathed today.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not expecting a massive correction, but I do see some reasons that could potentially trigger a small one:

(1) Jeffrey Epstein Document: I have no idea how this is going to unfold and it's probably a stretch but JPMC has a history of being involved and I remember the stock suffering because of the news. Doesn't seem like much of a factor, if that, but it doesn't help the market.

(2) Non-Farm Payrolls this Friday: I suspect the market will react negatively to this as the economy's feeling more and more of the interest rate hikes; A lot of people underestimate how long it takes for interest rate policy to take effect on the economy (not the market). Historically speaking, I would say anywhere from 6 months to 18 months. The market's already expecting a lower number, but I'm hoping people will realize the higher interest rate is starting to take its toll on the economy.

(3) Inflation Data next week: Inflation, as I observed, is more resistant to change the lower it is. I'm not doubting the analysts' forecasts but inflation has been cooling awfully fast this past year, which is great but I think the market is seeing inflation as too much of a linear entity (see below for reference). I'm hoping it comes hotter than expected, although I'm probably biased.

*Inflation rate in 2023 from Jan to Nov. (Source: https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/#:\~:text=The%20annual%20inflation%20rate%20for,ET.):*

*6.4	6.0	5.0	4.9	4.0	3.0	3.2	3.7	3.7	3.2	3.1*

&amp;#x200B;

(4) Technical reasons: In additional to the technical reasons I stated above, JPM has pretty much hit its near-exact all-time-high price earlier today. I'm expecting a healthy pull-back and I think that could come in the form of either back-testing to other technical price/line like 200 EMA, or consolidating near that point. I'm hoping it won't consolidate because there's too much happening in the market, (it is the first week of the year after all) and it back tests instead.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm neither an analyst nor an economist, so I don't know to what extent any of these will affect the market but I wanted hear others' insights on the matter :)

P.S. I am currently holding a small put position, but will likely be adding more.

&amp;#x200B;

It is also chartered in CA where most of of the turbulence happened. There has been a lot of negative pressure on it because of that proximity. However, EWBC is very different from the other names you have seen in the news. They cater specifically to the Asian-American community and have branches all over Eastern Asia as well as CA and several other states.

&amp;#x200B;

The fundamentals are simply off the charts. They are extremely conservative and have always been. Their CEO,Dominic Ng, has been with the company since the early 90s and is well-respected in the banking community and in China-US relations and is a big driver of the conservative position. 

&amp;#x200B;

They reported earnings a couple weeks ago and had record net interest income while other banks have been trending down for multiple quarters now. This is likely because of their large cash position and the fact that they had dry powder to essentially ""average down"" in treasuries. They have a sizeable cash hoard compared to other regionals of their size. Their costs were elevated last quarter and therefore it was a slight miss YoY comparison in earnings. They are currently absorbing clients from their failed competition and are spending on those. They had record deposits again this quarter.

&amp;#x200B;

Their credit quality is far and above almost all other banks I have looked at. Their ratio of high quality loans (CET1) is higher than most major banks including JPM. With the bond yield inversions close to going positive again, banks that don't have credit or liquidity issues will mop up for the foreseeable future. EWBC is also doing buybacks this quarter while other banks are scrambling for liquidity.

*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slumped Friday for a fourth straight session, and notched their worst weeks since March, as traders seemed to book profits following the latest corporate earnings releases and U.S. jobs data.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 shed 0.53% to finish at 4,478.03, while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.36% to settle at 13,909.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 150.27 points, or 0.43%, to end at 35,065.62.
*****
&gt; All the major indexes reversed earlier gains during afternoon trading, and finished the week with losses. The Nasdaq and S&amp;P dropped about 2.9% and 2.3%, respectively, to notch their worst weeks since March. The Dow edged down 1.1%.
*****
&gt; “People this week seem more respectful of risk than they were before,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, adding that “lots of bears have been capitulating, which is often a sign that we’re closer to the end of a rally than the beginning.”
*****
&gt; After being lower on the day, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) rose to trade above 16 — pointing to investors adding volatility protection.
*****
&gt; Friday marked the final day of what’s been the busiest week of second-quarter earnings season. Amazon jumped 8.3% to its highest level in nearly a year after trouncing expectations on profit and offering positive guidance. Apple lost 4.8% after reporting lower revenue than the year-ago quarter. Both tech giants reported results late Thursday.
*****
&gt; In a sign of the boom in travel and services demand, Booking Holdings gained 7.9% on stronger-than-expected results. Amgen popped 5.5% on solid earnings and a boosted guidance.
*****
&gt; Earnings reports this season for the quarter ended in June have continued to surprise some Wall Street analysts as the expected slowdown in profits proves less than feared. About 84% of S&amp;P 500 companies have given results, with 80% surpassing Wall Street expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield also pulled back from a multimonth high to 4.04%. Its rise in recent sessions had pressured risk assets.
*****
&gt; # A cooler jobs report

&gt; Investors also received more clues into the state of the labor market with Friday’s payrolls report. The data showed 187,000 jobs added in July, less than the 200,000 expected by economists polled by Dow Jones. The unemployment rate also ticked lower to 3.5% from 3.6%.
*****
&gt; Despite the cooler headline numbers, average hourly wages pointed toward more inflation and came in ahead of expectations, rising 0.4% for the month, and 4.4% on an annualized basis. That came in slightly ahead of the 0.3% and 4.2% expected, respectively.
*****
&gt; Many on Wall Street had been eagerly awaiting the jobs report and its implications for the Federal Reserve’s rate-hiking cycle. About 88% of traders expect the central bank to hold rates steady at its next meeting in September, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
*****
&gt; But next week’s consumer price report for July could make an even greater impact on rate expectations, said Wells Fargo’s Christopher Harvey.
*****
&gt; “A hotter-than-expected print is one of the few things that could really start to change the market’s perception of the Fed, and maybe the Fed’s perception as well,” he said. “But today’s job number, I don’t think does much of anything. I think it solidifies people’s view that the Fed is done at this point.”

&gt; # The Economy is Normalizing, and That’s a Good Thing

&gt; The economy created 187,000 jobs in July, slightly softer than the 200,000 that economists expected. The last couple of months were revised lower, and so it’s always helpful to take a 3-month average, which is now running at 218,000. That’s stronger than the pre-pandemic average of 183,000.

&gt; In short, job growth remains strong. You will hear some people heralding this as the onset of a recession, but more likely this is just normalization of the economy rather than weakness. The report aligns with what we wrote in our Mid-Year 2023 Outlook, not to mention the title: “Edging Closer to Normal”.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-04-payrolls-601x800.png))**

&gt; The private sector created 172,000 jobs in July, up from 128,000 in June. On a sector level, job growth this year has been driven by non-cyclical areas like health care, education, and government. These sectors had lagged in the early recovery, accounting for just 13% of jobs created in 2021, and 25% in 2022. Over the first 7 months of this year, they’ve accounted for more than 50% of jobs created. July didn’t buck that trend, with health care seeing 100,000 jobs created. Government jobs were on the softer side, rising 15,000 in July versus an average of 53,000 between April and June.

&gt; The cyclical areas of the economy, especially construction, manufacturing, and leisure and hospitality, remain on the softer side, with job growth adding up to 34,000 across these three sectors. So far this year, these sectors have accounted for about 20% of job creation (not exactly “weak”), versus 36% in 2022 and 43% in 2021.

&gt; Again, the theme is normalization.

&gt; **The Best Labor Market Since the Late 1990s**

&gt; The unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, not far from 50+ year lows of 3.4%. What is amazing is that the unemployment rate is slightly below where it was in June 2023, when the Fed really started to get aggressive with rate hikes.

&gt; The unemployment rate can be impacted by people leaving the labor force (technically defined as those “not looking for work”) and an aging population. I’ve discussed in prior blogs how we can get around this by looking at the employment-population ratio for prime age workers, i.e. workers aged 25-54 years. This measures the number of people working as a percent of the civilian population. Think of it as the opposite of the unemployment rate, and because we use prime age, you also get around the demographic issue.

&gt; The good news is that the prime-age employment-population ratio remained at 80.9%. That is higher than at any point since May 2001. It was actually falling at that time, and didn’t recover until now. This is the best indication that the labor market remains very healthy, and probably in the best shape since the late 1990s.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-04-employment-population-ratio-612x800.png))**

&gt; **Bottom Line: All Signs Point to a Strong Economy**

&gt; The US economy runs on consumption, and for that you need income. The good news is that income growth appears to remain strong and looks to be running ahead of inflation. In fact, wage growth rose 0.4% in July. Monthly numbers can be volatile, but the 3-month annualized pace is 4.9%.

&gt; You combine strong wage growth with strong employment, and that translates to strong income gains across the entire economy. Over the last 3 months, overall income growth for all workers is running at a 5.3% annual pace. Meanwhile, headline inflation is running close to 2.0%. The difference between the two tells you how fast incomes are growing after adjusting for inflation, and that’s running above a 3% annual pace over the past 3 months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-2023-08-04-real-income-growth-584x800.png))** 

&gt; In my opinion, that’s your simplest measure of underlying economic growth and should tell you things are ok. Normalization is not the same as weakness.

&gt; # Sentiment Swings Higher Despite Declines

&gt; Equities have rolled over in the past week with selling hitting a pinnacle when the US government's credit rating was downgraded by Fitch on Wednesday. In spite of this, sentiment has not taken a hit. The latest survey from the AAII showed 49% of respondents reported bullish sentiment which compares to 44.9% the prior week. With nearly half of respondents reporting as optimists, bullish sentiment sits handily above its historical average of 37.5%. In fact, this week marked the ninth in a row with a bullish sentiment reading above the historical average for the longest such streak since one that ended at 13 weeks long in May 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080323-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; The increase in bullish sentiment resulted in bearish sentiment to drop down to 21.3% which marks a 2.8 percentage point decline on the week and resulted in the lowest bearish reading since June 10, 2021 when it was 20.7%. Similar to bullish sentiment, that is the ninth week in a row with a reading below its historical average, and that is the longest streak since July 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080323-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; As a result to the increased optimism, the bull-bear spread ticked up from 20.8 last week to 27.7. That is still below the recent high of 29.9 from two weeks ago, but reiterates how investors have an elevated degree of optimism.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080323-AAII-4.png))**

&gt; Not all of the gains to bulls came from bears. Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling from 31% to 29.7%. That is in the middle of the past few years' range.

&gt; # Small Dent to Claims

&gt; Initial jobless claims have been trending lower over the past couple of months, reaching a nearly six month low of 221K last week. This week, claims rebounded rising 6K to 227K. Albeit off the strongest readings from last fall, that remains a healthy reading on joblessness.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080323-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims are at historically solid levels even if they have come off their best levels. This week, claims dropped to 205K. That is slightly above the readings from the comparable weeks of the year of the past few years (excluding 2020 and 2021 when claims were much more elevated).

&gt; At this point of the year, claims falling is normal as shown in the second chart below. The current week of the year has only seen claims rise week over week 10.7% of the time. That is the sixth most consistent week of declines of the year. Claims will continue to face seasonal tailwinds in the weeks ahead, but that will begin to reverse as summer turns to fall.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/080323-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; Continuing claims also ticked higher in the latest week's data, reaching 1.7 million. Although higher than 1.69 million the previous week, continuing claims have much more consistently been trending lower recently, and this week's reading did in fact come in below forecasts of 1.705 million.

&gt; # Downgrades Overlooked

&gt; The bottom has dropped out for the major US indices today with the Nasdaq down over 2% and S&amp;P 500 down 1.25% as of this writing. The catalyst has been the downgrade of the United States' credit rating by Fitch from AAA to AA+ . That is the first downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt in almost twelve years and just the second ever. In the charts below, we show the performance of the S&amp;P 500, government debt, commodities, and the US dollar in the year before and the year after the 2011 downgrade.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has been rallying in the months leading up to this downgrade, however, back in 2011 the S&amp;P 500 had already begun rolling over by the time S&amp;P downgraded US debt. In the wake of that downgrade, the S&amp;P 500 went on to fully erase all of the prior year's gains. Fortunately, all of those losses were quickly recouped within three months of the downgrade.

&gt; As for Treasuries and other US agency debt, performance over the past few months has been the complete opposite of 2011. Of course, the interest rate environment is also completely different now with Fed Funds 500 bps higher than it was at the time of the last downgrade. That being said, in 2011, Treasury yields were on the decline in the months headed into the downgrade, but contrary to what might have been expected, the downgrade itself did not change that trend. This time around has seen yields on US government debt moving in the opposite direction.

&gt; Bloomberg's broad commodity index has been in a similar boat with the past few months seeing a decline compared to the steady uptrend back in 2011 that was uninterrupted by the downgrade.

&gt; Finally, we would note the downgrade only acted as a longer-term turning point for the dollar. As shown in the bottom right hand chart, both this year and in 2011, the trade weighted dollar was in a downtrend in the year before the downgrade. But right as S&amp;P changed its rating, the dollar turned higher and continued to rise throughout the following year. In fact, one year out it had erased the entirety of the previous year's decline.

&gt; # Stocks Don’t Like August, Now What?

&gt; “Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.” President Dwight D. Eisenhower

&gt; Another month and more strong gains. Make that five months in a row, the S&amp;P 500 finished higher. The S&amp;P 500 is now up close to 20% on the year, just like everyone predicted.

&gt; We came into the year overweight stocks and remain there, so this run has been a lot of fun for us. But honestly, while we’ve been bullish, even we’ve been surprised by how strong markets have been.

&gt; So let’s get the bad news out of the way. The odds are increasing that stocks could finally take some type of a break. Seasonality has worked out perfectly this year. Here’s a chart we shared many, many times, and it said that some of the very best quarters out of the entire four-year Presidential cycle were the three now just behind us. Sure enough, the fourth quarter last year and the first two quarters this year were spectacular for stocks, just like history suggested. Now seasonality is saying to be open to some type of weakness, or at least a break.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-1.gif.png))**

&gt; To be clear, we do not expect major weakness. But we believe a modest pullback of approximately 5% would be perfectly normal. The S&amp;P 500 has closed higher for five consecutive months. And we’re now moving into the austere month of August. August has been a poor performer, ranking worse than only February and September since 1950 and trailing behind only September and December in the last ten years, although still averaging a positive return over both periods. Oh, and right behind August comes September, the weakest month seasonally. So, while the calendar was a tailwind, we believe it is now becoming a near-term headwind.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-2-copy.png))**

&gt; Taking another look at August, when stocks are up more than 17.5% for the year heading into this month, a breather is even more likely. We found 11 previous years (since 1950), this occurred, and August was higher only three times and down 1.1% on average. So the better the year, the worse August does, apparently.

&gt; One of the reasons we were on record for a surprise summer rally was how stocks tended to do when they had a big first month of the year. When the S&amp;P 500 gained more than 5% in January a summer rally tended to occur (check). But we take seasonal warnings as seriously as seasonal support, and now we are in a period of potential seasonal weakness, at least for the near term.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-3-copy.png))**

&gt; If stocks experience weakness over the coming months, investors may be surprised and even start projecting the catastrophe many had expected earlier in the year. But keep in mind a pullback in the next couple of months would be entirely normal seasonal behavior. In fact, it may present buying opportunities, or it may simply be a chance to stay the course and remind ourselves that most years see more than three separate 5% pullbacks. Even in a strong year, there will often be bouts of volatility, so we should be ready for it and avoid overreacting. As President Eisenhower said, start planning today.

&gt; Lastly, the S&amp;P 500 closed up five consecutive months yesterday. Historically, stocks have done quite well after similar streaks. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has been up a year later, 26 out of the past 28 times. However, the last time this happened was in June 2021, and that was followed by a drop of nearly 12%. Despite this recent example, the market’s historical strength is likely another indication of higher stock prices in the future.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/blog-4-copy.png))**

&gt; All in all, the odds are increasing that stocks could see some seasonal weakness, but we don’t think it will be anything major. In fact, maybe a little breather could be just what the bulls need for an eventual strong end-of-year rally.

&gt; # $10 Trillion Added in Market Cap; 2023's Best and Worst Through July

&gt; The US stock market (using the Russell 3,000 as a proxy) has now seen an increase in market cap of roughly $10 trillion from its bear market low last October through the end of July 2023. As shown below, the peak market cap for the US stock market was $51.5 trillion seen on the first day of 2022. From high to low, total US market cap fell $13.7 trillion during last year's bear, but since then it has risen back up to $47.7 trillion. To get back to new all-time highs, we currently need market cap to rise by roughly $3.8 trillion.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/r3k.png))**

&gt; The average Russell 3,000 stock rose 5.74% in July. There were 813 stocks in the index that rose 10%+ in July, including 29 names that rose 50%+. Below is a table of these 50%+ gainers. Four names rose 100%: PolyMet Mining (PLM), Quantum-Si (QSI), UroGen Pharma (URGN), and Bridgebio Pharma (BBIO). Other notable names on the list of big July winners include Nikola (NKLA), Upstart (UPST), Carvana (CVNA), QuantumScape (QS), Rivian (RIVN), and Riot (RIOT). This list is made up of many of the high-fliers during the post-COVID bull that then got slaughtered during last year's bear.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/08/rayjuly.png))**

&gt; Through July, the average Russell 3,000 stock was up 18.1% year-to-date. Below is a list of the 35 names that are already up 200%+ on the year. Topping the list is Carvana (CVNA) with a YTD gain of 869% after gaining 77.3% in July. Back in December 2022, CVNA had fallen into the $4s, but it's now back up to the mid-$40s. Next up is Bit Digital (BTBT) with a YTD gain of 638%, followed by Cipher Mining (CIFR), IonQ (IONQ), Riot (RIOT), and Applied Digital (APLD). Similar to the list of July's biggest winners, the biggest winners YTD are many of the names that got hit the hardest last year, with many falling more than 70% during their bear market drawdowns. Carvana, for example, was actually down 98% from its all-time high when it bottomed in 2022, so even after gaining more than 800% this year, it needs to gain another 700% from here to get back to new highs.

&gt; # Key ETF Performance Through July 2023

&gt; The S&amp;P 500-tracking ETF (SPY) finished July up 3.27%, leaving it up 20.62% YTD on a total return basis. The mega-cap Tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) gained only slightly more than SPY in July, but it's up more than twice as much as SPY on a YTD basis at +44.5%. The small-cap Russell 2,000 (IWM) did better than large-caps and mid-caps in July with a gain of 6.11%, but IWM is up less than large-caps on a YTD basis at +14.7%. Value and dividend stocks held up well in July and actually outperformed growth for the month, but value is lagging YTD and the DJ Dividend ETF (DVY) is actually down 0.5% on the year.

&gt; Looking at US sectors, Energy (XLE) and Financials (XLF) -- which lagged in the first half of 2023 -- did the best in July, while Health Care (XLV) and Real Estate (XLRE) were up the least. Technology (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC) are currently neck and neck on a YTD basis with XLK up 43.94% through July and XLC up just three basis points more at 43.97%.

&gt; Outside of the US, we saw China (ASHR) and Israel (EIS) gain the most in July, while France (EWQ) and Spain (EWP) gained the least. YTD, it's Mexico (EWW) that's currently atop the list of country ETFs with a gain of 42.85%.

&gt; Oil (USO) gained 15%+ in July, while natural gas (UNG) fell 4.2%. Gold (GLD) saw a small monthly gain of 2.3% versus a gain of 8.6% for silver (SLV). Finally, with yields rising again during the month, Treasury ETFs were in the red. Aside from natural gas, the 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT) is down more than any other asset class in our matrix on a YoY basis with a total return of -12.3%.

&gt; # Dogs of the Dow for the Dog Days of Summer

&gt; With the Dow coming off of a historic winning streak last week, below we check in on performance of the index versus the Dogs of the Dow. The Dogs of a Dow is a stock-picking strategy that invests in the index members with the highest dividend yields at the end of a year holds them through the end of the next year. On a total return basis, the Dow's recent winning streak has been a benefit to both the overall index and the Dogs alike. That said, the gains to the former have brought the index up near 2022 highs on a total return basis while the Dogs of the Dow has much further to go given the overall weakness of dividend-oriented equities recently.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/073123-d1.png))**

&gt; In the table below, we show the returns of this year's Dogs of the Dow and all other individual Dow members. The Dogs of the Dow are host to some of the stocks with the worst performance this year like Verizon (VZ) and Chevron (CVX), however, there are also a couple of big winners like Intel (INTC) which has returned nearly 42% YTD or JPMorgan Chase (JPM) which has nearly posted a 20% return. However, the biggest gains in the index have come from non-Dogs. In fact, the largest gains this year have been from those with the lowest or no dividend yields at the end of last year like Boeing (BA), Salesforce (CRM), or Apple (AAPL).

2023-08-01 04:38:08,r/stocks,The 2023 stock market rally got a lot healthier in June and July,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-2023-stock-market-rally-got-a-lot-healthier-in-june-and-july-210139678.html

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.

July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.

The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.
[Money doesn't grow on trees]

But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears — that the rally had become too concentrated — has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) logging gains between June and July.

And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.

This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.

Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notably, however, Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years.

[**Broadening of the market.**](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Cj8RJI9cSQHXtbHDpHlEqQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/134ad610-2fe2-11ee-bf6f-1ffefac75b64)

In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.

The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.

Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.

And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)

Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.

In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.

Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).

And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.

The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.

Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart — up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.

3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).

Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.

Consumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%. Telecom company Verizon (VZ) and pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) are also toward the bottom.",56,22,putsRnotDaWae,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/15ezvef/the_2023_stock_market_rally_got_a_lot_healthier/,15ezvef

2023-07-18 10:22:19,r/stocks,JP Morgan Chase earnings report,"The 2023 Q2 earnings report for JPMorgan Chase has just been released. Overall, the ER is a remarkable demonstration of the durability and power of the top bank. JPM's results, both top and bottom line, exceeded market forecasts. The fact that the bank declared a solid balance sheet during and after a highly tumultuous time for the banking industry is, in my opinion, more significant.   
The last one or two quarters have been described by certain media as the most difficult for banks since the 2008 crisis. JPM was able to keep a healthy standardised CET1 capital ratio of 13.8% even after the First Republic deal. J.P. Morgan was able to negotiate a favourable price because they were the only reliable buyer for FRC. In a back-of-the-envelope analysis of the transaction, Matt Levine of Bloomberg noted how J.P. Morgan receives good upside and regulatory protection while sharing a large portion of the potential losses if the loans default. Although the estimated $500 million in annual net income for the agreement is small in comparison to the $40 billion or so they already generate, it demonstrates that a bank like JPMorgan can take advantage of the crisis.  
The bank currently has $1.4 trillion in cash and short-term securities, which is a lot of liquidity. I have no doubt that JPM will be able to fulfil these new standards and keep its fortress balance sheet, even though there may be some capital changes and liquidity in the near future as the banking industry adapts to new rules.  
Given the current instability in the banking industry, regulatory standards may be modified in various ways. With Basel III's completion, Dimon himself anticipates ""material changes"" to capital and liquidity. He continued by issuing a warning that the market as a whole as well as end customers would probably be affected by these regulatory changes in the real world.

2023-07-14 13:39:26,r/stocks,JPM Net Income Surge 67% YoY to $14.5 Billion,"JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings Friday that topped analysts’ expectations as the company benefited from higher interest rates and growing interest income.

* Earnings: $4.37 per share adjusted vs. $4 per share Refinitiv estimate
* Revenue: $42.4 billion vs. $38.96 billion estimate

Net income surged 67% to $14.5 billion, or $4.75 per share. When excluding the impact of its First Republic acquisition in early May — a $2.7 billion “bargain purchase gain” from the government-brokered takeover, as well as loan reserve builds and securities losses tied to the purchase — earnings were $4.37 per share.

Revenue rose 34% to $42.4 billion as JPMorgan took advantage of higher rates and solid loan growth. Revenue gains were fueled by a 44% jump in net interest income to $21.9 billion, which topped the StreetAccount estimate by roughly $700 million. Average loans climbed 13%, while deposits fell 6%.

Shares of the bank climbed more than 2% in premarket trading.

JPMorgan has been a standout recently on several fronts. Whether it’s about deposits, funding costs or net interest income — all hot-button topics since the regional banking crisis began in March — the bank has outperformed smaller peers.

That’s helped shares of the bank climb 11% so far this year, compared with the 16% decline of the KBW Bank Index. When JPMorgan last reported results in April, its shares had their biggest earnings-day increase in two decades.

This time around, JPMorgan will have the benefit of owning First Republic after its U.S.-brokered takeover in early May.

The acquisition, which added roughly $203 billion in loans and securities and $92 billion in deposits, may help cushion JPMorgan against some of the headwinds faced by the industry. Banks are losing low-cost deposits as customers find higher-yielding places to park their cash, causing the industry’s funding costs to rise.

That’s pressuring the industry’s profit margins. Last month, several regional banks disclosed lower-than-expected interest revenue, and analysts expect more banks to do the same in coming weeks. On top of that, banks are expected to disclose a slowdown in loan growth and rising costs related to commercial real estate debt, all of which squeeze banks’ bottom lines.

Lenders have begun setting aside more loan-loss provisions on expectations for a slowing economy this year. JPMorgan is expected to post a $2.72 billion provision for credit losses, according to the StreetAccount estimate.

The bank won’t be able to sidestep downturns faced in other areas, namely, the slowdown in trading and investment banking activity. In May, JPMorgan said revenue from those Wall Street activities was headed for a 15% decline from a year earlier.

Finally, analysts will want to hear what JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has to say about the health of the economy and his expectations for banking regulation and consolidation.

Wells Fargo
also reported earnings Friday, and Citigroup results are on deck. Bank of America and Morgan Stanley report Tuesday. Goldman Sachs discloses results Wednesday.

# [Stock futures are little changed as traders look ahead to key inflation data: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/10/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were little changed Tuesday, after the major averages snapped a three-day decline, as traders await key inflation data slated for release later in the week.
*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures dipped slightly, while Nasdaq-100 futures nudged higher by just 0.05%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down 57 points, or 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Investors are coming off a positive session for the major averages. On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 209.52 points, or 0.62%, while the S&amp;P 500 advanced 0.24%. The Nasdaq Composite lagged, rising just 0.18%.
*****
&gt; The June consumer price index report set for release Wednesday, as well as the June producer price index due out Thursday, will shed light on whether the decline in inflation has continued, and create the backdrop for future direction of interest rates.
*****
&gt; Investors have penciled in another quarter-point increase at the Federal Reserve’s July 25-26 meeting. But they are undecided about what the central bank will do at its September meeting after last week’s continued robust jobs data raised concern that policymakers will revert to raising rates following the June pause.
*****
&gt; “The pause, agree or disagree, is to gather more information,” Solus Alternative Asset Management’s Dan Greenhaus said Monday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.” He added, “One more hike or two more hikes is much less important than when, ultimately, they begin to cut rates on the other side of this. That’s much more consequential for, I think, the risk landscape than one more hike or two more hikes.”
*****
&gt; On the economic front, June’s NFIB Small Business Index, a measure of business confidence, is set for release Tuesday before the bell. Economists polled by Dow Jones are anticipating a reading of 90.0, slightly higher than the 89.4 level in May.
*****
&gt; Second-quarter earnings season kicks off later this week with results from “systemically important financial institutions” such as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, plus BlackRock, PepsiCo and Delta Air. Dow component UnitedHealth reports Friday.

2023-06-28 23:15:46,r/stocks,Fed - Banks have enough capital to continue lending even if unemployment were to hit 10% and the stock market were to plunge 45%.,"All 23 US banks that participated in a new Federal Reserve stress test would be able to withstand a severe global recession, demonstrating the strength of the biggest financial institutions at a time when the banking industry still is on uncertain ground.

Results released by the Fed Wednesday show that these banks would have enough capital on hand to absorb losses and continue lending even if unemployment were to hit 10% and the stock market were to plunge 45%.

Their projected losses would amount to $541 billion under that hypothetical scenario.

The biggest of the group - JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) – all would have capital buffers well in excess of the Fed’s 4.5% minimum requirement under this extreme scenario.

Same goes for the mid-sized regional banks that were a part of this test, including PNC (PNC), Truist (TFC) and M&amp;T (MTB).

""Today’s results confirm that the banking system remains strong and resilient,"" Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr said.

""At the same time, this stress test is only one way to measure that strength. We should remain humble about how risks can arise and continue our work to ensure that banks are resilient to a range of economic scenarios, market shocks, and other stresses.""

Results did vary widely across the industry, however. The bank with the highest capital ratio under the Fed’s “severely adverse scenario” was Charles Schwab (SCHW), one of the lenders that came under a lot of investor scrutiny earlier this year as other banks stumbled.

The bank with the lowest ratio was Citizens Financial (CFG), a regional bank based in Rhode Island. Other banks with the smallest capital buffers were regional institutions that pale in size next to the giants of the industry.

But the giants also posted the biggest projected net income losses under the Fed’s “severely adverse scenario,” led by Citigroup's $34.9 billion. Wells Fargo had $32.9 billion and JPMorgan had $30.1 billion.

Goldman, perhaps the most storied name on Wall Street, had the highest amount of estimated losses from commercial estate loans and credit cards.

It also recorded the highest losses in separate Fed assessments of how the trading books of the biggest banks would perform under “global and exploratory market shocks.”



The Fed’s test, an annual rite of the industry since the 2008 financial crisis, is the first to be released since turmoil roiled the banking world following the failure of First Republic, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank this spring.

Banks typically use the results of the annual Fed stress tests to determine how much they should have on their balance sheet to absorb shocks and how much they have left over for dividends and buybacks. Later this summer, however, they are also bracing for a new set of higher capital requirements from the Fed that will force some of them to hold even greater buffers against losses.

These tougher rules were already in the works before the collapse of several regional banks in the spring, but regulators made it clear in the wake of those troubles that they wanted to make sure their new approach applied to mid-sized institutions similar in size to a First Republic or a Silicon Valley Bank. Both had more than $200 billion in assets at the time of their failures.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week he does not expect smaller community banks to be subject to the higher capital requirements. Institutions with at least $100 billion in assets may have to comply.

Forcing banks to amass greater buffers has pros and cons for lenders, regulators and the economy. It will increase the stability of these institutions, but it will also make it more difficult to earn robust profits and could cause banks to pull back on certain types of lending.

Powell discussed this balance last week.

“It’s always a trade-off,” he said. “More capital means more stable, resilient banking systems. It can also at the margins mean less credit availability…there is no perfect way to assess that balance.”

Barr, the vice chair of supervision, said last week the Fed is also exploring ""reverse stress testing"" that could be used as a tool to make banks more resilient by helping supervisors recognize more exogenous issues that could go wrong instead of patterns from the past regulators have been trained to catch.


The Fed first started applying stress tests to a wide group of banks in 2009, as the last financial crisis was still raging.

It was mandated annually by law for institutions with more than $100 billion in assets as part of legislation that passed in 2010. A law passed in 2018 tailored the tests by banks’ size, meaning those in the range of $100-$250 billion would be tested every other year.

Democrats and regulators have been critical of that 2018 adjustment, arguing it could have helped prevent the problems that amassed at Silicon Valley Bank, which had not gone through a stress test before it failed.

Some in this year's test — BMO Financial, Citizens, M&amp;T and RBC US Group — were among the every-other-year banks that weren’t scheduled to be tested again until 2024.

But the Fed required BMO, Citizens and M&amp;T to be tested again in 2023, and RBC also opted in to the 2023 exam. All four banks had capital of 6.4% and higher, above the 4.5% required.

This year the Fed examined how 23 banks would fare under a severe global recession that included severe stress in commercial real estate. In such a scenario unemployment spikes to 10%, home prices and commercial real estate plunge about 40%, the stock market plummets 45%, market volatility jumps and corporate bond yields rise.

All 23 banks in aggregate would have lost $541 billion. Yet they would still have capital equal to 10.1% of total assets weighted by risk. Well above the 4.5% the Fed requires.


The $541 billion in total projected losses include more $100 billion from commercial real estate and residential mortgages and $120 billion in credit card losses, both higher than the losses projected in last year’s test.

The banks with the biggest commercial real estate losses were Goldman, with $16 billion, followed by Morgan Stanley ($13.7 billion) and Citizens ($12.4 billion).

Goldman also had the highest credit card losses, with $24.7 billion, followed by Capital One ($22.2 billion) and TD Group ($21.4 billion).

Banks with large trading operations were also tested against a ""global market shock"" tied to their trading positions. For the first time, this year's test also added a second “exploratory market shock” to the trading books of the largest and most complex banks.

The global market shock is characterized by a severe recession with fading inflation expectations; the exploratory market shock tests a less severe recession with greater inflationary pressures induced by higher inflation expectations.

The results from those exams showed that the trading books of the largest banks were resilient amid a rising rate environment.

The biggest projected losses belonged to Goldman, with $21.2 billion lost in the global market shock scenario and $18.1 billion in the exploratory market shock component.

2023-06-02 06:12:42,r/stocks,What should I focus on when evaluating a stock if I want to be somewhat conservative?,"I recently read an article in Forbes titled ""Investment Advice From The Vietnam Veteran Who Turned A 2-Bedroom House Into A $4.7 Billion Fortune"" about Arte Moreno and his response to one of their questions made me curious:

&gt;**Forbes: What assets are you buying in this environment?**

&gt;Moreno: There are some stocks in the market right now I like. They get banged up, but I like the asset and you can average down if you look at it that way. Pretty much everything I deal with has some type of return on it; some kind of dividend. If you look back a year ago, we had very low interest rates, like zero. So when you're looking at a stock and not only do you really like the asset, but then they're giving you a dividend, it’s such a bonus. You're setting yourself up for potential stock growth, but you're also receiving 3% to 4% annually.

&gt; I really try to stay by the book: I like to buy companies at around 15 times price-to-earnings. I have a couple strong positions in Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple (AAPL). I've been buying Apple forever; every time it goes down, I buy more Apple. I also buy JPMorgan (JPM), which pays about 3% dividend. Another company I really like, and have been invested in for a long time, is Blackstone (BX). The multiple doesn’t fit in there because it's high, but I just like their whole portfolio of assets.

&gt; I’m really pretty good about keeping diversified. But I really look at stocks that give you a good dividend. I look at a company that's not generating any cash, has no dividend and has this crazy high PE multiple, and I just stay away. I think it's for other people. It's not for me.

He considers himself a fairly conservative and by the book investor, so I was interested in learning more about how you guys evaluate a stock and what you think of his approach.

For example, one stock that I've been looking at off and on for quite a while now, but don't own, is POSCO (PKX).  They're currently at a 9.32 PE, which is below the 15x that Arte Moreno looks for, but they have a 3.90% dividend and they're generating cash. Is that info enough to make an investment or do you look for more?

Edit: I guess at what point in time are small regional banks in the clear. Is it a wait and see? If that’s the case, it’s a 100% gamble on some of these smaller banks, they may go under, may not, and these massive drops and increases happen within a day or two which makes it impossible for retail to respond in a timely manner.

2023-05-03 08:43:47,r/stocks,Will the Cash App be the savior for Block struggling quarter?," Block Inc. ($SQ), whose Cash App is among the world's top 10 payment apps, will probably report a seventh consecutive quarter of net losses as revenue growth settles at a rate below its pre-pandemic norm.  

### KEY TAKEAWAYS

* Block will likely report a first-quarter loss of -$0.18 per share vs. -$0.38 per share a year earlier.
* Revenue is predicted to climb more than 16% to $4.6 billion.
* Block's gross payment volume is expected to climb 17% to nearly $51 billion.

Block is forecast to post net losses of $111.8 million, or 18 cents a share, narrower than losses of over $207 million a year earlier, according to analyst estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Analysts also predict revenue increased 16.5% year-over-year to $4.6 billion.1 Block reports earnings results after markets close Thursday.2

Block's transaction volumes surged in the second half of 2020 as e-commerce business swelled, but inflation and fears of a recession have quelled this rapid growth. Block's gross payment volume hasn't shrunk since 2020, but year-over-year growth has slowed from a peak of 88% in the second quarter of 2021 to 15% last quarter.

Block's Cash App is one of its primary growth drivers, and analysts expect revenue to top $2.8 billion, up from $2.5 billion a year ago.

CEO Jack Dorsey will likely face questions about a March 2023 report from short-seller Hindenburg Research accusing Block of inflating Cash App user counts.3 Block pushed back after the report was published, calling it ""factually inaccurate and misleading.""4

Dorsey could also report on efforts to expand Cash App's banking products, including the savings accounts it launched in January.5 The company and competitors like Apple ($AAPL) are adding traditional banking services to their platforms in an effort to retain users and become their primary banks. Big banks have responded in kind, with Bank of America ($BAC), JPMorgan ($JPM), and Wells Fargo ($WFC) reportedly developing a digital wallet of their own.  


Shares of Block are down almost 43% in the last year, while the benchmark S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Index is up 5%.",20,7,Theo_011,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/136crot/will_the_cash_app_be_the_savior_for_block/,136crot

# [Dow futures are flat after failed First Republic is sold to JPMorgan: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/30/stock-futures-are-flat-after-dow-notches-best-month-since-january.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures hovered around the flatline Monday after the major averages logged gains for April, and traders assessed the takeover of failed bank First Republic.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow climbed 21 points, or 0.06%, while S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures were flat.
*****
&gt; The moves come after news that JPMorgan Chase has acquired all of troubled lender First Republic’s deposits and a “substantial majority of assets,” according to a release. JPMorgan’s shares rose 3% in premarket trading on the news.
*****
&gt; “This takes away the uncertainty for the market,” Sarat Sethi, managing partner at DCLA, told CNBC’s “Worldwide Exchange” on Monday. “What you’ve seen now is an agreement where depositors will be taken over, and you’ve got some type of guarantee there. That’s important for the market because, you don’t want to see this kind of thing unravel.”
*****
&gt; First Republic reported last week that deposits tumbled more than 40% in the first quarter, triggering further declines in the already struggling stock. Shares have cratered 97% since the start of the year.
*****
&gt; The SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) rose about half a percent in the premarket, as investors bet the crisis that ignited in March had been contained.
*****
&gt; Stocks are coming off a winning week and month. On Friday, the blue-chip Dow added 272 points, or 0.8%, while the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.83%. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.69% as Big Tech earnings took center stage.
*****
&gt; For the month, the Dow gained 2.5% to notch its best monthly stretch since January, while the benchmark index gained 1.5%. The tech-heavy index posted marginal gains. Earnings reports from major tech companies dominated much of last week’s market debate, fueling the narrative that earnings are faring better-than-feared, despite many widespread macroeconomic concerns.
*****
&gt; So far, a little over half of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported earnings, with more than 79% and about 72% surpassing earnings and sales expectations, respectively. First-quarter earnings are currently on track to fall 3.7% for the period, a smaller drop than the 6.7% decline projected on March 31, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; “There was definitely a very positive surprise on the big tech earnings,” said Jan Szilagyi, CEO of Toggle AI. “There was a certain trepidation going into the earnings season,” as expectations called for relative weakness.
*****
&gt; Monday kicks off another busy week for earnings, with results from Norwegian Cruise Line and MGM Resorts. Reports from Pfizer, Starbucks, Advanced Micro Devices and CVS Health are due out later in the week.
*****
&gt; Reports from many of these technology giants helped to lift some market confidence, he added.
*****
&gt; In other news, investors anxiously await the latest rate hike decision from the Federal Reserve, due out Wednesday at the conclusion of the central bank’s policy meeting. As of Monday morning, about 89% of traders anticipate a 25 basis point rate hike, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. Wall Street will closely monitor remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, offering clues into the central bank’s forward policy path.
*****
&gt; Wall Street also awaits ISM manufacturing data, construction spending and S&amp;P Global manufacturing PMI on Monday. April’s nonfarm payrolls report is on deck Friday.

&amp;#x200B;

I will try to keep this brief, but would really love to have some conversations with others about my allocation because I keep thinking myself in circles.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently my portfolio is:   


* Spy/Voo: 47% 
* VXUS: 15% 
* Target Date - 2055: 7%
* SCHD:  5%
* QQQ:  1%
* Individual Stocks:  23% (3% Appl, 3% MSFT, 3% CRM, 3% ABBV, 2% Cost, 2% UNH, 2% JPM, 2% BRK.B, 2% WMT)

&amp;#x200B;

I have been targeting a portfolio that will have roughly: 

* SPY: 40%
* Target Date: 30% 
* VXUS: 10%
* ???: 15% 
* Individual Stocks: 5%

&amp;#x200B;

(Context, the VXUS will go down as my 401k invests into target date fund which is already 1/3 VXUS but I will use my personal brokerage to help rebalance as needed)

&amp;#x200B;

I have held most of the individual stocks for quite a few years, its how I got started investing. They have all done well, luckily to some degree and some due to not touching for a few years. 

I have gone back and forth researching, and thinking myself in circles. I have considered just selling my positions in Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, etc and buying QQQ to keep a large cap growth tilt but worry it is just chasing performance. 

I have considered heavily SCHD and AVUV; SCHD for the drip effect in my roth to let it accumulate tax free but just havent found a reason to have conviction given my timeline is 20-30 years. AVUV in theory sounds good, the short track record and the ability to stomach downturns of SCV at 10-15% of my portfolio is possible but there isnt a ton of data to back up the fund. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would love others thoughts and opinions on this, I have been in a mental pretzel for weeks thinking about this.",23,15,silenceisbetter1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12y39k6/how_to_best_allocate_final_15_of_my_porfolio/,12y39k6
2023-04-25 02:15:31,r/stocks,"M2 Money Supply Is Set to Contract Again. What It Means for the Fed, Economy, and Inflation.","https://www.barrons.com/articles/m2-money-supply-fed-inflation-262c7234

The Federal Reserve will update markets on the amount of U.S. money supply on Tuesday, offering a crucial clue to the path of inflation and the central bank’s coming interest-rate decision.

Money supply, measured by M2, is an aggregate of currency, coins, and savings deposits held by banks, balances in retail money-market funds, and more. This broader classification of money in the financial system entered the spotlight earlier this year after contracting on an annual basis for three straight months—an unprecedented streak since the data was first introduced in 1959. December was M2’s first year-over-year contraction ever, followed by January’s 1.75% fall and February’s 2.4% decline to $21.1 trillion, the steepest drop in money supply yet.

Just how much M2 will fall is a matter of debate, but few doubt it will decline again. Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson wrote this month that M2 is likely to “fall sharply” with the recent stress in the banking sector. Citi Global Economist Robert Sockin told Barron’s recently that he sees a continued contraction for “many more months forward.” Economic-forecasting firm Oxford Economics estimates a 2% drop in M2 in 2023 from 2022.

Another consecutive decline in M2 in March would provide more evidence that inflation should continue to cool and likely influence the Fed when it sets interest rates at its May 2-3 policy meeting.

The amount of money in the financial system is one of many critical factors for inflation. Very simply put, the less money there is floating around in the economy, the less there is for banks to lend and for companies and consumers to borrow and spend. In turn, that pushes down prices, helping cool the economy.

“It’s a clear positive signal for their fight against inflation,” said Sockin, although not “enough for them to declare their fight is over.”

Consumer prices have continued to fall steadily with the Fed’s nine consecutive interest-rate increases since March 2022. Inflation rose 5% in March 2023 on an annual basis, decelerating from February’s 6% pace and the June 2022 peak of 9%. It still, however, remains much higher than the Fed’s target inflation rate of 2%.

“Lack of money supply should take care of [inflation],” Vincenzo Inguscio, a London-based volatility strategist at Nomura Holdings wrote in a note last month. His calculations, based on past data, show inflation follows the money supply pattern with a two-year lag, he said in emails to Barron’s. Morgan Stanley’s Wilson, however, predicts that inflation lags one year behind M2.

The coming March data will also be the first look at the U.S. money supply since the banking sector turmoil unnerved investors globally. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March triggered a widespread selloff in regional bank stocks and raised questions about the health of the overall financial system in an era of higher interest rates. The panic among banks could be another factor that contributes to a likely contraction in money supply last month thanks to a decline in bank deposits.

For the most recent data available, Fed’s report showed deposits were down 6% for the week ending April 12 to $17.2 trillion versus a year ago. Deposits have been falling year-over-year since November, off slightly from the highest-ever $18.2 trillion level seen in April last year.

The impact of the banking-related stress will be more pronounced later in the year, according to Citi’s Sockin, especially as credit tightens. That’ll lead to extending fewer loans, which means there’s less and less need for deposits to back loan growth. “And that’s going to lead to less M2.”

Another force pushing down M2 is the Fed’s own actions. In May 2022, the central bank announced a plan to passively shrink its assets by letting securities “roll off,” or mature, without reinvesting much of the principal received, thereby reducing liquidity. The Fed’s balance sheet has declined 3.6% since the middle of last year.

Chairman Jerome Powell in a March press conference said the program is achieving its intended effect and the central bank doesn’t see the need to change it yet.

“And in turn, this would mean that U.S. money growth would likely face a continued headwind this year,” J.P. Morgan JPM +0.14%  strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in a note issued in February, referring to this process of quantitative tightening

The Fed’s hawkish approach marks a stark shift in policy from the pandemic era when the Fed’s bond-buying program, government stimulus checks, and extension of generous business loans, worked to juice the economy, leading to a record 27% surge in money supply in February 2021 to $19.6 trillion. Now those stimulus measures are largely over, and M2 has shrunk in turn.

But it’s important to remember that even with money supply contracting, there is still a whole lot of cash sitting around in America’s financial system.

At $21.10 trillion in February, M2 was still nearly $6 trillion higher than prepandemic levels, offering a more than adequate level of liquidity and likely still fueling some inflation including increases in prices for motor vehicle insurance, airline fares, household furnishings, and other items in March.

JPMorgan Chase reported first-quarter earnings before the opening bell Friday.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:

Adjusted earnings: $4.32 per share vs. $3.41 per share estimate

Revenue: $39.34 billion, vs. $36.19 billion

JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, will be watched closely for clues on how the industry fared after the collapse of two regional lenders last month.

Analysts expect a mixed bag of conflicting trends. For instance, JPMorgan likely benefited from an influx of deposits after Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank experienced fatal bank runs.

But the industry has been forced to pay up for deposits as customers shift holdings into higher-yielding instruments like money market funds. That will probably curb banks’ gains from rising interest rates amid the Federal Reserve’s efforts to tame inflation.

The flow of deposits through American financial institutions is the top concern of analysts and investors this quarter. That’s because smaller banks faced pressure last month as customers sought the perceived safety of megabanks including JPMorgan and Bank of America. But the bigger picture may be that deposits are leaving the regulated banking system overall as customers realize they can earn higher yields outside checking and saving accounts.

Another key question will be whether JPMorgan and others are tightening lending standards ahead of an expected U.S. recession, which could constrict economic growth this year by making it harder for consumers and businesses to borrow money.

Banks have begun setting aside more loan loss provisions on expectations for a slowing economy later this year, and that could weigh on results. JPMorgan is expected to post a $2.27 billion provision for credit losses, according to the StreetAccount estimate.

Wall Street may provide little help this quarter, with investment banking fees likely to remain subdued thanks to the still-shut IPO market. CFO Jeremy Barnum said in February that investment banking revenue was headed for a 20% decline from a year earlier, and that trading was trending “a little bit worse” as well.

Finally, analysts will want to hear what JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has to say about the economy and his expectations for how the regional banking crisis will develop. JPMorgan has played a central role in propping up a client bank, First Republic, which teetered last month, in part by leading efforts to inject it with $30 billion in deposits.

Shares of JPMorgan are down about 4% this year, outperforming the 31% decline of the KBW Bank Index.

Wells Fargo and Citigroup are scheduled to release results later Friday, while Goldman Sachs and Bank of America report Tuesday and Morgan Stanley discloses results Wednesday.",1392,111,Puginator,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12lthja/jpmorgan_chase_posts_record_revenue_that_tops/,12lthja
2023-04-13 15:33:54,r/stocks,A mild recession is bullish,"A recession is bullish because it will bring down inflation. Lower inflation will lead to an end in rate hikes. The market is forward looking, we can be in a recession and pump to the moon. So long as their is a clear pathway out of the recession, the market will pump during the recession. 

Even if you disagree, this is the mood of the market. Bearish news that brings down inflation has pumped the market on multiple occasions. Usually this happens the day after a large panic dump. I believe the market will realize the bullishness of the impending recession at market open. Futures are already green. 

Today and Friday will be an extremely powerful bullish rally. Not only because this inflation crushing recession— bank earnings are going to light the fuse to the moon. 

JPM and mega banks have received billions in new deposits. JPM especially has profited wildly from the banking crisis, yet their stock is DOWN. JPM’s ER will quell these fears that it was harmed from the crisis— a crisis that has already been canceled. 

How can the market possibly turn bearish when there is so much amazing news coming out? Inflation will be finally be killed, rate hikes will end. This has been the plan for 2 years, it’s long been priced in, this the most anticipated recession of the decade.

# **Dow closes more than 300 points lower, posts worst week since June as Silicon Valley Bank collapse sparks selloff: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks tumbled Friday as tech-focused lender Silicon Valley Bank shut down following losses in its bond portfolio, prompting the biggest bank failure since the global financial crisis and sending shockwaves through the banking sector.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped for a fourth consecutive day, finishing 345.22 points lower, or 1.07%, to close at 31,909.64. The S&amp;P 500 lost 1.45% to settle at 3,861.59. The Nasdaq Composite shed 1.76% to end at 11,138.89.
*****
&gt; All the major averages capped off the week with losses. The Dow fell 4.44% to post its worst weekly performance since June. The S&amp;P dropped 4.55%, while the Nasdaq lost 4.71%.
*****
&gt; Regulators took control of Silicon Valley Bank on Friday, after shares tumbled Thursday and the bank struggled on Friday to find another company to buy it. Regional bank stocks tumbled in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s demise, with the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF lost nearly 4.4%. For the week, the regional bank fund lost about 16%, its worst week since March 2020 as the pandemic hit.
*****
&gt; “You had a major U.S. bank collapse, the biggest bank failure since 2008, inevitably that’s going to spook the market,” said Sylvia Jablonski, CEO and chief investment officer of Defiance ETFs. The failure, she added, is also fueling concern among investors over whether the contagion spreads beyond SVB.
*****
&gt; Several bank stocks were repeatedly halted on Friday, including First Republic, PacWest and c/rypto-focused Signature Bank. First Republic dropped 14.8%, and PacWest shed 37.9%. Some bellwether bank stocks suffered smaller losses even as SVB’s fallout wreaked havoc on regional names. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America fell 4.2% and 0.9% respectively. JPMorgan held onto a 2.5% gain.
*****
&gt; “This is gamebook play, where traders and shorter term investors don’t want to be long over the weekend,” said Rich Steinberg, chief market strategist at The Colony Group.
*****
&gt; The turmoil among bank stocks overshadowed a February jobs report, which gave some hints that inflation could be slowing. Payrolls increased more than expected, but investors focused on the smaller-than-expected gain in wages, which may cause the Federal Reserve to rethink its aggressive stance on rate hikes.

&gt; # Payrolls Strong but Unemployment Rises: All Mixed Up

&gt; Another month, another solid employment report. Employment rose by 311,000 in February, on the back of 504,000 in January and 239,000 in December. It’s certainly been a warm winter. This is the labor market that refuses to give in, despite the Fed throwing almost 500 bps (5%-points) of rate hikes at it and gearing up for more.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-10-payrolls-1202x1600.png))**

&gt; # But the unemployment rate rose …
&gt; Yes, the unemployment rate rose to 3.6%, up from 3.4% in January. However, that was entirely for positive reasons.

&gt; The unemployment rate, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measures it, is the number of people unemployed who are looking for work divided by the size of the labor force. Last month, the number of unemployed people that are looking for work rose by about 240,000. However, that’s because 419,000 people “entered” the labor force, i.e., started looking for work. That’s a sign of a healthy labor market. People will start looking for work only if they think they can get a job.

&gt; The labor force measure has issues related to how participation is measured – they count someone as being in the labor force only if someone is looking for work. But a lot of people may not do so for any number of reasons, including not feeling confident in the job market or non-economic reasons like not having access to childcare. The measure also can fall over time because of a lot of retiring baby-boomers.

&gt; One way to get around these issues is to look at the employment-population ratio for prime age workers, i.e., workers aged 25-54 years. This measures the number of people working as a percent of the civilian population – think of it as the opposite of the unemployment rate, and because we use prime age, you get around the demographic issue as well.

&gt; The good news is that the prime-age employment-population ratio just hit 80.5%, which is close to the highest level we’ve seen in a couple of decades.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-10-e-pop-ratio-1203x1600.png))**

&gt; It helps to recall that we just had a multi-generational black swan event in the form of a pandemic. But once everything re-opened, the expectation was that things would bounce back immediately. And a lot of numbers did, including GDP, employment, and consumption.

&gt; However, there were also a lot of people who left the labor force amid the pandemic. And what we’re seeing now is that each month there’s a continuous flow of people back into the labor force, and these people are finding jobs quickly. Just over the past six months, 1.5 million more people have come into the labor force as prospects for finding a job improve.

&gt; Make no mistake, this is a really strong labor market in my opinion.

&gt; # Is the labor market too strong?
&gt; It’s weird to even ask that question, but it matters for the Federal Reserve. In their model for the economy, they see a tight labor market as one that results in stronger wage growth. And strong wage growth can drive demand higher, pushing up prices and inflation.

&gt; Well, hopefully, they can rest a little easy on that front. Average hourly earnings rose just 0.2% in February. Over the past three months, wages have been growing at an annualized pace of 3.6%, well below the 6%+ pace we saw last year. It’s getting very close to the pre-pandemic pace of 3.1%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-10-ahe-3m-change-1212x1600.png))**

&gt; This backs up other evidence that wage growth is indeed easing, including the Employment Cost Index, which is the gold standard of wage growth measures. The ECI was running at an annualized pace of 4.2% in Q4 2022, down from 4.8% in Q3. The January-February hourly earnings data suggest that wage growth continues to decelerate.

&gt; The big question is whether the Fed buys this. Powell’s comments this week in front of Congress did not inspire confidence. It looks like a string of hot economic data has left them questioning their decision to ease the pace of rate increases from 50 bps to 25 bps (as of February) – and wondering if they should move that back up to 50 bps at their March meeting. At this point, markets think the outcome is a coin toss, which is not great as Powell simply injected maximum uncertainty into markets.

&gt; But looking beyond the Fed’s March meeting, the big picture is that the labor market appears to remain really strong. This means the economy also remains strong, and that’s not a bad thing as far as markets are concerned. Though it also means the Fed is likely to keep interest rates higher for longer.

*****

&gt; # Panic! At the Fed?

&gt; Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments this week during his semi-annual testimony in front of Congress did not inspire much confidence with respect to the path for monetary policy. It seems like Fed officials’ are confused as to what they want to do next.

&gt; Case in point: last month, Powell said that the “disinflationary process has started.”

&gt; Since then, we’ve had a run of strong economic data, including January payrolls, retail sales, and inflation. And it looks like that was enough to spook the Fed. The shift was clear in Powell’s statements this week:

&gt; “Inflationary pressures are running higher than expected at the time of our previous Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.”

&gt; And

&gt; “The ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated.”

&gt; At the same time, he also said:

&gt; “If – and I stress that no decision has been made on this — if the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes.”

&gt; Markets were clearly taken aback by his comments, with equities falling 1.5% on Tuesday (March 7th) and rate hike expectations rising.

&gt; This becomes clear if you look at expectations for their March meeting. Last Friday, markets were expecting a 0.25% increase in the federal funds rate, pricing the probability of that at 72%.

&gt; That’s shifted significantly since Powell’s comments this week. Investors moved the probability of a 0.25% increase down to 28%, and the probability of a 0.50% increase rose to almost 80%.

&gt; This is a huge shift, especially this close to a meeting. Typically, the couple of weeks prior to the meeting is a “quiet period,” where Fed officials don’t give speeches or comments, i.e., anything that may lead to a shift in expectations. The last time this happened was in June 2022, when the Wall Street Journal reported that the Fed was considering raising rates by 0.75% instead of the 0.50% they guided markets toward.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-09-March-rate-hike-expectations-1202x1600.png))**

&gt; # There’s not much reason to panic
&gt; To be clear, the January data was hotter than expected. But this is just one month of data and is likely a rebound from the relatively soft December data (which, at the time, led to increased recession calls) and perhaps positive weather-related effects.

&gt; We’re yet to get February data, but it’s hard to believe the string of hot data continues into February and March.

&gt; Take vehicle sales, for example. Sales surged 19% in January to a 15.9 million annualized pace, the highest since May 2021. But sales pulled back to 14.9 million in February. So the trend is still positive, but nothing suggests that the economy is overheating to the extent that the Fed has to up-end market expectations for upcoming policy.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-09-auto-sales.png))**

&gt; The Carson Investment Research team has been in the camp that the economy will avoid a recession this year. As we’ve discussed before, we believe consumers are in good shape, and real incomes are rising, which should keep consumption humming along.

&gt; This gets to the point that we don’t see the Fed cutting rates any time soon. Expectations for the terminal rate, i.e., the highest rate the Fed will get to, also rose this week. At the beginning of the year, investors expected the terminal rate to end up around 4.9%. That’s now increased to about 5.6% on the back of strong economic data.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-09-rate-expectations-1202x1600.png))**

&gt; The good news is that, at the end of the day, positive economic data is positive. This perhaps explains why equities have remained resilient this year. The S&amp;P 500 is up just under 4% year-to-date, despite rate expectations repricing higher.

&gt; That’s a big shift from last year and a positive one. And we believe equities have the potential to remain resilient, even as the economic data (and the Fed) swing back and forth.

&gt; # This Doesn't Happen Often

&gt; After a surge earlier this week that took the yield on the two-year US Treasury up above 5% for the first time since 2007, concerns over the health of bank balance sheets have caused a sharp reversal lower. From a closing high of 5.07% on Wednesday, the yield on the two-year US Treasury has plummeted to 4.62% and is on pace for its largest two-day decline since September 2008. Remember that?

&gt; A 45 basis point (bps) two-day decline in the two-year yield has been extremely uncommon over the last 46 years. Of the 79 prior occurrences, two-thirds occurred during recessions, and the only times that a move of this magnitude did not occur either within six months before or after a recession were during the crash of 1987 (10/19 and 10/20) as well as 10/13/89 when the leveraged buyout of United Airlines fell through, resulting in a collapse of the junk bond market. As you can see from the New York Times headline the day after that 1989 plunge, just as investors are worrying today over whether we're in for a repeat of the Financial Crisis, back then they were looking at 'troubling similarities' to the 1987 crash. The year that followed the October 1989 decline wasn't a particularly positive period for equities, but a repeat of anything close to the 1987 crash never materialized.

Six of eleven sectors are actually oversold (&gt;1 standard deviation below 50-DMA), with Financials (XLF) and Health Care (XLV) at ""extreme oversold"" levels. XLF had been up more than 8% on the year about a month ago, but it's now down 1.93% YTD.

&gt; Technology (XLK) and Utilities (XLU) are the only two sectors up over the last week. Interestingly, Utilities (XLU) has been one of the worst performing sectors so far this year, while Tech has been the best.

&gt; With Financials seeing such a sharp decline this week, below is a snapshot of various banks and brokers in the sector with the ones highlighted in red all now trading at least 5% below their 50-DMA. As shown, Charles Schwab (SCHW) is down the most over the last week with a decline of 12.6%, which has left it 16.4% below its 50-DMA and down nearly 20% on the year. Other names like Bank of America (BAC), JP Morgan (JPM), and Raymond James (RJF) are in extreme oversold territory as well. Of the major banks and brokers listed, Goldman Sachs (GS) has actually held up the best over the last week with a decline of just 2%.

&gt; # Bearish Sentiment Remains

&gt; The S&amp;P 500's swings higher and then lower over the past week have left sentiment little changed. For the American Association of Individual Investors' (AAII) weekly survey, 24.8% of respondents reporting as bullish compared to 23.4% the previous week. That is the second higher reading in a row but still well below the recent high of 37.5% from one month ago.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; Along with a modest bounce in bullishness, bearish sentiment has taken a modest decline falling from a recent high of 44.8% last week down to 41.7% today. That is the first decline in a month, leaving it in the middle of its range since the start of last year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; Given the moves in bullish and bearish sentiment, the bull-bear spread remains skewed in favor of bears for the third week in a row.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-3.png))**

&gt; Following a sharp eight percentage point decline last week, neutral sentiment has bounced rising to 33.4%. Albeit higher, outside of last week, that reading would be the lowest since the end of 2022.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/030923-AAII-4.png))**

&gt; Although recent weeks have seen the AAII survey return to deeply bearish sentiment, other surveys are not nearly as pessimistic. While the AAII survey's bull-bear spread sits well over a standard deviation below its historical average, the NAAIM Exposure index continues to show only modestly long positioning among active managers. Currently, that reading is 0.2 standard deviations below the historical norm. Meanwhile, the weekly Investors Intelligence survey is actually showing respondents are reporting as more bullish than has been historically normal.

&gt; # A Closer Look at Seasonality

&gt; We talked a lot about how February (especially the second half of February) could be a potential break for stocks, well the good news is that we now see many signs of better times potentially coming soon.

&gt; Here’s what the average year for the S&amp;P 500 looks like. Looking at the chart below, the blue line shows gains from January through April, and November and December are normal. It is the middle part of the year that stocks tend to struggle.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-164.png))**

&gt; Lately, things look a little different. Looking at only the past 20 years showed that stocks tended to bottom in March. This is likely due to major bear market lows taking place during this month in 2003, 2009, and 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-273.jpg))**

&gt; We’ve shared before that pre-election years tend to be strong for stocks, lower only twice going back to World War II and up nearly 17% on average, making this historically the strongest year of the 4-year Presidential cycle. Looking at these years it is once again common to see the second half of February weakness and a tradeable low in late February.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-321.jpg))**

&gt; Building on this, we found that pre-election years of a new President do even better, up close to 20% on average. But wouldn’t you know it, right about now tended to be a consolidation period before late March and April strength.

&gt; What about years that started off with big gains? When stocks gained more than 5% in January (like 2023) we found that a consolidation period took place now and into April. The good news is that eventual gains of close to 23% on average were how things ended up, suggesting any potential consolidation here could potentially be used as an opportunity.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-599.png))**

&gt; Lastly, I’ve seen other places combine many of the things I’ve just discussed and make one composite combining them all. I did that and we called it the Carson Cycle Composite. This proprietary composite looks at the average year, pre-election years, pre-election years under a new President, the past 20 years, and years that had a 5% January. As you can see, this year started off stronger, but as of early March is right in line with what the average composite looks like. Take note, a gain of 15.6% is what has been the average Carson Cycle Composite.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/blog-640.png))**

&gt; The bottom line is many cycles suggest the potential for some type of a consolidation here and now would be perfectly normal, but the likelihood of strength before the end of the year is quite strong.

2023-02-27 01:23:48,r/stocks,Education - P/E &amp; Price to Free Cash Flow,"Hello,

I am starting this topic for education purposes only. I recently learned about P/E ratio and the Price to Free Cash Flow ratio. With that knowledge, I looked up two organizations to compare and practice what I learned (so far):

* JPM (JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; CO) :
   * P/E ratio of 11.67 and FCF ratio of $36.12
      * FCF pulled from seeking alpha
* BAC (Bank of America)
   * P/E ratio 10.72 and FCF ratio of -$0.78
      * FCF pulled from seeking alpha

With the above figures, would the educated investor assume that JPM is the healthier financial organization and therefore, it is the more lucrative option for investment? Are there other factors to be evaluated/reviewed?  


Edit bonus question:

How to think about the Debit to Asset ratio?  How much debt is good for growth and how much is too dangerous? Is there such a line to be aware of? ",25,15,Minions89,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11cxn2a/education_pe_price_to_free_cash_flow/,11cxn2a

* The market underestimates the long-term opportunity in SOFI and doesn't understand the technical aspect of the business.
* In 2022, Mr. Noto acquired an additional 2.15 million shares of SOFI, with his 2 largest purchases coming at the end of 2022.
* In total, Mr. Noto has purchased 2,175,557 shares with his personal capital since SOFI went public for $11,272,863.44
* It will be increasingly difficult for legacy banks to compete with SOFI as cloud-based banking becomes the norm. SOFI currently offers [3.75% APY on savings and 2.5% APY](https://www.sofi.com/banking/checking-account/) on checking when members set up direct deposit. JPM is offering [0.01% APY](https://www.chase.com/personal/savings/savings-account/interest-rates) n their savings accounts, and the largest APY that [BAC offers is 0.04](https://media.bac-assets.com/DigitalDeposit_NY_NY_Tri_State_Area.pdf?cacheBuster=8627)%.
* SOFI faced tremendous adversity with its student loan business. This became a make-or-break moment, and SOFI rose to the challenge and reinvested its business from the ground up.
* SOFI is delivering and GAAP profitability is around the corner
* The question becomes, what will SOFI accomplish in 2023 and 2024 when synergies between Galileo and Technisys are recognized, student loan originations are back to normal, and the Fed Funds rate is lower, which will make purchasing homes more attractive?

#[Dow futures fall more than 200 points as bank shares decline on recession fears](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/12/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; The stock market was set to end a winning week on a sour note as JPMorgan Chase led a decline in bank shares after it warned a recession was its base case for the year.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 200 points, or 0.6%, while S&amp;P 500 futures slid 0.7%. Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.8%.
*****
&gt; JPMorgan Chase posted revenue that beat expectations, but the bank warned it was setting aside more money to cover credit losses because a “mild recession” is its “central case.” The bank posted a $2.3 billion provision for credit losses in the quarter, a 49% increase from the third quarter. The stock fell more than 2%.
*****
&gt; Wells Fargo shares fell 2% after the bank reported its quarterly figures. Bank of America also fell 2% premarket despite reporting better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter.
*****
&gt; Delta Air Lines also reported earnings and revenue that beat estimates for the final quarter of 2022. However, the stock slid more than 5% in the premarket.
*****
&gt; Investors have been awaiting these results to gain more insight into the health of the economy.
*****
&gt; “As the tug-of-war among analysts intensifies around the prospects for a recession — and the depth of a recession — the earnings reports from the banks, coupled with their guidance, should help clarify how businesses and consumers are managing,” said Quincy Krosby, LPL Financial’s chief global strategist.
*****
&gt; The moves followed a positive day for the three major indexes. The Nasdaq Composite snatched its fifth day of gains — a first since July. Stocks rose broadly as December’s CPI report showed prices declined 0.1% over November. While prices rose at a 6.5% pace compared to the previous year, the results heightened hopes that the Federal Reserve may soon slow its hiking.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 216.96 points, or 0.64%. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite gained 0.34% and 0.64%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Stocks are headed for a winning week, with the Nasdaq and S&amp;P on pace for their best weekly performance since November. The Nasdaq is up 4.09% through Thursday’s close. The S&amp;P has advanced 2.26%, while the Dow has added 1.66%.

2023-01-13 13:15:40,r/stocks,JPM earnings look strong but headwinds still persist,"JPM looks to have beaten estimates on both revenue and earnings, with a strong rise in profits. But investment bank revenue is sharply down and may remain a headwind through 2023. Right now stock is down premarket despite seemingly strong results. 

It looks like traditional banking services are propping up weak performances from the investment bank.

2023-01-12 20:21:09,r/stocks,"JPMorgan shutters website it paid $175 million for, accuses founder of inventing millions of accounts","[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/12/jpmorgan-chase-shutters-student-financial-aid-website-frank.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/12/jpmorgan-chase-shutters-student-financial-aid-website-frank.html)

[JPMorgan Chase](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JPM/) on Thursday shut down the [website](https://withfrank.org/) for a college financial aid platform it bought for $175 million after alleging the company’s founder created nearly 4 million fake customer accounts.

The country’s biggest bank acquired Frank in September 2021 to help it deepen relationships with college students, a key demographic, [a Chase executive told CNBC at the time](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/21/jpmorgan-chase-is-buying-college-financial-aid-platform-frank.html).

JPMorgan touted the deal as giving it the “[fastest-growing](https://media.chase.com/news/jp-morgan-chase-acquires-frank#:~:text=New%20York%2C%20NY%20%E2%80%93%20September%2021,journey%20to%20college%20and%20beyond.) college financial planning platform” used by more than 5 million students at 6,000 institutions. It also provided access to the startup’s founder, [Charlie Javice](https://www.crainsnewyork.com/awards/40-under-40-2019-charlie-javice), who joined the New York-based bank as part of the acquisition.

Months after the transaction closed, JPMorgan said it learned the truth after sending out marketing emails to a batch of 400,000 Frank customers. About 70% of the emails bounced back, the bank said in a [lawsuit filed last month](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-11/jpmorgan-says-it-was-defrauded-in-175-million-frank-acquisition) in federal court.

Javice, who had approached JPMorgan in mid-2021 about a potential sale, lied to the bank about her startup’s scale, the bank alleged. Specifically, after being pressed for confirmation of Frank’s customer base during the due diligence process, Javice used a data scientist to invent millions of fake accounts, according to JPMorgan.

“To cash in, Javice decided to lie, including lying about Frank’s success, Frank’s size, and the depth of Frank’s market penetration in order to induce JPMC to purchase Frank for $175 million,” the bank said. “Javice represented in documents placed in the acquisition data room, in pitch materials, and through verbal presentations \[that\] more than 4.25 million students had created Frank accounts.”

Instead of gaining a business with 4.25 million students, JPMorgan had one with “fewer than 300,000 customers,” JPMorgan said in the suit.

## Frank emails

In the suit, JPMorgan alleged that Javice first asked her engineering chief to create “fake customer details” using algorithms. When he refused, she found a data science professor at a New York-area college to create the accounts, the lender said.

The bank included incriminating emails between the unnamed professor and Javice in its suit.

For instance, Javice had allegedly asked the professor, “Will the fake emails look real with an eye check or better to use unique ID?” 

JPMorgan had access to the emails because it had acquired Frank’s technology systems as part of the acquisition, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.

## Javice’s defense

A lawyer for Javice told The Wall Street Journal that JPMorgan had “manufactured” reasons to fire her late last year to avoid paying millions of dollars owed to her. Javice has sued JPMorgan, saying the bank should front legal bills she incurred during its internal investigations.

“After JPM rushed to acquire Charlie’s rocketship business, JPM realized they couldn’t work around existing student privacy laws, committed misconduct and then tried to retrade the deal,” attorney Alex Spiro [told the Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/jpmorgan-bought-college-financial-aid-platform-for-175-millionand-now-says-most-of-its-users-were-fake-11673470572). “Charlie blew the whistle and then sued.”

Spiro, a partner at Quinn Emanuel, didn’t immediately return a call from CNBC.

JPMorgan spokesman Pablo Rodriguez had this response:

“Our legal claims against Ms. Javice and Mr. Amar are set out in our complaint, along with the key facts,” he said. “Ms. Javice was not and is not a whistleblower. Any dispute will be resolved through the legal process.”

## ‘Pinch me’

The alleged fraud perpetrated by Javice and one of her executives “materially damaged JPMC in an amount to be proven at trial, but not less than $175 million,” JPMorgan said in its suit.

Regardless of the outcome of this legal scuffle, this is an embarrassing episode for JPMorgan and its CEO, [Jamie Dimon.](https://www.cnbc.com/jamie-dimon/) In a bid to fend off encroaching competitors, JPMorgan has gone on a [buying spree of fintech companies in recent years](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/12/jpmorgan-jpm-fintech-deal-to-acquire-renovite-to-battle-stripe-and-block.html), and Dimon has repeatedly defended his technology investments as necessary ones that will yield good returns.

The fact that a [young founder](https://www.crainsnewyork.com/awards/40-under-40-2019-charlie-javice) in an industry [known for shaky metrics](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/28/fintech-startups-2022-2023-a-reckoning-is-upon-us-heres-what-to-expect.html) and a “fake it ’til you make it” ethos managed to allegedly dupe JPMorgan calls into question how stringent the bank’s due diligence process is.

In an interview at the time of the deal, Javice marveled at how far she had come in just a few years leading her startup.

“Today is my first day employed by someone else, ever,” Javice told CNBC. “I mean it still feels very much like, pinch me, did this really happen?”

As a result of the legal scuffle, JPMorgan shut down Frank early Thursday morning.

# [Stock futures are little changed after Monday’s rout](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/05/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed Tuesday, as traders took a breather after fears of even higher rates sparked a sell-off during the previous session.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 20 points higher, or 0.06%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures rose marginally higher.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq Composite led Monday’s downward charge, dropping 1.93% for its biggest one-day drop since Nov. 9. The S&amp;P 500 shed 1.79%, also notching its worst day in nearly a month. The Dow, meanwhile, lost 482 points, or 1.4%.
*****
&gt; Better-than-expected November ISM Services data, which looks at the purchasing level of manufacturers as a gauge the health of the broader economy, pressured equities Monday. The report stoked fears that the Federal Reserve will need to hike rates for longer than anticipated to bring down inflation. The release aligns with the payrolls report late last week in pointing to resilience within some areas of the economy.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is largely expecting a 50 basis point increase to interest rates at the Fed’s December meeting, but remain conflicted over how long the central bank’s interest rate hiking campaign will need to last, especially given the latest data.
*****
&gt; Despite this backdrop, markets could still move higher in the months ahead, even though slowing growth and higher rates will persist even into the new year, wrote Jason Draho, UBS’ head of asset allocation, in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; “A year-end rally may still be in the offing, though investors are likely to remain skittish until November CPI is released on the 13th and the FOMC meeting concludes on the 14th,” he said. “If there are no surprises with these events, momentum could continue.”
*****
&gt; Investors will look ahead to data Tuesday morning on international trade for insight into the strength of the U.S. and global economy. Later in the day, they will watch for post-bell earnings reports from Smith &amp; Wesson and Stitch Fix.

**2022 S&amp;P 500 Predictions**

Every year, Wall Streets’s top strategist make a call of where they think the S&amp;P 500 will finish. We wanted to share a summary of some of these target prices for 2022 and the strategist reasoning for it. Remember to take these predictions with a grain of salt as markets are hardly predictable no matter how much of an “expert” you are.

**Morgan Stanley**

**Target Price-4,400**

**2022 performance: -7.7%**

While the firm still expects solid EPS growth next year, “uncertainty around that expectation goes up materially given cost pressures, supply issues, along with tax and policy uncertainty that is unique to the U.S.,” the analysts wrote in the note. With the rest of the world having lagged the U.S. recovery, the firm sees more “catch up” potential elsewhere and less earnings volatility over the next 12 months.

While Morgan Stanley does expect earnings for the S&amp;P 500 overall to be solid, chief U.S. equity strategist Michael Wilson expects “significant” earnings dispersion at the stock level, making the year more about stocks than sectors or styles.

**Wells Fargo**

**Target Price-5,200**

**2022 Performance: 9.1%**

Persistent supply shortages and inflation pressures lead us to adjust the magnitudes of some 2022 targets, but we believe the global economy should still mark an above-average pace next year. More importantly, our tactical preferences for the next 6 to 18 months are nearly all unchanged.

**Goldman Sachs**

**Target price-5,100**

**2022 Performance: 7%**

“Decelerating economic growth, a tightening Fed, and rising real yields suggest investors should expect modestly below-average returns next year.”

“In contrast with our expectation during the past year, corporate tax rates will likely remain unchanged in 2022 and rise in 2023. Corporate earnings will grow and lift share prices. The equity bull market will continue.”

“While we remain vigilant on margins, we don’t think it makes sense to assume the worst on this front given the strong track record that companies have had managing through cost pressures even before the pandemic.”

**Credit Suisse**

**Target Price-5200**

**2022 Performance: 9.1%**

“This constructive outlook is based on robust projections for economic growth in both real and nominal terms, further margin upside in cyclical groups, a pickup in buybacks and a favorable discount rate despite Fed tightening.”

**JP Morgan**

**Target Price-5,050**

**2022 Performance: 5.7%**

A JPM team led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, chief U.S. equity strategist, sees further stock upside ahead, albeit more moderate, on better-than-expected earnings growth, easing supply shocks, improved background on China (which JPM upgraded to overweight on expectations for policy easing and as equity risk premiums from regulatory moves are priced in) and emerging markets, normalizing consumer spending habits and, most important, accommodative central banks.

**BMO Capital Markets**

**Target Price-5,300**

**2022 Performance: 10.97%**

The bank believes that investors are too focused on inflation, which should moderate as supply chain kinks get straightened out next year. Combined with solid corporate earnings, that should continue to drive stocks higher in 2022, BMO analysts said. What’s more, the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet “will remain very large for quite some time, which should continue to be supportive of stocks.”

**RBC Capital Markets**

**Target Price-5050**

**2022 performance: 5.7%**

Like JPMorgan, the firm sees a slight gain for stocks in 2022, with heightened concern over rising Covid cases yet to derail the bull market. The new omicron variant is a reason for investors to “proceed with caution but not to panic,” RBC analysts said in a recent note.

# **S&amp;P 500 closes higher on Friday, but ends week with losses - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/17/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; The major averages ticked higher in afternoon trading Friday to end the day on an upbeat note as investors assessed tougher language from Federal Reserve speakers and pored over the latest earnings reports.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 199.37 points, or 0.59%, to 33,745.69, while the S&amp;P 500 climbed 0.48% to 3,965.34. The Nasdaq Composite finished just 0.01% above the flat line at 11,146.06.
*****
&gt; All of the major averages posted losses for the week. The Dow ended 0.01% lower. The S&amp;P 500 lost 0.69% for the week, while the Nasdaq ended 1.57% lower. All three indexes are positive for the month, however.
*****
&gt; The market was divided for much of the day, with the S&amp;P 500 trading mostly flat as investors started to reset expectations after a couple of rallies over the past week, beginning with the October CPI print. Stephanie Lang, chief investment officer at Homrich Berg, said this week is characterized by a “back-to-reality viewpoint.”
*****
&gt; “Following the big rally coming off the better-than-expected CPI print, the market’s digesting the current data, which is bringing things back to reality,” she said. “The rally that followed the CPI print we don’t feel was justified by fundamentals… The market’s also pricing in a soft landing here, which we don’t think is likely to occur. So when you hear the Fed officials coming out and reiterating their stance, you’re starting to see the market readjust to that.”
*****
&gt; On Friday, Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins expressed confidence that policymakers can tame inflation without doing too much damage to employment.
*****
&gt; St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said Thursday that “the policy rate is not yet in a zone that may be considered sufficiently restrictive.” He suggested that the appropriate zone for the federal funds rate could be in the 5% to 7% range, which is higher than what the market is pricing.
*****
&gt; ""We continue to think investors should place much more emphasis on the actual data and not focus too much on Fed rhetoric (the former will show where inflation is headed while the latter is fixated on where it was),” said Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge. “That said, investors are tired of battling the Fed’s daily tape bombs and the fear is it may take 2-3 more CPIs for officials to stop admonishing the market every time it tries to rally.”

&gt; # Do Stocks Really Like Gridlock?

&gt; The midterm elections are over, and the results aren’t 100% official yet, but we do know that we’ll have a divided government. As of now, the Democrats have 50 seats in the Senate to maintain control there, while the Republicans gained their 218th seat in the House to take control there. The bottom line though is neither the Senate nor the House has large majorities, in fact, they are both near historically small margins.

&gt; So that’s the big question, do stocks really like gridlock? Of course, things are never this simple, as there are so many other factors that matter to how stocks do, but it sure looks like gridlock could be a tailwind for stocks. Or at the very least, not a major headwind.

&gt; Here’s a chart that shows all the times since 1950 we’ve had a divided government and how the S&amp;P 500 did in those years. The average return for stocks was a very solid 15.7% under a divided government, with only one-year falling significantly back in 1981, while 2011 was nearly exactly breakeven. The other years saw some solid returns.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-176-800x297.png))**

&gt; As of now, it is expected the Republicans will take a three-seat majority in the House (this could change, but it’ll likely be near this number). This would be the smallest majority for the Republicans since 3 seats in 2001 and 2002. Here’s a great chart that shows just how rare it is to have a majority this small. Fun stat, the House moved to 435 seats in 1913, meaning 218 seats gives a party the majority. Fun stat #2, the Democrats controlled the House from 1955 to 1994, but things have been more even over recent years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-2-800x357.png))**

&gt; What exactly does a small-seat majority in the House mean? Odds are a small majority means there could be some gridlock, so do stocks like this? Below we show again this appears to be the case. When there is less than a 20-seat House majority, the S&amp;P 500 gained a median of 19.5% and was higher 12 out of 15 times when looking at the first year of a new Congress. In fact, 9 of the past 10 times there was a new Congress and a small majority, stocks finished higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-3-800x485.png))**

&gt; In conclusion, stocks really do appear to have no issues with a divided government and in many cases, stocks have done just fine under this scenario.

&gt; # Weakness Sets Up Bullish Thanksgiving Week/End-November Trade

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/983481ddc26e9faf09d4cbe60d182136/4dd2ef76a33815cb-d4/s500x750/221168352745363465f01d3a3261a2773c0690ab.jpg))**

&gt; The recent 21-year typical November graph here points to a seasonal cycle low point tomorrow, the 14th trading day of the month, the Friday before Thanksgiving and Op-Ex day. Thanksgiving week has a notorious “holiday fueled” bullish bias as do the last seven trading days of the month.

&gt; However, as you can see from the tables here of the history of the Thanksgiving trade the bullish bias has weakened over the last several years. The best short-term trade appears to be getting long into any weakness in the week or days before the holiday and selling any subsequent rally toward the end of Thanksgiving week or before month-end.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/afaf374bbaec07b073fabd03723ff324/4dd2ef76a33815cb-44/s500x750/bd219c6246d1918c7fc0bcee7ae9be9dd623cb64.jpg))**

&gt; First published in the 1987 Stock Trader’s Almanac, the Wednesday before and the Friday after Thanksgiving combined were up 34 times in 35 years. The only S&amp;P 500 decline was in 1964. Subsequently, this trend changed. In the 35 years since 1987, there have been 10 declines and 25 advances. See 2023 Stock Trader’s Almanac page 106 for more.

&gt; # Highest Bullish Sentiment of the Year

&gt; As we noted last week, this week's sentiment data is the first to encapsulate any reaction to last week's CPI number as well as the subsequent market rally. Although price action has been somewhat choppy and there have been plenty of other catalysts (FTX's collapse, more yield curve inversions, the missile strike in Poland) to balance out the inflation data and put investors back onto their heels, the latest AAII survey has shown a surge in bullish sentiment. The percentage of respondents reporting as optimistic jumped from 25.1% last week up to 33.5% this week. That is not only the largest one-week increase since the first week of June (when bulls rose by 12.2 percentage points) but is now the highest reading on bulls since the last week of 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111722-Sentiment-1.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment in turn dropped sharply falling to 40.2% for a decline of 6.8 percentage points. While an improvement, at the start of the month bearish sentiment had fallen by much more (both the last week of October and the first week of November saw double-digit week-over-week declines) and was at a much lower level of 32.9%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111722-Sentiment-2.png))**

&gt; The bull-bear spread has narrowed but still remains negative for the 33rd week in a row. If the spread remains negative into next week, it will tie the record streak from 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111722-Sentiment-3.png))**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111722-Sentiment-6.png))**

&gt; Neutral sentiment fell for a second week in a row with the total decline in that time eclipsing 10 percentage points. At 26.3%, it is down to the lowest level since the week of October 20th, implying that investors have become a bit more decisive in their respective market views.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111722-Sentiment-4.png))**

&gt; The AAII survey's more bullish turn this week was also seen in other readings on sentiment like the Investors Intelligence survey and the NAAIM Exposure Index. As a result, our sentiment composite which aggregates the findings of the three surveys into a single sentiment reading is back up to its highest reading since mid-August. Although the reading remains negative, it is no longer at the extreme levels that were common earlier this year.

&gt; # Consumer Discretionary's Muddled Relative Strength

&gt; Ranging from today's retail sales report to homebuilder sentiment to the earnings of some of the largest retailers like Target (TGT) and Lowe's (LOW), the economic and earnings calendar this week has given Consumer Discretionary stocks plenty of news to digest. Outside of the spring to late summer, the sector has generally been on the decline relative to the S&amp;P 500 in 2022. Last week, that relative strength line bounced right as it reached the late May low. However, over the past few days, it has been resuming its move lower, meaning it is back to underperforming.

&gt; While on a sector level the relative strength line has been falling, drilling down to the industry group level, there has been more variation. For example, even with some positive responses to earnings from the likes of Home Depot (HD) or Lowe's (LOW), the retailing industry has seen a sharp grind lower in its relative strength line versus the S&amp;P 500. Similarly, autos have seen a turn lower although it has been underperforming the S&amp;P for a longer period of time since the early fall. Meanwhile, Consumer Durables and Appliances (which includes stocks like the homebuilders and home appliance makers) has been moving higher. That move has paled in comparison to the relative strength of Consumer Services stocks (restaurants, cruise lines, hotels and resorts), though, as that group's line has surged over the past couple of months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-RSa.png))**

&gt; As mentioned above, retailers in the Consumer Discretionary sector have been underperforming the S&amp;P 500 lately but there is another group of retailers in which performance has been more solid. The Food &amp; Staples Retail industry is a component of the Consumer Staples sector, and its relative strength line has been trending higher since the spring lows. In fact, after the past week's move higher thanks in part to a strong response to Walmart (WMT) earnings, its relative strength line is approaching some of the highest levels of the past year, entirely recovering the massive drop from May in the wake of another, much more negatively received, WMT earnings report.

&gt; # How Bottoms Form. (It Might Surprise You.)

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 rallied again last week and was more than 10% off the October 12 closing lows, before selling off some yesterday. Nonetheless, the truth is the overall news really hasn’t really been that great, yet stocks have staged a strong rally over the past month. What gives?

&gt; Turns out, this is what tends to happen coming off major lows for stocks more often than not. Our friends at JPM Asset Management put together some of the best charts I’ve ever seen to describe this phenomenon. You can read the whole report from Michael Cembalest here.

&gt; They found that from the Eisenhower recession in 1957 to stagflation in the 1970s, to the early 1980s double dip recession, to the 1990 recession, stocks turned higher well before the other parts of the economy began to turn higher. As you can see below, stocks tended to bottom months (and sometimes years) before earnings, GDP, and payrolls officially turn higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-chart-166-800x527.png))**

&gt; More recently we saw similar action during the Financial Crisis and then again during the worst of COVID. I’ll never forget how stocks soared in April, May, and June of 2020, yet we saw some of the very worst headlines in our country’s history. The truth is the stock market isn’t looking in the rear-view mirror, it is always looking forward and discounting what could be out there in the future.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-chart-245-800x257.png))**

&gt; To keep things honest, this doesn’t have a perfect track record, as, after the dot-com burst, GDP and earnings both turned higher well before stocks officially bottomed.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-chart-34.png))**

&gt; This in one of the more confusing concepts for many investors, but it is one that is so important to understand. Stocks will likely rise even as the news is bad, this is how it works. If you are waiting for things to officially improve, you likely will miss out on substantial gains along the way.

&gt; Burt White likes to say if you are playing a video game and you are going toward the monsters, you are going in the right direction. Investing is similar, as times will sometimes be extra scary, but this is part of the process. If you are scared or uncomfortable, that is all part of investing in a lot of ways and if you run the other way every time things get scary, you’ll likely never be able to meet your investment goals.

&gt; # Homebuilder Hopes Demolished

&gt; The national average on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage has come back below 7%, but it remains elevated versus recent history as housing data still can't catch a break. This morning, the NAHB released their latest reading on homebuilder sentiment and for the eleventh month in a row, the headline index fell month over month. As shown below, the current streak of nearly a year straight of declines is far and away a record, surpassing two eight-month long streaks leading up to the Financial Crisis.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-NAHB-1a.png))**

&gt; This month, homebuilder sentiment dropped another 5 points down to 33. That is not the largest drop of the current streak of declines, with bigger drops of 8 points last month or 12 points in July, but it still ranks in the bottom 4% of all months on record. In other words, not only is homebuilder sentiment falling consistently, but it's falling fairly fast. The other components have also seen bottom decile declines with the only sub-index avoiding declines being in the West.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-NAHB-2.png))**

&gt; After the November decline, the headline homebuilder sentiment reading sits 3 points above the spring 2020 low. Similarly, Present Sales and Traffic are down to the lowest level since April 2020 while Future Sales have actually surpassed those levels to now sit at the weakest reading in over a decade.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-NAHB-1.png))**

&gt; Last month, we highlighted how the geographic breakdown of sentiment was showing homebuilders in the Northeast being much more optimistic than their counter parts in the rest of the country. In November, that region joined the rest of the pack with a massive 17 point decline. That ranks as the third largest monthly decline on record behind a 19 point drop in June 2010 and the 45 point decline at the onset of the pandemic in April 2020. While that has not been enough to result in a new low, similar to sentiment in the Midwest, sentiment in the South is down to the lowest level in a decade. The same could be said for the West although it rose marginally month over month.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-NAHB-3.png))**

&gt; As for the reaction of homebuilder stocks, the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB) is trading 1.1% lower as of this writing. As shown below, after last week's equity market surge on CPI in which the group moved not only above its 50-DMA but also its 200-DMA, ITB has continued to hold above its moving averages for now. Without much follow through on the post-CPI surge, any move above last week's highs would be a welcome bullish sign, whereas the 200-DMA is looking to be the critical level of support for the time being.

*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 closed out its best week since June as a report on Thursday showing slowing inflation raised hopes that the Federal Reserve would soon slow its tightening campaign.
*****
&gt; The broader market index added 0.9%, to close at 3,992.93. This brought its gain for the week to 5.9%, its best week since the one ended June 24 of this year. The Nasdaq Composite added about 1.9% to end at 11,323.33 as investors snapped up tech shares on hopes interest rates would ease. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1%, closing at 33,747.86.
*****
&gt; Tech stocks on Friday shook off a decline in cryptocurrencies. Virtual currencies tumbled sharply this week and once again came under pressure Friday after FTX filed for bankruptcy protection, and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried resigned. Bitcoin and ether both declined.
*****
&gt; Still, tech stocks and related crypto stocks rebounded after opening lower Friday. The tech sector in the S&amp;P 500 surged 10% through Friday, its best weekly performance since April 2020. Amazon was up more than 4% on Friday, while Google-parent Alphabet was 2.6% higher.
*****
&gt; The Dow jumped more than 1,200 points on Thursday following a smaller-than-expected rise in consumer prices for the month of October, giving investors hope that inflation may be cooling. The S&amp;P rose 5.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite surged about 7.4%. It was the best day since 2020 for all three indexes.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields plunged Thursday on the back of the weaker-than-expected inflation print. The bond market was closed on Friday to observe Veterans Day.
*****
&gt; “From an equity market perspective, as long as the threat of much higher rates is out the way, this should remove a major headwind,” Barclays’ head of European equity strategy Emmanuel Cau wrote in a Friday note.
*****
&gt; All of the indexes posted a winning week. The Dow was up 4.1% on a weekly basis, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 8.1%. The week marked a resumption of a comeback rally for the bear market, which began in mid-October.

&gt; # Banks and Brokers on Fire

&gt; The Financial sector ETF (XLF) has been on fire since its intraday low of $29.59 on October 13th, which was the day of the hotter than expected September CPI report. From that low point on 10/13, XLF is up 20.2%. As shown below, the ETF is currently at the very top end of a wide sideways range that has been in place over the last six months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/xlfchartuse.png))**

&gt; Below is a sampling of some of the most well-known banks and brokers that are part of the Financial sector. As shown, names like Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Jefferies (JEF), Raymond James (RJF), and Stifel (SF) are all more than 10% above their 50-DMAs, and the only stock that's not overbought (&gt;2 standard deviations above 50-DMA) is LPL Financial (LPLA), which traded lower on earnings yesterday.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/banksbrokersta.png))**

&gt; A quick look at the six-month price charts of the stocks listed in the table above gives you a glimpse into the huge rally that this area of the market has experienced since early October. Investors have seemingly been loading up on them with short-term Treasury yields now significantly higher than the interest rates these banks and brokers are paying customers on deposits.

&gt; # Homebuilders Extended

&gt; Every day we browse through our Trend Analyzer tool (available with a Premium or Institutional membership) to monitor trends and overbought/oversold levels across financial markets. When we got to the homebuilder stocks this morning, we had to do a double-take after seeing some of the recent moves in this space. Have a look at the moves in the snapshot below. Most homebuilder stocks have rallied 12-15% over the last five trading days, leaving them in extreme overbought territory, which means they're more than two standard deviations above their 50-day moving averages. DR Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN), NVR (NVR), and PulteGroup (PHM) are the most extended. Even after the rally in these names over the last week, we'd note that they're still all down sharply year-to-date as the spike in mortgage rates from 3% up to 7%+ has caused activity in the space to slow to a crawl. A drop in those mortgage rates over the last few days was the catalyst for the recent move higher in share prices. If you're wondering which way the homebuilders are likely to trade going forward, keep an eye on interest rates -- that's the entire story these days.

&gt; # A Very Encouraging Inflation Report, Including Goods Deflation (Finally)

&gt; One month does not make a trend, but today’s consumer price index (CPI) report was very positive. Dare I say, it’s probably the best inflation report we’ve seen in about 15 months, especially because there were so many encouraging signs in it. This is a huge relief, and markets appear to be responding in kind. S&amp;P 500 futures were up more than 3% after the CPI report was released and as of lunchtime, the rally continued.

&gt; Let’s walk through it.

&gt; Headline inflation rose 0.4% in October, as expected. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food/energy prices, and is arguably more important for the Federal Reserve (Fed), surprised: rising 0.3% in October, below expectations for a 0.5% jump. This is the lowest monthly increase since September 2021.

&gt; Looking back over the past year, headline inflation is up 7.8%. That’s high but that’s come down from 9.1% in June. A big part of the deceleration was falling energy prices – you can see how the lighter red bars have been making up a smaller portion of inflation over the past few months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-10-picture-headline-inflation-decelerating-578x800.png))**

&gt; In the chart above, you can see that Food prices continue to make a big piece of inflation (dark red bars). But we got a break here as well. “Food at Home”, i.e. groceries (which make up close to 9% of the inflation basket), rose just 0.4% in October – the lowest in more than a year and well below the average 0.7% monthly increase we’ve seen over the first 9 months of the year.

&gt; # The Goods Deflation We’ve Been Waiting For
&gt; We’ve been talking about how private inflation data has been showing decelerating prices for goods outside energy and food. Just yesterday my colleague Ryan Detrick wrote about collapsing used car prices. Retailers have been telling us for a while that they’re discounting items as well. We’ve just been waiting for the official inflation data to catch up, and looks like it’s doing that, finally.

&gt; There’s a broad list of goods, including used cars, that saw prices fall in October, which is what makes it even more encouraging. The items below make up about 11% of the inflation basket (and 14% of the core basket). Falling household goods prices probably reflect the slowdown in residential activity, as home sales collapse amid higher mortgage rates.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-10-table-goods-prices.png))**

&gt; # Are Rents Breaking?
&gt; The best part about goods deflation is that it offsets high services inflation. As you can see below, the blue bars are now below the zero line for the second month in a row. We also got good news in the form of medical care services – which was a function of falling health insurance premiums.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-10-picture-core-inflation-576x800.png))**

&gt; The biggest part of the inflation basket is Shelter, including rents on primary residences and something called “Owners’ Equivalent Rent” (OER), which is the “implied rent” that owner-occupants would have to pay if they were renting their homes. The latter is also determined using rents of equivalent homes as I wrote about a month ago. In other words, OER is effectively a measure of rents, and altogether rents make up a whopping 40% of the core inflation basket.

&gt; And rents have been rising, putting a lot of upward pressure on core inflation. You can see the gray bars in the previous chart growing larger and larger over the past year.

&gt; However, market rents have been decelerating quite rapidly over the last few months – Ryan discussed this just yesterday. The problem is it hasn’t shown up in the official inflation data because of methodological reasons (we wrote about this quite extensively).

&gt; But the official rental data may be beginning to turn. Rent of primary residence rose 0.7% month-over-month and OER rose 0.6% in October, which is lower than what we’ve seen over the previous couple of months. Make no mistake, a 0.7% rise is still a lot – that translates to an annualized pace of 9%, which is why the Fed is really worried about it. But hopefully, the October data is a sign that the official data is beginning to turn and follow the private data, lower.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-10-picture-rents-private-vs-offical-599x800.png))**

&gt; # What does this mean for Fed policy
&gt; Perhaps the most important question.

&gt; As I said at the top, one month is not a trend. But this is not random. It jives with all the other leading indicators of prices, which have been showing a deceleration in prices. And now it looks like the official data is catching up.

&gt; With respect to policy, Fed officials are unlikely to change their minds based on one report. They’ll probably need to see at least three of these before starting to view it as “convincing evidence” that inflation is on its way down.

&gt; But what today’s CPI does is that it buys time. Yet another hot inflation print would have put more pressure on the Fed to raise rates even further. By coming out on the soft side, the report increases the odds for a “soft landing” scenario. In other words, inflation and wage growth can (hopefully) come down without the Fed having to ratchet rates higher and higher, which would eventually break the labor market.

&gt; # Haves and Have Nots

&gt; As evident in our Sector Snapshots over the past several days and as we discussed yesterday on Twitter, sector performance has lately been a tale of the haves and have-nots. The areas of the market that possess some of the most heavily weighted stocks, namely Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, and Technology, have drastically underperformed other cyclical sectors like Financials, Industrials, and Materials. As a result, relative strength lines have blown out. Shown another way, in the charts below, we show the ratios of each of these sectors relative to the S&amp;P 500. A rising line would indicate the sector is outperforming the broader market and vice versa.

&gt; Communication Services has been in a brutal downtrend in relative strength terms for more than a year now and the recent drop has been steep. While the ratio of Consumer Discretionary to the S&amp;P 500 has been more range bound in recent years, there have been a few wild swings in the past year. The most recent swing lower is leaving it close to the lowest levels since early 2015. Tech's decline has not been nearly as sharp, but the ratio here has nonetheless rolled over to some of the lowest levels of the past few years. Conversely, Financials, Industrials, and Materials have all seen their ratios rip higher to the upper end of the past few years' range.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110922-Ratiosa.png))**

&gt; In measuring just how sharp of moves these ratios have experienced, they have been outright historic. As for the most pronounced moves, the drops in the lines of Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary rank in the bottom percentile of all 10-day moves since 1990 when our sector data begins. The only periods in which the ratios fell by similar degrees, if not by more, were during the Dot Com bubble. While Tech's ratio is at new multi-yea rlows, its decline was large (ranking in the 17th percentile) but not nearly as sharp, standing out much less than the aforementioned sectors.

&gt; Like Tech, the moves in Financials and Materials have also been quite large and rank in the top decile of all 10-day moves, but those are far from records. The outperformance of Industrials on the other hand, has been remarkable. As of yesterday's close, the ratio versus the S&amp;P 500 rose 7.24% over the past two weeks. Only three other days—May 19 through May 21, 2020—since 1990 have seen higher readings.

&gt; # Small Business Labor and Inflation Slumping

&gt; The NFIB released its October data on small business optimism this morning. The headline index was expected to show further deterioration in optimism, and exactly that occurred as the index fell to 91.3 from last month's reading of 92.1 versus expectations of 91.4. This month's reading is off of the spring lows which had surpassed the worst levels from the early stages of the pandemic but remains one of the weakest readings of the past several years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-1.png))**

&gt; In the table below, we provide a breakdown of each category of the report. The headline index is now just off the bottom decile of readings as most components are likewise historically depressed. While the report was weak, there were some exceptions with strong showings in labor market metrics like Plans to Increase Employment, Job Openings Hard to Fill, and Compensation.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-Table.png))**

&gt; Even though these labor market metrics have remained at very high levels from a historical perspective, they have largely been rolling over for the better portion of the past year. Hiring plans as well as the percentage of firms reporting cost or quality of labor as their biggest issues are back to similar levels as the year prior to the pandemic. Meanwhile, actual employment changes are negative (as they have been throughout the pandemic) implying businesses are reporting a net decline in workers. That is in spite of still elevated compensation and a sharp spike higher in compensation plans. In fact, that index is just shy of the peak from the final months of 2021 after a record 9-point month-over-month jump. Companies are also reporting job openings remain hard to fill, although that index has also been on the decline alongside hiring plans. This month, the reading was unchanged at 46, the lowest level since June 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-2.png))**

&gt; Sales components have experienced far greater degrees of deterioration than employment metrics. The outlook for general business conditions has rallied back somewhat in the past few months, but it remains well below its historical range. Given the weakness in small businesses' economic outlook, few report now as an opportune time to expand their businesses. Actual sales changes dropped to -8 in October which matched August for the weakest showing for sales since August 2020. Back in 2020 though, this index was far lower than it is now.

&gt; While the reading on the top line has held up relatively well, high inflation has meant the bottom line has taken a big hit. A net 30% of small businesses reported earnings have fallen. That reading did improve last month, though, as there have been fewer businesses reporting higher prices. In spite of those improvements, each of those indices has a long way to go until returning to what have historically been more normal levels.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-3.png))**

&gt; As mentioned above, a historically low share of businesses are reporting positive sentiment on the economy and that has dampened their hopes of expansion. When questioned on the reason for not expanding, 44% reported economic conditions as the reason. Another 17% reported economic conditions as the reason for uncertainty on whether or not they would expand. Aptly coming out on Election Day, we have highlighted in the past the political nature of the NFIB survey. As such, it should come as little surprise that the next biggest reason for small business hesitancy in expanding has been the political climate. Assuming the survey results react to the current election in a similar way as in the past, a strong election showing for Republicans could provide a boost to small business sentiment and plans for expansion. Finally, given continued high inflation and rates rising to combat it, the next two most widely mentioned reasons to not expand were the cost of expansion and financial conditions and interest rates with a combined 9% of responses.

&gt; # What's Bothering Small Businesses?

&gt; As we noted in an earlier post, the pandemic trends of tight labor markets and high inflation continue to show up in the latest NFIB survey of small business optimism, albeit readings have begun to roll over. The survey also questions firms on what they perceive to be their most pressing problems. Perhaps even more than the other indices in the report, the results of these questions have shown how front and center labor and inflation concerns continue to be.

&gt; As shown below, most problems have seen record or near-record lows. Meanwhile, two-thirds of responses report either cost or quality of labor or inflation as their biggest problem.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-MIP-Table.png))**

&gt; At 33%, inflation as the single most important problem has well surpassed the previous record high set during what was a much less dramatic inflationary spell in 2008. Although this reading rose 3 percentage points versus September, it is in the middle of the past few months' range. In other words, inflation is slightly less of a concern than it was a few months ago (which is confirmed by the decline in the higher prices index), but that is certainly not to say it is no longer the single most pressing problem.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-MIP-1.png))**

&gt; Another third of responses reported either cost or quality of labor as their biggest issues. Quality is the bigger concern of the two—which is normal from a historical perspective—accounting for a 23% share.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-MIP-4.png))**

&gt; As we frequently note, the NFIB survey has a tendency to be impacted by politics with a bias towards Republican administrations. For example, during the Bush and Trump years, there was a far lower share of respondents reporting government requirements and taxes as their biggest concerns. With the prominence of inflation, Biden's tenure has resulted in a different scenario in which these issues have been placed on the back burner. Granted, these issues still account for the most pressing problem of a combined 17% of responses. We would also note, these readings have seen some dramatic moves around midterm election months, but those have not always been lasting.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-MIP-2a.png))**

&gt; Finally, we would note that very few businesses (only 3%) are worried about poor sales. That is a record-low share and unchanged for the third month in a row. As we noted in our discussion of the other areas of the report, that lack of concern for the top line contrasts with businesses' hopes for expansion and the outlook for the economy. In fact, of the reasons given for firms reporting now as not a good time to expand, sales prospects were the least pressing reason given.

&gt; # Beyond the Midterm Elections…Less Uncertainty and Historically Solid S&amp;P 500 Performance

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a5f6008c34de7421fb4219e162491342/1e76828c24e4974c-2b/s500x750/6ec4edf19bebdc462cd466a8ca166dc72a5e9eaa.jpg))**

&gt; It is finally Election Day and hopefully soon the results will start rolling in. Once the outcome is known, it will likely alleviate some of the uncertainty that has been contributing to the market’s volatile trading which could help the market snap out of its Fed-induced funk. In the chart above the 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the last 18 midterm-year elections appear (NASDAQ since 1974). Prior to 1969 the market was closed on Election Day so the close on the day before was used. By 60 trading days after the election (approximately three months), DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ were higher on average from 6.4% to 9.2%.

&gt; Digging deeper into the data, the following table shows S&amp;P 500 performance 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-months after the election. 1- and 3-months after the election S&amp;P 500 was higher 77.8% and 88.9% of the time respectively. By 6-months and 1-year after, S&amp;P 500 was always higher, although gains did slow after 6-months. Years when the President’s party lost its majority in Congress are shaded in gray.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.stocktradersalmanac.com/UploadedImage/AIN_1222_20221103_Midterm_Election_Forward_Table.jpg))**

&gt; The Sweet Spot of the 4-year cycle is now. The headwinds that abound this time around are not entirely unlike past midterm years that have historically been mired by bear markets and uncertain economic and political times. Many of the current concerns do appear to be accounted for by the market’s declines coming into Q4. Inflation does remain stubbornly high despite the Fed aggressively raising rates this year. The Fed’s most recent statement may not have been as dovish as some had hoped for, but it did contain language that suggested the time to slow the pace of increases and possibly even pause hikes is closer now than it was six months ago. The market is likely to remain volatile as it awaits more clarity from the Fed and more signs that inflation is easing. Any back and fill periods by the market are likely an opportunity to consider adding to existing long positions or establishing new longs.

The experiences of Pinto, a Wall Street veteran who runs the [world's biggest investment bank](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/investor-relations/documents/quarterly-earnings/2022/3rd-quarter/c363d5ac-0a3e-483e-88ec-89767a8e266e.pdf) by revenue, informs his views at a key time for markets and the economy.

After unleashing trillions of dollars in support of households and businesses in 2020, the Federal Reserve is grappling with inflation at four-decade highs by raising rates and pulling back on its debt-buying programs. The moves have cratered stocks and bonds this year and rippled around the world as a surging dollar complicates other nations' own battles with inflation.

Living with pervasive inflation was ""very, very stressful"" and is especially hard on low-income families, Pinto said in a recent interview from JPMorgan's New York headquarters. Price increases averaged more than [300% a year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_Argentina#cite_note-ucematgu-80) in Argentina from 1975 to 1991.

## Aggressive Fed

While there is a growing chorus of voices who say that the Federal Reserve should slow or halt its rate increases amid some signs of price moderation, Pinto is not in that camp.

""That's why when people say, \`the Fed is too hawkish,' I disagree,"" said Pinto, who became JPMorgan's sole president and chief operating officer earlier this year, solidifying his status as CEO [Jamie Dimon](https://www.cnbc.com/jamie-dimon/)'s top lieutenant and potential successor.

""I think putting inflation back in a box is very important,"" he said. ""If it causes a slightly deeper recession for a period of time, that is the price we have to pay.""

The Fed can't allow inflation to become ingrained in the economy, according to the executive. A premature return to easier monetary policy risks repeating the mistakes of the 70s and 80s, he said.

That's why he thinks it's more likely the Fed errs on the side of being aggressive on rates. The Fed funds rate will probably peak at around 5%; that, along with a rise in unemployment, will likely curb inflation, Pinto said. The rate is currently in a 3% to 3.25% range.

## Markets haven't bottomed

Like a [string of other executives](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/19/amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-warns-its-time-to-batten-down-the-hatches.html) have said recently, including Dimon and [Goldman Sachs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GS/) CEO D[avid Solomon](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/18/goldman-ceo-david-solomon-says-theres-a-good-chance-of-a-recession-and-so-its-time-to-be-cautious.html), the U.S. faces a recession because of the Fed's predicament, Pinto said. The only question is how severe the slowdown will be. That, of course, is being reflected in the markets that Pinto watches daily.",273,60,tang4685,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yc9t0d/jpmorgan_president_says_a_recession_may_be_price/,yc9t0d
2022-10-21 06:20:57,r/stocks,An often-overlooked economic measure is signaling serious trouble ahead,"* **The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Indicators index indicated that conditions worsened in September.**
* **While not usually considered a major data point, the LEI, combined with Fed rate hikes, is signaling trouble for the economy.**
* **“We went from a Fed that was way too easy to being irresponsibly tight,” said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at SMBC Capital Markets.**

&amp;#x200B;

The economy sent a low-key signal Thursday that a recession is looming — and that the Federal Reserve could be making a policy mistake by continuing to try to slow things down.

According to the Conference Board’s [Leading Economic Indicators](https://www.conference-board.org/topics/us-leading-indicators) index, conditions worsened in September, with the gauge down 0.4% from the month before and off 2.8% for the six-month period.

“The US LEI fell again in September and its persistent downward trajectory in recent months suggests a recession is increasingly likely before year end,” said Ataman Ozyildirim, senior director of economics at the Conference Board. Ozyildrim noted that the weakness in the index was “widespread” as high inflation, a decelerating jobs picture and tighter credit conditions are pressuring the economy.

The index looks forward using 10 metrics that include manufacturing hours worked, jobless claims, building permits, stock market indexes and credit spreads.

Normally, the LEI is not considered a major data point. It’s not necessarily that the measure isn’t a good snapshot of the economy, but more that the data points that go into the index are already known, so there’s not much new information.

## A reverse trend for the Fed

However, in the present conditions, the index is of greater significance as it comes at a time when the Federal Reserve is looking to tighten the screws further on growth in an effort to bring down rampant inflation.

That bucks a general historical trend where the Fed is usually loosening policy when the outlook turns darker. However, Fed officials are stressing that they’re far from finished when it comes to raising rates.

“We went from a Fed that was way too easy to being irresponsibly tight,” said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at SMBC Capital Markets and a former senior economic advisor to then-President Donald Trump. “When this basket is signaling the weakness that it’s showing, what the Fed typically does is not raise rates. But in this case, it’s not only raising rates aggressively, but with a commitment to continue raising rates aggressively.”

LaVorgna’s research shows that in previous downturns in the leading indicators, the Fed was always cutting rates or in pause at the same time. This was the case in early 2020, the financial crisis in 2008 and the recession in the early part of the 21st century — among multiple other economic contractions.

He is concerned that the Fed’s insistence on tightening policy will have even worse outcomes ahead.

“The lags in the policy mean the full effects of Fed actions have not yet been wholly felt. Worryingly, the Fed is not done,” LaVorgna said in a client note.

LaVorgna is not alone in his belief that the Fed is overdoing its efforts to tamp down inflation that continues to run around its highest levels since the early 1980s.

In a [recent CNBC interview](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/04/barry-sternlicht-says-unbelievable-calamities-ahead-if-the-fed-keeps-hiking-.html?&amp;amp;qsearchterm=sternlicht%20fed), Starwood Capital Group CEO Barry Sternlicht said the central bank is risking “unbelievable calamities if they keep up their action, and not just here, all over the globe.” [Goldman Sachs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GS/) CEO David Solomon, [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JPM/) CEO [Jamie Dimon](https://www.cnbc.com/jamie-dimon/) and Amazon founder [Jeff Bezos](https://www.cnbc.com/jeff-bezos/) in recent days [all have expressed concern](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/19/amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-warns-its-time-to-batten-down-the-hatches.html) about a recession ahead, though they have not singled out the Fed’s actions.

## Disappointment on inflation

However, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said Thursday he thinks [the central bank still has work to do](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/20/feds-harker-sees-lack-of-progress-on-inflation-expects-aggressive-rate-hikes-ahead.html) before it can relax as he said he’s seen a “disappointing lack of progress” in the inflation fight.

“What we really need to see is a sustained decline in a number of inflation indicators before we let up on tightening monetary policy,” said the central bank official, who is a nonvoting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.

Thus far, the inflation data indeed has not been on the Fed’s side.

In addition to the typical headline metrics such as the consumer price index and the Fed’s preferred personal consumption expenditures price index, the Cleveland Fed’s [“sticky price” CPI](https://www.atlantafed.org/research/inflationproject/stickyprice) rose 8.5% on an annualized basis in September, up from 7.7% in August. The measure looks at items such as rent, the price of food away from home and recreation costs.

Services inflation has been particularly nagging, rising 7.4% in September on a 12-month basis, up from 6.8% in August, according to Trading Economics. That has happened as the economy has transitioned back to services from high goods demand for much of the Covid era.

Critics, though, say the Fed is following too many backward-looking data points. But policymakers also are fighting a battle against inflation expectations that, [while drifting lower now](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/11/consumer-inflation-and-spending-expectations-show-sharp-decline-.html), could turn higher especially now that gasoline prices are rising again.

“The challenge for the Fed is we haven’t seen the true leading indicators be leading in the sense that inflation has still stayed persistently elevated in the face of these leading indicators that would suggest otherwise,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial.

In Roach’s view, the only bright spot is that financial markets could be close to pricing in all of the damage from higher rates and inflation. Also, the continued decline in the LEI at least could give the Fed reason to slow the pace of its rate hikes. Roach expects the Fed to hike by another 0.75 percentage point in November, then decelerate to a 0.5-point move in December, which is not the market expectation.

“In a nutshell, this report does not likely change anything for the November meeting,” Roach said. “However, you could argue that this does build a case for a downshift in December.”

The entrepreneur has just broken his silence with a warning about the health of the economy, which will reinforce fears that a recession is inevitable. 

Because of its central place in e-commerce, Amazon is one of the reliable barometers of the health of public consumption, which in turn is a key engine of American economic growth.

""Yep, the probabilities in this economy tell you to batten down the hatches,"" Bezos posted on Twitter on Oct. 18.

In other words, he says people must prepare for a crisis that seems on the horizon. 

 

## Comment Regarding Goldman CEO Solomon

 The billionaire commented on a short video interview with David Solomon, the CEO of investment bank Goldman Sachs  (**GS**) - Get Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (The) Report, on CNBC, which was broadcast the same day. In the clip Solomon says that there is a big chance that the economy will enter a recession.

""I think it's a time to be cautious,"" Solomon said. ""And I think that if you're running a risk-based business, it's a time to think more cautiously about your risk box, your risk appetite. I think you have to expect that there's more volatility on the horizon.""

The banker added: ""Now, that doesn't mean for sure that we have a really difficult economic scenario, but in the distribution of outcomes, there's good chance we could have a recession.""

The economy's health is currently a subject of concern to markets, households and politicians alike, particularly as the U.S. midterm elections are just weeks away.

Many economists blame the Federal Reserve's monetary policy as one of the causes of the current downturn. The central bank was initially slow to raise its interest rates, thus allowing the prices of goods and products to rise, they say.

When the Fed subsequently pivoted by raising rates, it did so aggressively, in an attempt to crush inflation, which today is at a 40-year high. The problem, the same economists have warned, is that this effort will cause a so-called hard landing in the economy, a recession. 

In addition to Solomon, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase,  (**JPM**) - Get JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. Report said on Oct. 10 that the economy would enter a recession ""six to nine months from now.”

More than two-thirds (69%) of Americans are worried about the possibility of a recession by the end of 2023, according to a July survey by personal finance website Bankrate.com.",0,0,battle_rae,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y89r5z/jeff_bezos_makes_dire_prediction_about_the_economy/,y89r5z

#[Stock futures tick up on mixed earnings results from big banks](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/13/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Friday as investors turned their attention to big bank earnings after the major averages staged a historic turnaround rally.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 190 points, or 0.63%. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.69%, and Nasdaq 100 futures ticked up 0.66%.
*****
&gt; JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo gained after revenue topped expectations. Morgan Stanley reported a profit miss, sending shares down more than 2% in premarket trading. Citigroup also reported a miss in third-quarter profits.
*****
&gt; Dow member UnitedHealth also reported results that beat Wall Street expectations on Friday, sending shares higher.
*****
&gt; The outlook for this earnings season is not good. Profit for S&amp;P 500 companies increased a measly 2.4% in the third quarter, according to the latest analyst estimates collected by FactSet, the worst growth since third quarter 2020, the heart of the pandemic.
*****
&gt; When the third quarter began, earnings growth was expected to be 10% for the period, but rising costs and interest rates have eaten away at companies’ bottom lines. Leading up to the start of this reporting season, 65 S&amp;P companies have issued negative guidance, compared to just 41 giving positive outlooks, FactSet data shows.
*****
&gt; The reports come a day after the market staged a massive comeback. The Dow ended Thursday’s session up 827 points after being down more than 500 points at the intraday low. The S&amp;P 500 rose 2.6% to break a six-day losing streak, and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.2%.
*****
&gt; The moves followed the release of the consumer price index, a key U.S. inflation reading that came in hotter than expected for the month of September. Initially, this weighed on markets as investors braced themselves for the Federal Reserve to continue with its aggressive rate-hiking plan. Later, however, they shrugged off those worries.
*****
&gt; Still, persistent inflation remains a problem for the Fed and for investors’ worries around the central bank’s policy tightening.
*****
&gt; “With core CPI still moving in the wrong direction and the labor market strong, the conditions are not in place for a Fed policy pivot, which would be one of the conditions for a sustained rally in the equity market,” wrote UBS global wealth management chief investment officer Mark Haefele in a Friday note. “Moreover, as inflation remains elevated for longer and the Fed hikes further, the risk increases that the cumulative effect of policy tightening pushes the US economy into recession, undermining the outlook for corporate earnings.”
*****
&gt; There’s still more economic data this week, too. September’s retail sales will come out at 8:30 a.m. ET. Later in the morning, investors are looking forward to the latest consumer sentiment figures from the University of Michigan.

# [Stock futures fall to start week with key inflation data, earnings ahead](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/09/stock-futures-are-down-as-market-exits-rollercoaster-week.html)
*****
&gt; Stock futures were lower Monday morning as the markets come out of a tumultuous week and traders look ahead to key reports coming in the next week that can offer insights into the health of the economy.
*****
&gt; Futures connected to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 28 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were lower by 0.18%, while Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.30%.
*****
&gt; Market observers generally consider the week ahead as the kickoff to earnings season, with four of the world’s largest banks – JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Citi – reporting Friday. PepsiCo, Delta and Domino’s are also among companies reporting next week.
*****
&gt; Inflation will also take center stage as new monthly Consumer Price Index data comes Thursday morning.
*****
&gt; It will follow a week of whiplash for market participants. The first half of the week brought a relief rally that pushed the S&amp;P 500 up more than 5% in its largest two-day gain since 2020.
*****
&gt; But jobs data that economists say will keep the Federal Reserve on a path to continue raising interest rates and OPEC+’s decision to slash oil supply rattled investors, knocking the market down later in the week. When trading ended Friday, the S&amp;P was up 1.5% compared to where it started the week. The Dow and Nasdaq were up 1.5% and 0.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Still, the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq had the first positive week in the last four. All remain down substantially so far in 2022, however, and the Nasdaq is less than 1% away from its 52-week low.
*****
&gt; “The direction of the stock market is likely to be lower because either the economy and corporate profits are going to slow meaningfully or the Fed is going to have to raise rates even higher and keep them higher for longer,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, on Friday.
*****
&gt; “Given the conditions that we are operating under, we believe it’s prudent to begin preparing for a recession,” he added. “The talk of a shallow recession that is now the narrative-du-jour strikes us as eerily similar to the ‘inflation is transitory’ narrative of last year.”
*****
&gt; Last week brought heightened concerns that corporate earnings will show the ugly side of a surging dollar as Levi Strauss became the latest to cut guidance due to sliding international sales.

# **Dow drops 600 points, Nasdaq closes 3% lower as rates pop after September jobs report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/06/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks fell Friday as traders evaluated September’s jobs report, which showed the unemployment rate continuing to decline and sparked an increase in interest rates.
 *****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 630.15 points, or 2.1%, to 29,296.79. The S&amp;P 500 lost 2.8% to 3,639.66. The Nasdaq Composite slid 3.8% to 10,652.41, which is less than 1% above its low of the year.
*****
&gt; Friday’s losses trimmed the gains for what started out as a big comeback week for stocks. The major averages still ended the week higher but gave back most of the gains from the rally that kicked it off. The Dow rose 2% for the week, while the S&amp;P added 1.5%. The Nasdaq eked out a 0.7% gain.
*****
&gt; The U.S. economy added 263,000 jobs in September, slightly below a Dow Jones estimate of 275,000, the government said Friday. However, the unemployment rate came in at 3.5%, down from the 3.7% in the previous month in a sign that the jobs picture continues to strengthen even as the Federal Reserve tries to slow the economy with rate hikes to stem inflation.
*****
&gt; 10-year U.S. Treasury yield and the S&amp;P 500 this week
*****
&gt; “While the data was about as expected, the drop in the unemployment rate is seemingly what the markets are obsessed with because of what it means for the Fed,” said Bleakley Financial chief investment officer Peter Boockvar. “When combined with the low level of initial jobless claims, the pace of firing’s remains muted and this of course gets the Fed all fired up about continuing with its aggressive rate hikes.”
*****
&gt; The falling unemployment rate sparked a jump in rates, in turn weighing on stocks. The 2-year year Treasury yield rose 6 basis points to 4.316%. (1 basis point equals 0.01%.)
*****
&gt; Advanced Micro Devices’ stock tumbled after the chipmaker warned its third-quarter revenue would be lower than anticipated. Levi Strauss shares slipped following a cut to the company’s guidance.
*****
&gt; “The conclusion many we have spoken with have reached is that not only will the Fed not help markets, but in their dogged pursuit of price stability keep going until something breaks in the capital markets,” said Christopher Harvey, an equity analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. “What appears to be their increasingly singular focus — price stability — will likely help catalyze the dislocation.”

&gt; # 7 Things to Know About The Historically Strong Fourth Quarter

&gt; “You make most of your money in a bear market, you just don’t realize it at the time.” Shelby Cullom Davis

&gt; We all blinked, and it is now October, which could be good if you are hoping for higher stock prices. But, as this great quote by Shelby Cullom Davis explains, people’s decisions in a bear market will significantly impact their investments down the road.

&gt; Are you going to sell now that stocks are firmly in a bear market? Many investors have done that over the years and missed out on massive rallies as stocks eventually returned to new highs. This year hasn’t been fun at all for investors, but better times could be coming, and making a rash decision now could greatly impact your investments years from now.

&gt; To help with this, today we’ll take a closer look at the fourth quarter and show why a potential year-end rally (and maybe more) could be likely.

&gt; First, the fourth quarter is historically the best quarter of the year, with the S&amp;P 500 up 4.1% on average and nearly 80% of the time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image001-800x409.png))**

&gt; Second, this is a midterm year, and the good news is that market gains during these years are backloaded. In fact, October is the best month of a midterm year, followed by the second best month in November and the third best in December.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image002-800x338.png))**

&gt; Third, here’s a chart we’ve shared a lot lately, but we’ll do it again, as it is very powerful. Midterm years tend to see weak stock returns in the first three quarters (check for 2022), but the fourth quarter of a midterm is the second-best quarter out of the entire four-year Presidential cycle. The best quarter and third best quarter are right around the corner early next year. As bad as things have been this year, the calendar is currently a major tailwind.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image003-800x302.png))**

&gt; Fourth, the fourth quarter has historically done even better when September is down big. Given this year saw one of the worst Septembers ever for stocks, this could be another clue a bounce back is possible. To quote Lloyd Christmas, “So you’re telling me there’s a chance!”

&gt; Fifth, this was the third worst start to a year ever for the S&amp;P 500. Well, the good news is looking at the ten worst starts ever to a year saw the fourth quarter higher nine times. Only in 2008 was it red; fortunately, we don’t think we are in that environment. Going out a year, the S&amp;P 500 was up eight times and higher, a median of 25.5%.

&gt; Sixth, the S&amp;P 500 bear market cracked down 25% last week. As bad as that feels to investors, the stock market doesn’t care about what just happened and only cares about what is next. The good news is once a bear market is down 25%, the returns going out can be quite strong, with the S&amp;P 500 up nearly 23% on average a year later. Additionally, many lows took place soon after this milestone was hit, so a major low could be near. Yes, the ’73/’74 recession, tech bubble, and financial crisis all saw more weakness (and in some cases for a long time), but we don’t see an economy nearly as weak as those times. Therefore, we think this time will play out like the others, and stronger returns could be quite likely.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image016-800x501.png))**

&gt; Here’s another way of showing the study above. As you can see, many times once the S&amp;P 500 was down 25%, it was quite near a major low.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image010-800x383.png))**

&gt; Seventh and lastly, October is known as a bear market killer. Remember, this year was the worst start to a year since 1974 and 2002. Below we show how bear markets tend to bottom in October, and sure enough, both of those vicious bears ended in October. The ’73/’74 bear ended on October 3, while the tech bubble bear market bottomed on October 9.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image017-800x582.png))**

&gt; Investors are worried, and we understand those feelings here at the Carson Investment Research team. Could stocks bottom and rally? We think there’s an above-average chance. And a chance is all we need, as Lloyd Christmas would say.

&gt; # Bears Remain Above 50%

&gt; The past week's rebound in equity prices has bolstered sentiment a bit as the latest AAII survey showed an increase in bullishness. For the second week in a row, bullish sentiment rose week over week to come in at 23.9%. That is, of course, still below the reading of 26.1% only three weeks ago and even further depressed relative to the historical average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; The pickup in bullish sentiment borrowed from bears. After two consecutive weeks of readings above 60% (the first such occurrence in the history of the survey), bearish sentiment has turned lower falling to 54.8%. As with bullish sentiment, that marks some improvement, but much more progress would need to be made to bring bearish sentiment back in line with the historical average of 30.5%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; Although the streak of readings above 60% is over, more than half of the respondents remain bearish. As shown below, that has grown to be the longest streak of such readings since the depths of the COVID Crash. Prior to that, there have only been six other such streaks: four occurring between 2008 and 2009 and the others occurring in August and October of 1990.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-AAII-2a.png))**

&gt; With both bullish and bearish sentiment improving, the bull-bear spread has risen up to -30.9 after hitting the lowest level since 2009 only two weeks ago.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-AAII-3.png))**

&gt; Again, in spite of any improvement, sentiment remains heavily in favor of bears as it has for more than half a year. As shown below, the bull-bear spread has remained negative for 27 weeks in a row. That is the second-longest streak of negative readings on record but would need to continue for another two months to surpass the 2020 record.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-AAII-3a.png))**

&gt; Not all of the losses to bearish sentiment went to bulls. Neutral sentiment also rebounded slightly rising from sub-20% (the lowest level since April 2020) to 21.3%.

&gt; # Buy Yom Kippur Lines Up with Almanac Aggregate Cycle

&gt; The market may not be down during the Sell Rosh Hashanah/Buy Yom Kippur period which ends today on Yom Kippur 2022. But it sure was a wild ride. Most importantly it lines up perfectly with our Almanac Aggregate Cycle. Back in mid-August this Aggregate Cycle called the end of the summer rally and now it’s pointing to a big move higher.

&gt; You can check the full stats Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur, Sell Passover in our September 23 post, but here’s a reminder of the awesome history of rallies from midterm year Yom Kippur to pre-election Passover. DJIA p 10 of 12, average gain 12.0%.

&gt; # Big Bounce in Claims...Or Is It?

&gt; Following a few months of downward trending initial jobless claims bringing the indicator back down around multi-decade lows, there has finally been a significant uptick. Whereas last week's reading was revised lower to an even more impressive 190K (the lowest since April), the latest print soared 29K to 219K. That is only the highest level since the end of August, but it also is back in the range of pre-pandemic readings while also marking the largest week over week increase in claims since the first week of June.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims rose as might have been expected for the current week of the year. As shown in the second chart below, as far as consistency of week-over-week increases go, the current week of the year is tied with the 2nd and 45th (approximately the weeks of January 8th and November 5th) for fourth as claims have risen 85.5% of the time since 1967. Additionally, before seasonal adjustment, it was not a particularly large increase as the 13.3K WoW rise was half of the average for the comparable week of the year. Even after that increase, unadjusted claims have only been lower during the year's comparable week twice: 1968 and 1969. In other words, a drift higher in claims is normal at this point of the year, and even with that move higher, claims remain nothing short of impressive.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; As for continuing claims which are lagged an additional week to the initial claims number, the latest week saw a modest increase of 15K to 1.361 million. That snapped a streak of four consecutive weeks of declines. Whereas seasonally adjusted initial claims have risen back into the pre-pandemic range, continuing claims have only experienced a modest move higher and are well below their own levels from pre-pandemic years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/100622-Claims-3.png))**

&gt; In the past few months, we have consistently checked in on the ratio of initial jobless claims to continuing claims (both seasonally adjusted) as a measure of the lack of follow-through of the former to the latter. With last week's very strong initial claims number that was more reflective of the still strong continuing claims number, that ratio has now come back in line with the historical average.

&gt; # Market Rebounds 28.2% After Midterm Year Down YTD Q3

&gt; S&amp;P 500 closed September down -24.8% year-to-date – the 4th worst YTD Q3 performance since 1930. Since WWII (1946) when S&amp;P 500 was down YTD at the end of Q3 in midterm year it gained 28.2% on average over the next 5 quarters with no losses.

&gt; In all 23 years the following Q4 was up 69.6 % of the time for an average gain of 3.1%. Subsequent Q1s were up only 52.2% of the time for an average gain of 2.7%. The following Q2s gained ground 65.2% of the time for an average gain of 2.9% and then next years were up 73.9% of the time for an average gain of 11.9%.

&gt; But the record for midterm years down at the end of Q3 is better. Of those nine midterm years highlighted in blue in the table only 1946 into 1947 had no bounce with 1947 closing exactly at the same price as 1946 for S&amp;P. Overall, Q4s were up 88.9% of the time, average gain 7.6%, Q1s up 77.8% of the time, average gain 6.7%, Q2 up 77.8% of the time, average gain 4.6% and next years up 88.9% of the time, average gain 19.2%.

&gt; So, while things look grim out there on Wall Street, economically and globally, odds are we are nearing a bottom and the prospects for Q4 and next year are encouraging, at least historically, seasonally and 4-year cycle-wise. But there is still a lot that needs to go right, and the market likely has further downside left.

I have only $80/month left for these stocks in my portfolio:

A) Is it better to buy two dividend securities for $40 every month or

B) Does it make more sense to buy 4 securities for $20 or even 8 ones for $10 per month?

2022-08-19 21:28:29,r/stocks,"Setting and Forgetting SPY, NDAQ, Bank Stocks","I've been looking at YOY returns over the past 5 years for stocks, the SNP500 (how different is it to the SPY ETF?) is up 72% over the past 5 years, NDAQ is up 147% with an additional dividend of 0.43% annually, while bank stocks (TD, RY, JPM) have more modest growth of only about 20-30%, but have dividends around 3-4% annually, with the largest return I've found being TD at a growth of 34% and dividends of 4.09% annually. 

My parents are big fans of bank stocks precisely because of their large dividends, but doing the math at best you'd get say a 34x(1.04\^5) = 40 percent return on investment over five years. 

This just seems strictly worse than keeping everything in one of the two other stocks I mentioned. Now, granted, bank stocks seem more stable and they have comparable growth over all time (is this a worthwhile metric?) but if I decide to invest over the long term (10+ years), I don't see bank stocks even with high dividends beating the large strict value increase of the SPY or NDAQ. 

Is there something I'm missing? Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated.

2022-07-28 05:06:31,r/stocks,Sectors that benefit from rising interest rates," Banks

Rising rates tend to point to a strong economy. And that health usually means that borrowers have an easier time making loan payments and banks have fewer [non-performing assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/non-performing-assets.asp). It also means that banks can earn more from the spread between what they pay (to savers for [savings accounts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/savingsaccount.asp) and [certificates of deposit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp)) and what they can earn (from highly-rated debt like Treasuries).

Banks that might benefit as rates rise include Bank of America Corp. ([BAC](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=bac)), which has a substantial presence throughout the U.S.; JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. ([JPM](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=jpm)), with its robust operations in the U.S. and worldwide; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ([GS](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=gs)), with widespread [investment banking](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-banking.asp) and [wealth management](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wealthmanagement.asp) services, and Citigroup Inc. ([C](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=c)), which does business in more than 160 countries.2 

### Brokers

On the [broker](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker.asp) front, companies like E\*TRADE Financial Corp., Charles Schwab Corp. ([SCHW](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=schw)), and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp., all hold promise during times of escalating rates for similar reasons. A healthy economy sees more investment activity and brokerage firms also benefit from increased [interest income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/net-interest-income.asp) when rates move higher.

### Insurers

Insurance stocks can flourish as rates rise. In fact, the relationship between interest rates and insurance companies is linear, meaning the higher the rate, the greater the growth. These same insurance providers, such as The Allstate Corp. ([ALL](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=all)), AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. ([AFSIN](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=afsin)), and The Travelers Companies, Inc. ([TRV](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=trv)), don’t fare as well in low-rate climates because their underlying bond investments yield weak returns.

Insurers, which have steady cash flows, are compelled to hold lots of safe debt to back the insurance policies they write. In addition, the economic health dividend also applies to insurers. Improving [consumer sentiment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-sentiment.asp) means more car purchasing and improving home sales, which means more policy-writing.

## Beyond Financials

Financials aren’t the only star performers in a rising rate environment. [Consumer discretionary](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-discretionary.asp) stocks also can see a bump because improving employment, coupled with a healthier housing market, makes consumers more likely to splurge on purchases outside of the realm of [consumer staples](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerstaples.asp) (food, beverages, and hygiene goods).

Manufacturers and [sellers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seller.asp) of kitchen appliances, cars, clothes, hotels, restaurants, and movies also benefit from the economic health dividend. Companies to keep an eye on during interest rate increases include appliance maker Whirlpool Corp. and retailers Kohl's Corp., Costco Wholesale Corp., and Home Depot, Inc. 

Finally, the industrials sector also benefits from the economic health dividend indicated by rising rates. Companies like Ingersoll-Rand PLC and manufacturers of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, tend to [outperform](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outperform.asp), as well as companies like PACCAR, a maker of heavy-duty trucks and truck parts. Such companies are among the first to benefit from any increase in [housing starts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/housingstarts.asp).",0,0,PizzaGuy94122,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/w9yafo/sectors_that_benefit_from_rising_interest_rates/,w9yafo
2022-07-18 19:50:40,r/stocks,API for Earnings season (earning estimates &amp; quarterly earnings),"Hello there,

Do you guys know of an API (can be paid) which provides

1. Earnings estimates i.e. forecasted EPS consensus, # of estimates etc.,
2. Up to date quarterly earnings data submitted by the company

Surprisingly, I checked Alpha Vantage API for this but JPM earnings that were submitted last week aren't there (using free key). I checked free yfinance API and JPM quarterly earnings are there but only revenue and earnings. I'm checking now some paid options like EODHD but they seem to lack #1. Ugh. Quite new to coding. Using Python.

Thanks in advance

EDIT:

1. **EODHD** has this data and quite a bit more though it costs for me 49.99 EUR per month for fundamental data ONLY. One can check the sample for AAPL [https://eodhistoricaldata.com/api/fundamentals/AAPL.US?api\_token=demo](https://eodhistoricaldata.com/api/fundamentals/AAPL.US?api_token=demo)

# [Dow futures fall more than 400 points as traders weigh potential for big rate hikes](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/13/stock-futures-slip-after-wednesdays-session-as-wall-street-awaits-bank-earnings.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures fell Thursday as traders assess the possibility of even tighter U.S. monetary policy on the back of a hot inflation report. Traders also pored over key quarterly results.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures shed 481 points, or 1.56%. S&amp;P 500 futures were 1.49% lower, and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 1.13%.
*****
&gt; Futures added to their losses after JPMorgan Chase reported quarterly earnings that missed analyst expectations. The stock fell more than 4% in premarket trading. Morgan Stanley is also set to report Thursday.
*****
&gt; The consumer price index rose 9.1% on the year in June, higher than a Dow Jones estimate for an 8.8% year-over-year increase. Core CPI, which excludes volatile prices of food and energy, was 5.9%, also ahead of a 5.7% estimate.
*****
&gt; In addition, the Beige Book, released Wednesday by the Fed showed worries of an upcoming recession amid high inflation.
*****
&gt; The CPI report also impacted treasuries, sending the 2-year Treasury yield up nine basis points to about 3.138% while the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell about 4 basis points to 2.919. An inversion of the two is a popular signal of a recession.
*****
&gt; The report also opened the door for a big Federal Reserve rate increase later this month, with the fed funds futures market now pricing in a hike of as much as 1% — or 100 basis points.
*****
&gt; “The takeaway for investors is that Fed policy remains data-dependent and the central bank will continue on an aggressive tightening path until inflationary pressures peak decisively,” strategists at BCA Research wrote in a note. “Persistent price pressures call for another jumbo hike at the July 26-27 FOMC, but there is still room for the data to improve before the September meeting, 8 weeks later.”
*****
&gt; Weekly jobless claims and the June producer price index report, which measures prices paid to producers of goods and services, will also be released Thursday. Both reports will give further insight into the economy.

I’ve always been of the mindset to buy great companies/funds that I like and hold. Due to that I’ve realized some gains in a handful of winners (axp,jpm,msft,appl,vfv). All though my gains are no where near what they were at ATH; they’ve still yielded and adequate return. In addition, I hold a few etfs that are down but realizing those gains for cash wouldn’t result in a terrible loss. 

I want to buy a house in the near future (1-2years) and would like to load up on this decline at some point. I’m stuck deciding whether I should sell and take the cash off the table or just continue holding despite not being confident in the market for the next 2-3 years. 

I don’t need the money in the near future necessarily as I have a good secure job and still have a sizeable cash position.  I would have about 40% of my portfolio still invested companies/funds like Amazon, FB, dis + ETFs and a chunk of crypto (btc/eth).

Want to complete 100 share positions in each of these growth companies while they're beaten up (fully understand some of these companies aren't profitable yet, but have high hopes and looking to capitalize on the next bull run). I haven't averaged up on any of these stocks so far, just picking them up on every dip.

After I complete these positions, I'm going to fill up on the small cap growth names that have been getting killed:

RDFN
FUBO
UWMC
RKT
SOFI
QS
RIVN

This should take me a month or so to grab all of these for 100 shares. After getting all the growth I want as we work into the bottom, I'm going to be spreading out the 4k a month into stocks like META, APPL, COST, TGT, JPM, COF, AMZ, and other big name companies. 

My approach is interesting, but I've been watching the market since 2017. Listening to podcasts, reading books, staying involved. Plan to hold for years. The approach seems backwards, should be buying blue chips at the lows, safe haven stocks, dividends, but I'm just looking to take full advantage of this downturn.

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose early on Tuesday following a losing day as the market attempted to keep its rebound from the bear-market lows going.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 208 points or 0.7%. S&amp;P 500 futures edged up 0.6% and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.5%.
*****
&gt; The overnight action followed modest losses on Wall Street as a comeback rally stalled. The blue-chip Dow fell about 60 points, while the broader benchmark, the S&amp;P 500, dipped 0.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 0.7% on Monday. The major averages rallied last week, posting their first positive week since May as major averages rallied off their lows for the year. The S&amp;P 500 is still down 18% on the year but is up more than 7% from its low hit in mid-June.
*****
&gt; “One of the trickier calls in this business is evaluating the difference between a bounce in a bear market vs. the start of a more durable advance,” wrote Chris Verrone, technical analyst with Strategas. “The current bounce, +8% over the last 4 trading days, has been impressive on the surface as most moves of this context tend to be, but again has yet to signal any resounding internal or leadership improvement.”

&gt; On Tuesday China relaxed its Covid restrictions for inbound travelers, cutting their quarantine time upon arrival by half to seven days. That gave travel and casino stocks a lift in premarket trading. Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands rose more than 6% each. American, United and Delta Air Lines all added more than 1%.
*****
&gt; Several major banks raised their dividends in response to successfully clearing this year’s Federal Reserve stress tests, including Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. JPMorgan and Citigroup, however, said increasingly stringent capital requirements forced them to keep their dividends unchanged.

&gt; Morgan Stanley shares gained nearly 4% in premarket trading.

&gt; Investors will monitor more data on Tuesday including June consumer confidence and April home prices to gauge the health of the economy. Fears of a recession have increased lately as the Federal Reserve tries to combat surging inflation with aggressive rate hikes.

&gt; “Market bulls who have had the rug repeatedly pulled out from under them this year may understandably be suspect of the rally, since many of 2022′s upswings have quickly given way to fresh lows and this time may be no different,” said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading at E-Trade.

&gt; Shares of Nike edged lower in pre-market trading even after the sportswear company topped Wall Street’s earnings and sales expectations for the fiscal fourth-quarter despite a Covid lockdown in China and a tougher climate for consumers in the U.S.
*****
&gt; Despite last week’s bounce, the S&amp;P 500 is down nearly 14% in the second quarter, on track to post its worst quarter since the first quarter of 2020, at the depth of the pandemic.
*****
&gt; “The bounce from the bear market lows is a welcome change, though slowing economic growth and lack of capitulation among investors has many skeptical of the durability of the recovery,” said Mark Hackett, Nationwide’s chief of investment research.

What comes to my mind are the likes of $KO, $BLK, $BRK.B, $JPM, and $T.

Consistently delivering dividends would be a great +. 

Right now I have been focusing on Norwegian stocks, and so far I am around +350% up this year since I hit the jackpot with Solstad Offshore (ticker SOFF on the OBX exchange) and the energy stocks here have been booming.

But now feel like exploring the US market. As of today, I only have Apple (AAPL) and Lithium Americas ($LAC), not more than 1500$ invested in total - just to get a taste. 

Any suggestions or discussion would be greatly appreciated!

It’s a reminder that there are always competing perspectives and the current sentiment  does not necessarily reflect the future. Things can change quickly. I don’t mean this to encourage blind optimism, but it’s worth noting that we should not all resign ourselves to market collapse either

So what other commonly-agreed high conviction bring-it-to-grave stocks that can be used as the low tide markers? I will list the FAANG first and will add more if you can let me know stocks in other sectors, like TGT and WMT? JPM?

EDIT: To clarify my question, I'm asking about high-conviction stocks now, in this period, your period. Let's say if you own AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, MCD, KO and SPY, which will be the last stock to sell if you have experienced financial hardship (I don't wish this to anyone!)?

UPDATE: I'll keep adding mentioned tickers. There are few stocks still holding strong (less than 15% discount), such as WM, KO, ABBV and MCD. Perhaps when these 10%er move into 20%er, the final heirlooms are pawned.

2022-05-19 16:55:40,r/stocks,"Please explain to me why people say we are at a sort of dotcom bubble, when P/E is the cheapest it has ever been?","I went to compare the P/E of some mega companies that exist for a long time like INTEL/JPM/Netflix/FB and you can more or less do it with any big name.

And I didn't find a single point in time where the stock was cheaper than it is today, by cheap I mean P/E ratio.

So for me it is weird that people say stocks are overvalued and need a correction and its just the start and they need to get down more 50%.

I mean if INTEL goes down 50% more just the dividend alone would be around 6% which is insane for tech company (or almost any company) and the P/E would be like 4 P/E which is just funny.

There are some way way way way way overpriced companies like TSLA that can drop 90% and still be overpriced I agree with that, but the broader market is actually cheap, like really really cheap.

2022-05-18 22:41:23,r/stocks,Bargain Price PE Ratios,"It appears that certain stocks in the market are trading at bargain prices.

We all know that the market has been inflated. Certain stocks that have been severely inflated have come back to normal (examples AFRM, DKNG); other mega and large cap stocks are still trading at PEs trading over 30 (AMZN, TWTR, TSLA).

However, with liquidity leaving the market, it appears that some bargains are available. Certain large-cap stocks are being offered at low PE ratios and most pay what is now a 3% or higher dividend. Specific Examples and their PEs include the following:

INTC - 7
WFC, JPM, C - 8-9
F - 4
TM - 9
T - 8
FNF - 5

It appears that even though the market as a whole has taken a hit, and other companies may still need A return to reasonable price levels, there is value in the market to be found in the middle of the decline. 

It seems that large institutions seeing these values and may begin to reinvest in such companies shortly at bargain PE prices. 

Obviously there is more to an analysis of a company then just the PE, but it can be a useful indicator.

2022-05-11 01:01:20,r/stocks,"SOFI down bad after earnings, but is the 80% crash a huge overreaction?","SOFI fell 12% today after a leaked earnings report which showed slightly better-than-expected top and bottom lines, but slightly worse-than-expected guidance. It's now down 79% from its ATH and is trading at a 1.35 price/book ratio - meaning that for every share you own, you almost own the equivalent value in assets as opposed to only betting on projected future cash flows. That's not unusual for a big bank's stock, as loan assets only generate a few cents on the dollar. For reference, JPM is currently trading at 1.41 P/B, and TD bank is trading at 1.73. There's a huge disconnect here, as SOFI is a young, high-growth company which could justify much higher multiples. 

Many of the concerns related to student loans are, IMO, just ""seeing ghosts"" - Biden's plan for student loan forgiveness would not take away any existing loans from SOFI, as they have been refinanced as private loans, and the gov can only forgive federal loans. While this *could* decrease TAM for SOFI, it also allows more breathing room for people with &gt;10k in student debt, reducing their risk of default and making them more attractive customers for SOFI. Furthermore, while the student loan moratorium has stunted SOFI's growth in taking on new loans, this will not last forever, and we can expect SOFI's already high revenue growth rate to explode. 

I'm quite bullish on SOFI during this crash, so I'm wondering about your opinions on the bear case, or just your thoughts in general. It's been quite quiet regarding this stock lately.",32,12,Brushermans,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/umvb0j/sofi_down_bad_after_earnings_but_is_the_80_crash/,umvb0j

2022-05-08 17:17:24,r/stocks,Repost: Bear facts,"This was posted by a user who seems to have been deleted, so I am reposting for archival posterity purposes.

\-------------

I haven't posted in a while due to personal circumstances but I've been reading along regularly in the daily posts and sharing in all your tales of joy and suffering.

I want to put forward a random epic rant about some stuff that's in my mind currently. This isn't really structured, just, what comes to mind as I think about the market today, thoughts circulating around the last month or two. Maybe someone will find it interesting.

# Time &amp; Experience

Keep in mind, I'm a much older investor than most of you, that doesn't make me a better investor (in fact, the last 18 months, and the period from 2015-2020 have been a shit time to be a bear!), but it means I've lived through stuff that is just old tales in the history books for you.

Part of that is about understanding the experience of loss, part of it is expanding your idea of what's possible. I mean, if I built a time machine, went back and told you in November, ""Netflix will fall from $700 to $250 within months, and yet, no one will be rushing to buy it, in fact it will then keep dropping some more the next day"", you would have laughed at me a lot and pointed out how Squid Game was currently the most popular show in the world and netflix was an amazing growth stock with limitless potential. That was just six months ago, when people lived in that version of reality. Inflation was high then, but it was 'transitional', rates were 0%, there was no need for rate rises, the housing market was continuing up at blistering pace. Mortgage rates in the USA were 2.5% for a 30 year loan. Europe was at peace. Picking up the paper, no one was discussing where a nuke might land. Delta was a pain in the butt but we seemed to be getting finally through the worst of covid, at the start of november, omicron was barely on the radar, omicron B2, XE, 98, ME, 2000, or Omicron 11 Professional Edition didn't even exist. That was just six months ago!

If that much can change in the last six months, imagine what it will look like six months in the future, just try to imagine! It's like the blind spot in your field of vision. Your instincts will say 'pretty much the same as today, perhaps a linear extension of the trends we see today'. But actually we could be really very far from that. There could be a major earthquake somewhere, war could get a LOT worse, new disease can show up, rates might have to rise above inflation to control it, inflation could *keep* rising rapidly, there could be a currency crisis, a crypto wipeout, a new technology might be discovered (like MRNA vaccines) that suddenly and rapidly changes the game for humanity. The 'mood' of the world might change, grow more gloomy, the markets may crash through the floor to a degree that seems as impossible to you today, just as impossible as Netflix $220, or tens of thousands of US military volunteers travelling to fight for the future of Ukrainian democracy against the real threat of Russian nukes would have seemed to you in November 2021. Nonetheless, things happen, totally regardless of what we each believe is the range of possible futures. Our personal models of the future fail again and again, yet we each retain absolute confidence in them somehow and always think 'the next 6 months will be mostly just like today, except maybe some musician will get married or die or something'. If you want to make God laugh, tell him about your plans, or about your views on the future.

# A lot of people don't even know themselves yet

You can train soldiers for years but they won't know till they're in combat what combat actually feels like, or how they'll react to it. Similarly, you could read this forum all day, read buffett's letters, read AMD's earnings report, read books, watch youtubes or tiktoks or whatever, trade all you like in a happy, upwards, safe market. But there's literally nothing that will prepare you for the cold hard ninja-nut-punch when you realise 80% of your money is just... gone. It isn't coming back. It's too late. You've fucked it up. You *can't* unfuck it. A decade or two of grind in a shit job you hate is the only way back. I speak from experience. I've been there. It permanently changed how I invest and made me a hyper-cautious scaredy-bear for life. Making money in a euphoric bubble vs losing money in a brutal crash, is like the difference between having fun in the bedroom with someone, vs having a baby burst out so forcefully and painfully that the entire lower body instantly rips open all the way round from front to back. Experience gained from one is not a teacher for the other.

Like the moment your doctor tells you that you have cancer. I've been there. Like the moment a one-night-stand texts you she's pregnant and not getting an abortion, (thankfully avoided this one). You can't know who you are, till you're actually standing there experiencing it. Living in a new type of experience. No amount of bookwork or pre-thought or imagination will show you who'll you be in that moment. That feeling of 'hmmm... shit.' you feel looking at the market dumping today or netflix losing 36% and then losing so more %s after that.... this is not the end, it is only barely the *beginning* of the experience you're going to have one day, and probably very soon. It is the pre-appetiser nibble, not even the appetiser, certainly not the main course. I'm afraid to say, new investors, that you are only seeing the oh-shit seagull balanced on the tip of the oh-shit iceberg through your telescope. By 'new investors' I mean anyone who joined the market in the last 22 years.

# 22 years??? wtf?

Yes. 22 years. That's when the last proper secular bear market began. 2018 and 2020 were corrections. Technically, 2020 qualified as a bear by depth of crash, but it was not a real bear market. 2008 was a proper decent bear market, but not the start of a secular bear, just a piece of an existing one. A secular bear is when you put your money in and don't see those levels again for over a decade. A secular bear is a total nightmare for anyone who's not a value investor (because value investors don't really care much about the market's opinion anyway). 2000 qualifies, because it took til 2015 for most QQQ / SP500 investors to get back what they put in. Corrections and crashes are about sudden, painful losses, but you can easily just take a nap and wait them out unless you trade options (very common now, not common in the past). We used to see 10% corrections almost every year, sometimes several, but all the easy money and mania and euphoria has made all dips shallow in the last 6 years excluding Dec 2018 and Mar 2020.

Bear markets are about brutal losses, they drive margin-users out of the market and give everyone else a big fright / buying opportunity for a year or two.

But secular bears? Holy fuck. Secular bears are just a different game. Secular bears, you wait a month, you wait a year, you wait 3 years, you wait 5 years. Jesus christ I'm still down 50%!. You wait 10 years, oh my god I'm still down. You wait 15-20 years, oh jesus, finally! finally! I can sell and get my money back! Secular bears are when you write a letter to yourself reminding future you of why Chewy, Rivian or GME truly is an amazing company and definitely not to sell it, then 8 years later, you find the letter in a box in the attic (having long since lost interest in investing), you read it, laugh a little, cry a lot, and then you either burn the letter or frame it.

If your child is born the very first day of the start of a secular bear market, your first grandchild may be getting born by the time you get your money back out from the market. Look at the 1930-&gt;1950s secular bear for example. Secular bears make society stop talking about stock investing completely, it becomes taboo at first, then just, not interesting. No one cares. We are very far away from that stage of the market!

But from a CAPE 40 (January), that's what you'd expect to see in the next 10 years, from all the historical data, you should expect a secular bear to be beginning. Rates rising, QT, inflation, supply/demand crisis, labour costs rising, epic bubbles in housing, bonds, crypto, stocks, growth going ex-growth, hype losing it's hype - sorry folks, but we are going straight towards a secular bear whether you want it or not. It's just how it is. Ask yourself, how many people do you know that are actually prepared emotionally and financially for multiple years of grinding losses, like 2000 or 2008? For decades of stagnation? Like 2000-2015 and 1930-1950s?

Look up the DJIA from 1934-1950. Look it up from 1966 to 1982. Look it up from 2000 to 2016. This 'secular bear' thing is not an imaginary concept. It comes around every few decades, and it ruins the lives of all the investors who hate history books.

Your great-grandparents lived through several secular bears, your grandparents too, your parents too. It's just part of the human experience. Now, it is probably going to be your turn to experience your first secular bear. Whatever happens next, it will not be like the fun and games of the last 24 months, I assure you.

# The euphoria is clearly starting to fade.

We're now several months since a new all-time high in the indices was last reached. The emotions that replace euphoria aren't 'hope' or 'resoluteness', they're 'boredom', 'frustration', 'despair'. The emotions that follow after those ones are 'caution', 'panic', 'fear'.

Long-term market price comes from company value, but short-term it comes from waves of people changing from buyers to holders, holders to sellers or vice versa. An imbalance between people wanting to buy or sell is the force that creates bubbles and crashes. And we're seeing a change of balance taking place currently, though it comes in waves, as people flip-flop back to greed one week, fear the next. But long-term, the euphoria is clearly draining away. The thing about euphoria is that when you lose it, it doesn't quickly come back. The thing about fear is, when you get it, it doesn't quickly go away.

We'll eventually pass through 'selling from caution', 'selling from boredom', 'selling from fear', and will then reach 'forced selling'. Where people just have to close positions because they were running on margin, or they put more into the stockmarket than was wise and have to meet some household expenses, or whatever. You'll recognise it because *everything* goes down. Even safe-haven stocks losing 5%. People get to the point they simply can't manage the emotional pain caused by seeing losses after losses. Unfortunately (for bulls), the more that bulls convert to bears (or are forcibly converted by their broker or wife/husband), the less fun it is to be a bull going forward for years to come. As a classical-value investor, I hate to say it, but short &amp; long-term momentum is a real effect, and it's driven by human psychology.

# The fall is still beginning

With hype stocks, memes, spacs etc, we may see a 2000 style market overvaluation. I have a 'pick the right meme stock!' book on my bookshelf from 2000, telling you the hot stocks to buy. It's quite amusing. We didn't call them meme stocks then, just 'internet stocks' or 'dotcoms'. And we didn't have Buttcorn, we had Flooz. But you get the idea.

With an overpriced housing market, we see 2008 style market overvaluation, 'flipping' etc.

With bonds priced all the way down to &lt;1% rates on the 30y not long ago, we saw a new type of market overvaluation, which is now rapidly correcting.

All of which coincided with short rates &amp; QE being the driving factors. Now both of these are in reverse. Let's suppose we get only one of those bubbles turning to a crash, and not all three running together.

2000-2002: We saw the nasdaq decline 78%. Currently, it's only declined 18%.

**In other words, as of today, April 21st, we're just 1/8th of the way to replaying the last tech hype bubble drop.**

18% drop from peak -&gt; 82% left

18% drop from there -&gt; .82 x .82 = 67% left

18% drop again -&gt; 55% left

18% drop again -&gt; 45% left

18% drop again -&gt; 37% left

18% drop again -&gt; 30% left

18% drop again -&gt; 25% left

18% drop again -&gt; 20% left

So, we would need to see another 7 similar dumps of 18% in the nasdaq like the one from November 2021 peak to today, in addition to the drops already happened, to replay the 2000-2002 tech/hype/meme crash. Stop and think about that for a moment if you're investing in these stocks. The 'bummer' feeling you have today is 1/8 of what you may have by the end. You will go through this again, and again, and still not even be halfway through the suffering.

# Nah it won't happen

Now you will all have lots of reasons why 'that can't happen again, this time is different' etc. Copium is a real psychological effect, read up on 'the five stages of grief bargaining' etc. But load up the share price charts for your favourite memes and scroll back to 2015-2016.

Let's take netflix as an example. Netflix in 2012 was $7. In 2015, $47. 2016? $85. And that was *without* a market crash backdrop, and without competition, without 'the end of customer growth'. That was a company with a basic perfect future ahead, lots of customers to be discovered, that was how it was priced in a market not facing QT and rate rises, tax rises, rising labour costs, etc. None of which is true any more.

The idea of netflix dropping another, say, 33% from here shouldn't seem unreasonable. $150 netflix would put it on a PER equal to the long-term US average for ex-growth, non-monopoly companies around PER 15. Also sort of matches the 2000 dotcom price drop. Besides, a further 33% drop in netflix shouldn't seem THAT weird when we literally had a 36% drop happen out of nowhere literally 2 days ago.

Or how about AMD? The last few years it enjoyed a lack of performance competition from intel. Now, it's competing with Apple, with Amazon/Google data warehouse custom chips, it's competing with nvidia in graphics (who are winning), and intel is winning on both price and performance again in the x86 consumer market. The only place AMD are still hanging on is x86 server performance, and not for long. 3D chips have not been the outrageous victory hoped for this year either.

AMD is in a technologically inferior and substantially financially weaker position than Intel. We should expect their share PERs to be much closer together. Intel's PER is about 10-13 (depending on where earnings come in soon). Even viewing AMD as 'going ex hyper-growth, exiting the glory years, room to still grow share' you'd maybe put it on a 15-18 PER.

Let's take the highest analyst forward earnings estimate for 2022 and price that with a 15 PER, higher than intels. ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amd/earnings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amd/earnings)). That's 3.78 earnings x 15 per = 56.7$. That's not even crash pricing. That's pricing for 'return to normality'. If we do the 'nasdaq dumped 78% in the last tech crash' assumption and apply to AMD's peak price, we get $164 peak, x 0.22 = $36. Even in the last 12 months, AMD was priced at $72.50. In 2020, &lt;$40.

So whichever point of view you take, there's a lot of air still underneath these prices potentially.

And yet AMD and Netflix are about as good as it gets for overall company quality, duopoly, and potential growth among the tech hype meme bubble darlings. If AMD and netflix holders may have heavy bags for years to come, what happens to all the purely-meme crap holders?

Can it happen? Sure it can. Look at the Intel, Microsoft share prices between 2000 to 2015, Cisco etc. These were the technology hype darlings of the time. It really happens. It can take literally 20+ years to get your money back out again.

# Mortgage rates.

US mortgage rates were around 2.5% for 30 years merely 4 months ago.

Recently they've been over 6%. If you assume most people 'buy as much house as they can afford for a monthly payment', then that equates to every $500k house becoming a $400k house, even absent a recession or any other factors like change of housebuyer sentiment in the market. It seems to me a lot of people haven't figured this out. [r/rebubble](https://www.reddit.com/r/rebubble/) has more.

Likewise, in Australia and Canada, did you know that most mortgages are adjustible rate (around 90% in both cases, though less among the most recent mortgages). In the past, short-rates had to rise above inflation to control inflation, eg over 10% rates. Can you imagine what these two countries will look like with 10% rates? Personally, I surely would not be investing in Australian or Canadian banks right now.

Of course, banks make more money long-term when rates are high, usually, but they tend to suffer crippling short-term losses during the period of 'rates becoming high' beforehand. It's like the difference between simply having a muscular physique and the pain you have to go through to get there at first. Hence, we see banks making significantly increased loss provisions currently. I expect to see bank stocks get slammed pretty hard this year, even more than we've seen already. JPM &amp; BAC are about as good as it gets globally for banking, but my price target on JPM for example is around $90, which is more in line with historical lows for the stock given growth over the years. For BAC I'd struggle to persuade myself to pay above $20-25. The thing is, I remember just how bad it got in the 2008 crash for banks. Last time around I saw Citigroup drop 99% from peak at one point, in 2008. Which wasn't the worst of it. I watched half the banking sector completely go out of business in months here. I saw major international banks dropping 40% off their share price in minutes on no news, in 2008, and that wasn't during the start of the crash when prices were sky high, that was late on, prices already low as we got deeper into credit markets locking up.

# General bad backdrop, potential risks

Russia/Ukraine, Covid, are not going to make inflation and supply/demand problems go away. They're not going to lower taxes or energy/food costs. Russia is set to formally default on its debt around 4th May, 30 days after the payments were due (Star wars day! May the fourth be with you!). If Putin decides to test the 'escalate to de-escalate' (aka total insanity) theory, and starts throwing nukes around to show off, the market is not going to rally up on that.

We saw several major new strains of covid in the last two years. Alpha was 'tougher', Delta was 'tougher', and Omicron unlocked the 'spread to the planet in 2 months' feature. Consider original SARS in 2000 and the death rate it had, that's how bad this could get with a coronavirus -we know, because it already did!

If we get a strain of omicron with the lethality of SARS-2000, the market is gonna have a bad time. is it priced in? no. Meanwhile: plenty of countries looking at hyperinflation (south america, turkey, russia). Meanwhile: plenty of countries looking at stupidly priced housing markets due to collapse (Canada, Australia, NZ, UK, much of Europe, China, Taiwan...).

Remember Evergrande from last year, the Chinese property company with the biggest debts of any company on the planet? That hasn't gone away! People are just ignoring it as it slowly plays out. There's just a lot of really bad shit playing out in the background and not a lot of good shit to balance it out.

Though I'll admit: seeing Europe, USA, UK, Japan, Australia, etc coming together re: Russia/Ukraine? That's encouraging! That bodes well for the future, the more these important countries work together and try to do the right thing even when it's costly to do so. Democracy bros gotta be true bros, because there's a lot of bad bros out there. Oh and while it's in my mind, though I've been a bit dismayed at the state of the USA in the last decade, I have to say, you guys are certainly doing some great things lately in helping Ukraine defend itself. Nice one!

# The dollar is probably overvalued and if it weakens, inflation will go even higher in the USA.

There is an idea in the currency markets that real rates impact currency value. Assuming two countries were of similar attractiveness, you'd be better investing in the one giving the most return on your capital after taxes &amp; inflation. Yet real rates in the USA are awful just now! The dollar is completely mispriced in my view. Having said that, short term it will probably continue to strengthen for the simple reason that 'in times of crisis, capital flees to perceived safety'. i.e. in the short term, in a crisis, 'return of capital' becomes more important than 'return on capital'. But long term? Ouch.

One of the problem of investing in US value stocks is that value stocks take typically years to play out, and in that timeframe you are maybe looking at a large loss on an overvalued currency. It might not even be possible to make money as a value investor outside the USA just now because of currency effects, unless you have a currency hedge. US investors may not care, but europoors should beware. This is already almost the worst time in 20 years for a european to be buying dollars. Check out the EURUSD rate on a 20 year chart. Yikes.

# Crypto

I was reading that young people nowadays prefer buying crypto to stocks or gold as a long term investment. e.g. [https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/03/investing/india-cryptocurrency-investing-future-hnk-intl/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/03/investing/india-cryptocurrency-investing-future-hnk-intl/index.html)

Let's be real. Somewhere between 98 and 100% of crypto coins are completely, hopelessly worthless. Probably 100%. It's like religion when you're an atheist: the reason I don't believe in *your* god, is probably the same as the reason you don't believe in 1000 other religion's gods. No special exceptions for your favourite crypto, sorry.

Considering e.g. Tether, I can't help but think the best epic-scale rugpull is still to come. People are only in crypto for the hope of rapid, massive gains yet they pretend it's 'about to be adopted as money'. It ain't happening guys. It's been 12 years now since Buttcorn came along and no one is using it as money.

Even *you* don't really use it as money. And if it ever did start acting like money, it won't produce 'gains'. If it produces 'gains', it can't be used as money. That's the thing about money; if it becomes an asset it stops being money. Even if crypto WAS money - and it's not, specifically because there's no tax system to physically enforce continual demand, and tax systems are what makes money-like into money - 'bad money drives out good', that's Gresham's law. The only thing keeping the crypto game going is the warm oxytocin glow of the bubbles, mania, euphoria in everything, the low rates.

Wait till you can't pay to keep the heating on in winter. Wait till you can't afford fuel for your car to get to work. Wait till the bank sends their final demand for payment. Then you'll find out who's a HODLer, who 'believes in the crypto dream'.

# Repent, ye bulls!

It's never to late to realise you have possibly fucked up and decide to become a bear or a kangaroo. Times change; models of investing that worked in the past may not work in the future and you won't be warned when the change is happening, when you are entering dangerous waters, when the tornado is about to arrive. Underwater caves are filled with the skeletons of skilled open-water divers. \[1\]

Remember, you don't need to always be in the market. It's OK to hold cash for a while, even with inflation devaluing it. Just ask any netflix shareholder.

Look at the 1970s, I think it might be a good model for what comes next. Sure, 8-10% inflation. But the stock market was a kangaroo market regardless, you could trade in and out of stocks/cash every few months that entire decade and still do far better than anyone who held only-cash or only-stocks the entire period.

\[1\] the film version of Ender's Game is awful, but there is one scene that is good, watch the scene where Ender meets Mazer Rackham. You are Ender, the market is Mazer Rackham.

# Fin

Well I hope someone found this interesting. If it made you very annoyed, you should probably reflect on why that is, it probably says more about you and the risks you're taking, than it does about this post.

I wish all of you good luck because, to be blunt, we're all going to need it, me included. Thankfully there are still niches in the market where the tired investor can find peace and comfort, rare areas of well-priced shares with OK growth potential and decent economic prospects.

I'm not going to tell you where they are, because I spend hours every day looking for them, and lately, it's been like finding an oasis in the desert when I find some. But times change, hopefully in a few months, we will see the rains arrive and the desert bloom, and the bears and kangaroos and value investors can all dance together with joy in a beautiful paradise of good stocks at good prices. Talking of deserts...

# I met a traveller from an antique land,

# Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone

# Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,

# Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,

# And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,

# Tell that its sculptor well those passions read

# Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,

# The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;

# And on the pedestal, these words appear:

# My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;

# Look on my Netflix 500C gains, ye Mighty, and despair!

# Nothing beside remains. Round the decay

# Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare

# The lone and level sands stretch far away.”",122,78,SeaweedSignificant84,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ul3wo8/repost_bear_facts/,ul3wo8

JPM Chair of Market and Investment Strategy Michael Cembalest says ""ignore all the hype"" in the energy transition (to renewable energy), ""with energy demand still in excess of supply, I believe the MSCI Global Energy Composite will outperform both renewable energy stocks and the broad equity market (SPY) again over the next year.""   

He asks: ""The IEA projects that the world may still be 66% reliant on fossil fuels in 2050. What gives?"" 

The points of his explantion: 

* Energy technology can't be disrupted in the same way that other new tech can disrupt old tech. After two decades of solar and wind investment, renewables have only captured ~5% of the global primary energy market. Electric cars are still only ~2% of the global vehicle fleet. We're experiencing energy shocks and shortages due to the attempt to force an end to investing in hydrocarbons, rather than a fast track to renewable energy.

* ""Much of the reduction in carbon intensity throughout the US and Europe has come as a result of exporting carbon-intensive work to the developing world.""

* ""[""Levelized cost"" of energy calculations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levelized_cost_of_energy) mislead investors and the public about technology's impact on the full cycle cost for intermittent sources of energy.""

* ""Commercialized low-carbon energy solutions focus on a very narrow piece of the primary energy pie.""

In response to fact that energy stocks have lagged in the past couple of decades, Cembalist explains that it's not because old energy has been successfully constrained and is becoming redundant due to renewable energy. Energy stocks have lagged because of their leaderships' misguided focus on high/increasing production (implying that doing so burdened them with high capital equipment costs and low commodity prices/low profit margins). 

&gt; ""Energy stocks have performed poorly because fossil fuel producers have focused on growth rather than returns. It's unclear whether ESG policies, perceived irrelevance, or the near-death experience of the pandemic changed attitudes in fossil fuel producer board rooms. However, attitudes have changed, fossil fuel producers are no longer growing at all costs, and as a result, the outlook for oil, gas, and coal equities globally has never looked brighter.""",15,1,rhetorical_twix,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/uikr4y/the_msci_global_energy_composite_will_outperform/,uikr4y

2022-05-03 20:49:37,r/stocks,'Wall Street sees greater risk of default by major banks',"May 3 (Reuters) - Reporting by Mehnaz Yasmin in Bengaluru; Editing by Alden Bentley and Anil D'Silva

The cost to insure bonds of Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Citigroup (C.N) against default hit two-year highs on Monday on growing fears the U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressive moves to tame inflation might tip the economy into recession.
Credit risks have worsened since the Ukraine crisis as some big U.S. banks took a hit to their mainstay businesses, with capital market activity coming to a standstill and lending expected to remain lackluster.

That has prompted bondholders to consider hedging strategies to protect against potential defaults.

The war in Ukraine and Western sanctions could knock more than 1% off global growth this year and add two and a half percentage points to inflation, the OECD has said.
JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N), Goldman Sachs and Citigroup combined put aside a $3.36 billion in credit loss reserves in the first quarter. That is a reversal from the past 12 months when lenders released billions in reserves after losses related to COVID-19 failed to materialize.

Spreads on five-year credit default swaps (CDS) on Goldman Sachs closed at $108.92 on Monday, Morgan Stanley at $104.96 and Citigroup at $107.94, their highest in at least two years.

CDS is a contractual agreement that lets buyers swap credit risk with sellers and thus insures bondholders against default.
Spreads on five-year CDS on JP Morgan , Wells Fargo and Bank of America Corp also look set to exceed near two-year highs set in March.

""Any short-term spike in CDS on U.S. banks is likely related to fears over a Russian default,"" said Thomas J. Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital in New York.

The correlation co-efficient between Russia's five-year CDS RUGV5YUSAC=R on sovereign debt and the banks' CDS is between 0.5 and 0.6 in the five months ended May this year, suggesting a strong positive correlation.
A derivatives panel has ruled on Wednesday that Russia could be in default after it failed to make a payment due on April 4 in U.S. dollars on two sovereign bonds, bringing a payout on billions of dollars in default insurance a step closer.

* I'm not from finance background and was wondering how this factors into the current state of the economy. Any ideas?

# **Big banks’ earnings and a hot inflation report could sway markets in short holiday week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/08/big-banks-earnings-and-a-hot-inflation-report-could-sway-markets-in-short-holiday-week.html)**
*****
&gt; Markets face what could be a hot inflation report in the week ahead and a batch of big bank earnings to start the earnings season.
*****
&gt; JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock kick off the financial industry’s first-quarter earnings releases Wednesday, with Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs reporting Thursday.
*****
&gt; The war in Ukraine will remain a focus, as investors look for any signs of change in the crisis.
*****
&gt; Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, said the first-quarter earnings reports from the financial sector will be important to a market considering the impact of the Federal Reserve’s plans to raise interest rates and aggressively tighten policy.
*****
&gt; “We want to get a picture of how do they see the Fed’s plan... quantitative tightening, the liquidity drain, coupled with higher rates, affecting their clients and their business units,” said Krosby. “If you look at the XLF [Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF], on days it goes up, it’s the insurance companies because they’re raising premiums. Higher rates are good for banks, until, the belief is, the higher rates are going to hurt the economy.”
*****
&gt; For the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3%, but the interest rate-sensitive Nasdaq Composite was down 3.9% and the S&amp;P 500 was off 1.3%. For a third week in a month, the jump in the 10-year Treasury yield topped 30 basis points, according to Wells Fargo’s Michael Schumacher. A basis point equals 0.01%.
*****
&gt; The 10-year rose above 2.7% on Friday.
*****
&gt; “It’s been on jet fuel,” said Schumacher. He said the 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, got a boost in the past week from the Fed’s signal that it is planning to trim its balance sheet by $95 billion a month, of which about $60 billion will be in Treasurys.
*****
&gt; The 10-year is important as a benchmark and also because it is a rate that affects mortgages and other loans.
*****
&gt; “People are saying the balance sheet is going to cause the 10s to move quite a bit,” said Schumacher. He said he could not rule out a move in the yield to 3%, given the speed at which the yield has moved recently.
*****
&gt; Economic data in the coming week could be a catalyst for another move higher.
*****
&gt; The four-day holiday week is packed with economic reports. Some will be released on the Good Friday market holiday. The highlight is Tuesday’s report of March’s consumer price index, which is expected to top the 7.9% reported for February.
*****
&gt; “It’s big. It’s the last key data point before the Fed meets May 3,” said Schumacher. A hot number, even in line with expectations, will encourage the market to expect a 50-basis-point hike, or a half percent, from the Fed at that meeting. The Fed began its rate hiking cycle in March with a quarter-point increase.
*****
&gt; The producer price index is set for release on Wednesday. Data on retail sales and consumer sentiment are due Thursday. On the Friday market holiday, Empire state manufacturing and industrial production are released.
*****
&gt; Barclays economists expect CPI rose 1.24% in March, gaining a stunning 8.5% year-over-year, the highest in 40 years. “We expect the annual rate of CPI to peak in March and move lower thereon, aided by positive base effects,” the economists wrote.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures deflator is released April 29, but CPI and PPI will both set the tone for that report.
*****
&gt; “We’ve had such a sharp move in yields. Sentiment is so dour in rates, I wouldn’t be surprised if we got a relief rally in rates after we see the March CPI,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.
*****
&gt; “While inflation pressures are still going to be here, I think March would be the peak inflation rate on a rate of change basis... You could get some rotation [in stocks] next week if you get a bond bounce,” said Boockvar.
*****
&gt; Schumacher said the bond market will also be watching the Bank of Canada for an expected rate hike when it meets Wednesday, and the European Central Bank for comments on its bond purchases at its Thursday meeting.
*****
&gt; # Earnings season
According to Refinitiv, S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to be up 6.1% in the first quarter, but the financial sector is expected to see a decline of 22.9%.
*****
&gt; LPL’s Krosby expects to see choppy trading. “I think it’s going to be a difficult quarter,” she said. She said investors will be watching to see how the market absorbs a 50-basis-point hike. Quantitative tightening, balance sheet reductions known as QT, is also a policy tightening.
*****
&gt; “The QT could start next month. There’s a sense [the Fed] can’t wait any longer,” she said.
*****
&gt; Krosby said she recommends a defensive focus, favoring consumer staples, real estate investment trusts and health care, as well as consumer discretionary names that emphasize cost savings for consumers.

&gt; “I suspect at the end of next week, with the long weekend ahead, people will want to cut risk, but I suspect it could be a pretty rocky ride with CPI before we see that,” said Schumacher.

&gt; # Treasuries Yields Blow Past Dividend Yields

&gt; US Treasury yields have experienced a dramatic move higher as the market prices in continued rate hikes in the near future. With the increase in long-term Treasury yields, we're starting to see what looks like the end of a period where the S&amp;P 500 and the 10-year Treasury fought back and forth over which asset class had a more attractive yield.

&gt; As shown in the chart below, from 1970 right up to the period before the global financial crisis, the 10-year yield consistently yielded more than the S&amp;P 500. As the Fed cut rates to zero during the crisis, though, the S&amp;P 500 went on to see multiple periods where its dividend yield was in excess of the 10-year Treasury yield. With the recent surge in yields as the Fed embarks on what the market expects to be an aggressive rate hiking cycle, the script has been completely flipped. The 10-year now offers a roughly 125 bps higher yield than the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield which is the widest spread since the fall of 2018 and before that, the fall of 2011. As the spread between the S&amp;P 500 dividend yield and 10-year Treasury yield hits the low end of the GFC/post-GFC era, we would note that current levels are still roughly 200 bps higher than the historical average going back to 1970.

&gt; # Bulls Head for the Hills Once Again

&gt; After peaking at 32.8% two weeks ago, bullish sentiment continues to roll over as the S&amp;P 500 has erased some of the March gains this week. After this week's decline of 7.2 percentage points in bullish sentiment, less than a quarter of respondents reported as bullish. While low, that is still a few percentage points above the weaker levels from February.

&gt; ###### **([https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-Bulls.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment in turn rose 13.9 percentage points which was the biggest one-week uptick since August 2019 when it rose 24.14 percentage points. At 41.4%, bearish sentiment is now at the highest level since the week of March 17th. That is an elevated reading and a big move week over week, but it is also well off recent highs from the past few months that were more than 10 percentage points higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-Bears.png))**

&gt; The bull-bear spread tipped into positive territory for the first time in 2022 last week, but the big inverse moves between bulls and bears erased much of the past few weeks' move. The spread is down to -16.7 which is still 13.6 points above the late February low of -30.3.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

&gt; The big pickup in the number of respondents reporting as bearish didn't entirely come from the bullish camp. Neutral sentiment also shed a significant amount falling from 40.6% last week to 33.9%. That is essentially mean reversion as neutral sentiment now sits only a couple of points above the historical average.

&gt; # Near Record Low in Jobless Claims

&gt; This week's jobless claims release was significant in a couple of ways. For starters, the Department of Labor revised seasonal adjustment factors (more on that below) and second, the most recent print for the seasonally adjusted number hit one of the lowest levels on record. Claims came in at 166K which tied the number from two weeks ago (after revisions) for the second-lowest reading on record behind the week of 11/29/68. That week's reading was only 4K lower.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; As for continuing claims, this week's reading was higher rising from 1.506 million to 1.523 million. Having come off last week's low, that remains one of the strongest levels since 1970.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/04/040722-Con-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; Pivoting back to initial claims, while adjusted claims are at multi-decade lows, non-seasonally adjusted claims are very healthy but not quite at a record. At current levels of 193.1K, the only year with a lower reading for the comparable week of the year was 1969 (170K) but at the seasonal lows in the few years prior to the pandemic, claims were even stronger than they are now. So while unadjusted claims are strong, the seasonally adjusted number was even more eyecatching this week.

&gt; As for why the seasonally adjusted number appears so much stronger, as shown in the second chart below, the current week of the year has historically been the second most consistent week of the year in seeing a week-over-week increase in claims. As a period with consistent seasonal headwinds, the seasonal adjustment would control for this by depressing the level of claims by a relatively strong seasonal factor. That usual increase was not seen this year as NSA claims were actually slightly lower falling from 196.8K to 193.1K. That means seasonal adjustment helped out what was already a strong number.

&gt; Additionally worth noting this week is the DOL changed its seasonal adjustment methodology. The DOL fully describes the change in this week's release and links to further reading on the topic for those interested in going deeper into the weeds, but to briefly summarize: periods when the level of an economic indicator experiences historic shifts in levels as claims did in 2020 and 2021, multiplicative adjustment (which has been used in ""normal times"" like prior to the pandemic and from here forward) would tend to over or understate adjusted claims. Additive adjustment, on the other hand, is less affected by the actual level of the indicator meaning it would lead to more accurate approximations of seasonally adjusted numbers in times of sudden spikes in the series. This methodology has been used throughout the pandemic period. Now that claims have more or less returned to a more normal range of readings, the DOL sees it justifiable to switch the seasonal adjustment methodology back to multiplicative. While that does not mean too much for interpreting claims, that change in methodology has led to some large downward revisions.

&gt; # 10 Things To Know About Inverted Yield Curves

&gt; One of the biggest stories over the past few weeks has been the inversion of various points on the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The more well-known 2-year/10-year yield curve spread inverted on April 1, 2022 for the first time since 2019, while the 5-year/30-year inverted for the first time since 2006 on March 28.

&gt; What is a yield curve? The yield curve plots the yield of different maturity bonds, usually Treasuries. In normal times, a longer dated bond should have a higher yield than a shorter dated bond. Historically, after key parts of the yield curve invert, the economy eventually has moved into a recession. This is why these signals are quiet important.

&gt; Here are ten things to know about the yield curve.

&gt; * Yes, past recessions have been proceeded by an inverted yield curve, but by no means does it happen right away. Another way to put it is yield curve inversions have preceded all recessions, but not all inverted yield curves lead to a recession. Historically, when the 2-year/10-year yield curve inverts, a recession has taken place an average about 19 months later.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-4.5.22.png))**

&gt; * What about stocks? “One of the bigger surprises for investors is that stocks historically have actually done quite well after previous inversions,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, the S&amp;P 500 Index gained another 29% on average and peaked nearly 17 months later after the previous four inversions.” The bottom line is a yield curve inversion is a warning sign, but by no means does that mean trouble is coming immediately.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-2-4.5.22.png))**

&gt; * In the LPL Research Chart of the Day (shown below), here is how the S&amp;P 500 has done after all the 2-year/10-year inversions going back to the mid-1960s. Once again, some of the more recent performance has been quite impressive.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog-3-4.5.22.png))**

&gt; * One thing investors seem to be ignoring lately though is the short-end of the curve. In fact, the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) came out recently saying as much in Don’t Fear the Yield Curve. They concluded that the 2-year/10-year yield curve wasn’t a good indicator for recessions; instead the near-term spread between the 3-month/18-month forward yield curve has been much better. Take note that the 3-month/18-month forward yield curve has steepened significantly the past few months, reducing the chances of a recession. Speaking of the Fed, Chairman Powell said last month that the economy was on firm footing and would be able to withstand rate hikes. In other words, the Fed isn’t worried about a recession quite yet.

&gt; * Along these lines, the 3-month/10-year yield curve recently was at its steepest level in 5 years! This has been our personal favorite part of the yield curve to use as a signal for a pending recession (as the 2-year/10-year has given false signals before) and if and until this curve inverts, we believe the odds of a recession on the horizon is limited.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-4-4.5.22.png))**

&gt; * Yield curves are one part of the bond market, but what the credit markets are saying is another (think of them as bond investors take on financial conditions) and we see a much different opinion here. Lately, high yield bonds have outperformed Treasuries ( Bloomberg US Corporate High Yield index and the Bloomberg US Treasury index), a clue the credit markets weren’t very worried about economic growth going forward. In the past, trouble starts brewing when high yield underperforms Treasuries.

&gt; * Adding to this, spreads on high yield and investment grade corporates have both come back significantly the past few weeks. “To see credit markets showing major signs of improvement the past few weeks is a great sign that financial conditions are probably better than most think,” explained Detrick. “Yes, the yield curve is flashing some warnings, but overall the credit markets are saying don’t get overly worried just yet.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog-5-4.5.22.png))**

&gt; * Real rates (rates adjusted for inflation) are negative. With the 10-year breakeven rate, what the bond market thinks inflation will average over the next 10 years, currently near 2.8% and the 10-year Treasury yield currently near 2.5%, real yields are actually negative. Historically, negative real rates have been quite bullish for risk assets. The Roaring 1920s, then during the 1940s and 1950s, were the last time we saw an extended period of negative real rates. As history told us, those decades saw explosive growth and stock market gains.

&gt; * Real yield curves (adjusted for inflation) are still upwardly sloping. Take note, we’ve seen real yields invert ahead of recessions in the past along with nominal yield curves (2006 and 2019 most recently), yet another clue a recession might not be as close as some fear. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs noted that nominal curves tend to invert more easily in high inflation environments (we can check this box now), suggesting it would take a deeper inversion than recent cycles to trigger a recession signal.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog-6-4.5.22.png))**

&gt; * Lastly, the Fed owns nearly $9 trillion in bonds and 25% of the entire Treasury market. Who knows where yields would be if they didn’t own any, but most agree longer-term yields would likely be much higher. So maybe various yield curves wouldn’t be inverted or even that close to inverting? This concept is mere conjecture, but it is a note we’ve seen lately that is at least worth pointing out.

&gt; There is a lot to digest here and this isn’t an easy subject, but the bottom line is the takeaway isn’t as simple as an inverted yield curve means a recession is imminent.

&gt; # April’s Stellar Track Record

&gt; April has been nearly perfect with gains steadily building from the first trading day to the last with only the occasional and minor blip along the way. DJIA has been up 16 Aprils in a row with an average gain of 2.9%. S&amp;P 500 has been up 15 of the last 16 Aprils with an average gain of 3.1%

&gt; April is last month of the Best Six Months November-April and when we begin tracking our Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Sell Signal. But before the “Worst Months” arrive, April’s solid historical track record could keep the current rally intact.

&gt; April got off to its usual stellar start the first two trading days of the month, but some surprisingly hawkish remarks from the usually dovish Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard has stocks on the ropes today.

&gt; Barring any major escalation in Ukraine, we suspect the market to log additional gains in April as the Best Six Months come to a close and then move sideways during much of Q2 and Q3. Likely testing the lows before rallying in Q4 and into 2023.

&gt; Our “Best Six Months” switching strategy found in our annual Stock Trader’s Almanac which is basically the flipside of the old “sell in May and Go Away” adage. After decades of historical research, we discovered that most market gains occur during the months November through April. Investing in the Dow Jones Industrial Average between November 1st and April 30th each year and then switching into fixed income for the other six months has produced reliable returns with reduced risk since 1950.

C, JPM, WFC, TD, BLK....","I've always preferred to stay best of breed in this sector (JPM), but WFC was too tempting in the 20s.  I've since exited that position, but we're now seeing much of the overall sector pull back.

Citi's dividend is now well over 4%.  Morningstar is touting it strongly, with a $78 target.

&gt; Bulls Say

&gt; Citigroup is in the middle of a strategic repositioning, making major moves such as selling off its consumer business in Mexico and reinvesting in its strong points: investment and corporate banking and wealth. Citigroup may finally emerge as a structurally improved franchise.

&gt; Citigroup remains uniquely exposed to card loan growth and global transaction and trade volume. As card loans eventually rebound and the global economy recovers, this should drive revenue growth for the bank.

# [Stock futures are little changed to start the week](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/03/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. stock index futures were mostly flat Monday, as traders monitor the bond market’s warning signals about the economy.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded marginally higher. S&amp;P 500 futures were up about 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.3%.
*****
&gt; Twitter shares surged more than 25% after SEC filings revealed Elon Musk purchased a more than 9% passive stake in the social media company. It comes less than a week after Musk polled his followers, questioning whether the social media giant follows free speech principles. Based on Twitter’s Friday closing price, the stake is worth $2.89 billion.
*****
&gt; Tesla shares ticked higher by 1%, after the company reported on Saturday its latest quarterly electric vehicle delivery figures. The company delivered more than 310,000 EVs in the first quarter, up from 184,800 in the year-earlier period.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, Starbucks shares dipped about 1% after the coffee chain suspended its share repurchase program.
*****
&gt; An often-cited recession signal was triggered Thursday evening when the the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields inverted for the first time since 2019. The 5-year note yield is also trading above its 30-year counterpart.
*****
&gt; “We think the current flattening is due to the concern that the Fed is behind the curve on hikes and will tighten policy beyond neutral, which will hurt growth,” TD Securities said in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; Investors are also monitoring the latest developments in Ukraine. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Sunday that Western nations will impose additional sanctions on Russia in the coming days.
*****
&gt; “Equity and bond markets continued to send conflicting signals about the economic outlook,” UBS said in a recent note to clients. “We caution against over-interpreting either signal. Yield curve inversions have historically predicted recessions with a long and uncertain lag, while hopes over cease-fire talks have ebbed and flowed,” the firm added.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a winning session, with the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq all posting gains Friday. The S&amp;P 500 also posted its third straight week of gains.
*****
&gt; Seasonally, April is generally one of the best months for stocks, edging higher in the last 20 years by 2.41% on average, MKM Partners’ JC O’Hara wrote in a note. Within 16 of the last 17 Aprils, the S&amp;P has also inched higher.
*****
&gt; Friday’s positive session came despite March’s employment report, which fell short of economists’ estimates. The U.S. economy added 431,000 jobs during the month, while estimates from Dow Jones called for 490,000.
*****
&gt; “Strong gains on the employment front continue to signal a green light for investors despite multi-decade highs in inflation and concerns over higher rates and Fed tightening,” noted Peter Essele, head of portfolio management for Commonwealth Financial Network. “The economy appears to be in exit velocity mode, with the only concern being the amount of labor supply available to fuel the robust recovery,” he added.
*****
&gt; On Wednesday the Federal Open Market Committee will publish the minutes from the central bank’s March meeting, giving investors a deeper understanding into how the Fed views market conditions.

3/9/18
9/21/18
2/14/20 (the big one - covid)
8/28/20
2/12/21
etc.

so determine the % drop from those highs to their subsequent next lows to give you a range of when to add in the present. 

So if it dropped roughly 20% on those dates, then buy now if its around 20% down from a high. MSFT is down about 17% from 12/10/21 high. 

But that is still like trying to time the market i guess...like if msft was 100 dollars today and at an ath, and continued up to 150 before then dropping 20% to 120, i would have been better off buyiing at the 100 ath instead of getting a deal on the ""dip""

I also would include Enphase here because of their continuously outstanding financials and strong projections.

On the more speculative side of my portfolio I would put my small cap and growth ETFs such as qqqj and scha as well as clean energy like ICLN and TAN (enphase is the standout star, I find the rest more speculative).

&amp;#x200B;

The first three are well discussed on the website. They even discuss how they could be wrong in many ways. I think they show that the market can go way lower than it already is. One thing that the first three miss is the huge influx of new trades over the past few years. IMO this makes the fair P/E ratio a little higher yet it would likely make the market much more volatile. This means that current dip could still go much lower. It also may mean that we are just seeing wide swings because of newer traders doing what they do. I prefer the former.

Vixcentral has been one of my go to indicators to judge market sentiment. It doesn't seem to tell you when the market is going to dip but the charts seem to be good at showing when the market has calmed and may be time for another good re-entry. Currently we're in backwardation showing that we are still in a rough market.

The spx put call ratio is something people have used for years. It's currently pretty low considering where it has been over the past few weeks which means the market could be settling.

The CEO responded:

&gt;Like Jeremy was talking about the card stuff, the return, I told our folks that we’re going to -- our card growth this year, but they were skeptical. The American consumer is very strong. Our products and services are very good. Chase, we call now self-directed investing has $55 billion. I think Robinhood has, I think, 80, the last time I saw, something like that. We’re not seeing your -- bragging about our product because I would say it’s not good enough yet. But it’s got $55 billion without us doing virtually anything and or no marketing and no real stuff like that. So, there’s a lot of stuff coming. The competition, we have to face. Some of these acquisitions we made will contribute to profit, maybe not exactly in 2022. But -- and I mentioned the **deployment of the balance sheet**. We’re pretty conservative in deploying the balance sheet. That may not always be true.”

A couple of questions:

* What does ""deploying the balance sheet"" mean? 

* What is your overall take on this call. JPM seemed pretty evasive about how much return one could expect from these sky high expenses.

Stocks ended the day mixed in another highly volatile session, with both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) pushing sharply higher in the last hour of the session to close higher after trading in the red most of the day. 

Market participants digested the latest CPI and PPI numbers, new commentary by Fed Governor Lael Brainard, and newly released monthly US retail sales report and a mixed set of earnings reports from big banks.

**Markets Today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +0.05%

US retail sales slumped by the most in 10 months, suggesting that the current pace of inflation coupled with surging Omicron infections are taking their toll on consumer spending. As a reminder, consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP.

The Department of Commerce reported that US retail sales decreased -1.9% in December, slumping after a revised +0.2% in November, and greatly missing the -0.01% drop expected by economists. 

10 of the 13 retail categories showed declines in receipts last month, led by non-store retailers, which includes e-commerce. Those sales plummeted 8.7% from a month earlier.

Department-store receipts decreased 7% after a 5.5% drop in November. Sales at furniture stores, electronics outlets, and sporting goods establishments also fell.

Receipts at restaurants and bars, the report’s only services-oriented category and a sign of omicron’s early impact, dropped 0.8% after rising the prior month.

Motor vehicle sales declined 0.4%. Automakers last year struggled to meet demand as production efforts were hampered by shortages of semiconductors are parts. The result was fewer vehicles on dealer lots and limited choices for buyers.

The government’s report showed retail sales, excluding volatile gasoline and motor vehicles prices, slumped -2.5% in December.

Here is the full retail sales report: [https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts\_current.pdf](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf)

In her confirmation hearing before Congress, newly re-elected Fed Governor Lael Brainard suggested the central bank could begin raising interest rates — a move that would tighten financial conditions and help bring down inflation — ""as soon as asset purchases are terminated."" The Federal Reserve is currently set to end its asset-purchase tapering process in March. 

Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ December producer price index (PPI) showed a 9.7% year-over-year increase in prices paid by producers, the biggest jump since 2010. Core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, came in at 8.3%.

Matthew Miskin, co-Chief Investment Strategist at John Hancock Investment Managemen, said “Two of the biggest things have been the supply chain disruptions and the fiscal stimulus. As the pandemic comes more under control this year, as the Omicron wave hopefully dissipates, we likely see the supply chain disruptions come off, and then we’re not going to get more fiscal stimulus ... That in our view does cause inflation to come down over the course of the year."" 

Earnings season is kicking off, with big financial institutions reporting earnings this morning. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) shares fell more than 5% after the company [posted lower-than-expected fourth-quarter ](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/investor-relations/documents/quarterly-earnings/2021/4th-quarter/ae462261-4964-48c6-b947-4b69963d1143.pdf)trading revenues and rising costs as compensation expenses increased. The stock drop marked JPMorgan's worst post-earnings decline since 2011. Citigroup (C) shares also fell after posting a similar miss on fixed-income and equities trading revenues for the quarter.  Wells Fargo (WFC) shares rose, on the other hand, after [posting quarterly revenue](https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/earnings/fourth-quarter-2021-earnings.pdf) that topped estimates as both commercial and consumer loans picked up at the end of last year. 

**Highlights**

* The Biden administration announced its nominees to fill out the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, tapping Sarah Bloom Raskin, Lisa Cook, and Philip Jefferson for the roles. Each nominee must still go before the Senate Banking Committee for confirmation.
* According to new Federal Reserve data Friday, manufacturing output declined by 0.3% in December to reverse course after a 0.6% rise in November. Consensus economists were looking for a 0.3% monthly rise in production in December, based on Bloomberg data. Manufacturing accounts for about 12% of overall economic activity in the U.S. 
* The [University of Michigan's preliminary January Surveys of Consumers index](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/) came in at 68.8, falling from December's 70.6. This was below consensus estimates for a reading of 70.0, according to Bloomberg data. 
* Starbucks (SBUX) employees at three more restaurants in New York state will vote on unionization, a U.S. labor official ruled Friday.
* The U.S. auto safety regulator said on Friday that it is discussing the heating issues of some Tesla vehicles with the automaker and evaluating ""potential safety concerns.""
* Investors piled into stocks and ditched cash, gold and bonds, especially safe haven ones, in the week to Wednesday, BofA said in its weekly flow tracking note published on Friday. Equity funds attracted $30.5 billion while bond funds suffered their first outflow in four weeks at $2.9 billion, cash funds lost $43.5 billion, and gold at $100 million, BofA said in its note based on EPFR data.
* Microsoft is investing $50 million in a LanzaJet facility in Georgia that will produce jet fuel from ethanol next year, LanzaJet said.

Still, new filings remain near pre-pandemic levels. Continuing jobless claims improved to their lowest level since 1973. Here are the numbers:

* **Initial jobless claims:** 230,000 vs. 200,000 expected and an unrevised 207,000 during prior week
* **Continuing claims:** 1.559 million vs. 1.733 million expected and a revised 1.753 million during prior week

Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ December producer price index (PPI) showed a 9.7% year-over-year increase in prices paid by producers, the biggest jump since 2010. Core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, came in at 8.3%.

Omar Aguilar, Chief Investment Officer at Charles Schwab Asset Management, said “The inflation picture obviously is something that people are trying to understand — the concept of PPI and the fact that we're getting ... numbers that we haven't seen in quite some time. The labor market seems to continue to be very tight and very strong, and I think investors are trying to understand what the implications might be for the reaction of the central bank.”

The PPI comes the day after the Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed that prices for consumer goods rose 7.0% year-over-year, the fastest pace of inflation since 1982. CPI matched consensus estimates and showed a minor acceleration compared to November 6.8% print.

By category, prices for used cars and trucks and shelter were the largest contributors to the headline increase. The used cars and trucks index rose for a third straight month and accelerated to a 3.5% month-on-month rise in December from November's 2.5% increase. This index was also higher by a marked 37.3% compared to the same month last year. Shelter prices rose 0.4%.  

The core measure of consumer price changes, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 5.5% in December over last year, representing the fastest increase since 1991. This accelerated from a 4.9% annual gain in November.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, January 11, 2022**

After one of the wildest days I’ve experienced in the market, stocks carried on yesterday’s momentum, with all three major indexes advancing as market participants digested new testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. 

**Markets Today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +0.91%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +1.52%
* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.50%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +1.05%
* Volatility Index (VIX): -5.05%
* Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): +4.02%
* Sea Limited (SE): +6.01%
* Albertsons (ACI): -9.56%
* Virgin Orbit (VORB): +27.83%
* Shake Shack (SHAK): +12.14%
* Amazon (AMZN): +2.40%

During his confirmation hearing before Congress, Powell said the US economy was healthy enough to support a reduction in the accommodative monetary policy that has propped up the markets for the last two years. This means putting an end to quantitative easing and raising the interest rate.

He said, “As we move through this year … if things develop as expected, we’ll be normalizing policy, meaning we’re going to end our asset purchases in March, meaning we’ll be raising rates over the course of the year. At some point perhaps later this year we will start to allow the balance sheet to run off, and that’s just the road to normalizing policy.”

Powell reiterated that the Central Bank was prepared to act if the pace of inflation does not begin to moderate in the coming months. He said, “If we see inflation persisting at high levels, longer than expected, if we have to raise interest rates more over time, then we will.”

Powell said the moves are in response to an economy with a strong labor market, with an unemployment rate of 3.9% in December, but elevated inflation. Powell said, “What that \[the unemployment rate coupled with elevated inflation\] is really telling us is that the economy no longer needs or wants the very highly accommodative policies that we’ve had in place to deal with the pandemic and its aftermath. We’re really just going to be moving over the course of this year to a policy that is closer to normal. But it’s a long road to normal from where we are.”

The Fed’s most potent tool remains interest rates, which the central bank has pinned to zero since the depths of the pandemic. Raising interest rates could address higher demand by making it more expensive to borrow. However, higher borrowing costs would not do much to address supply-side constraints and shipping bottlenecks that are greatly contributing to the rise in prices. Powell said, “We can affect the demand side, we can’t affect the supply side. But this really is a combination of the two.”

Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield, which reached a yearly higher at 1.8% yesterday, came down after Powell’s speech, hovering at 1.741% at the time of writing. 

Steven Wieting, Global Chief Investment Strategist at Citigroup, said “We’re seeing across the board a re-rating of what the Federal Reserve will do. The likelihood is very clear that the Fed will succeed in sinking inflation. That is going to happen one way or the other and we are just trying to gather how actively the Fed will be doing that.”

Regarding interest rate hikes, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he sees the Fed passing four rate hikes next year, one more than the currently telegraphed three. Speaking to CNBC, Dimon said, ""It's possible that inflation is worse than people think. I, personally, would be surprised if it's just four increases this year. Four would be very easy for the economy to absorb.""

Looking ahead, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release December’s Consumer Price Index Friday, which is currently expected to show a 7.0% jump in year-over-year prices, the largest jump since 1982. This could also spark more volatility. 

Moreover, at the end of the week, big financial institutions, including JP Morgan (JPM), Blackrock (BLK), Citigroup, and Wells Fargo (WFC) will earnings Friday morning before the opening bell.

**Highlights**

* Intel (INTC) analysts gave a nod of approval to the chipmaker on its move to recruit Micron’s (MU) David Zinsner to serve as Chief Financial Officer as part of a broader shakeup by CEO Pat Gelsinger. ""Intel now has a 'dream team,' with 'one of the best CEOs and one of the best CFOs in the semiconductor industry,'"" Citi analysts said. Zinsner ""has driven higher operating margins at every public company he has been CFO at.""
* The National Federation of Independent Business reported that its Small Business Optimism Index rose 0.5 point to 98.9 last month. Of small business owners who responded to the organization’s survey, 22% said inflation was their primary operating concern — up from 18% in November.
* Tesla Inc sold 70,847 China-made vehicles in December, the highest monthly rate since it started manufacturing in Shanghai in 2019, data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) showed on Tuesday.
* The U.S. judge hearing the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust case against Facebook said on Tuesday that he would not dismiss the government's lawsuit.
* Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank, is reducing overdraft fees from $35 to $10 starting in May and will stop charging overdraft fees in February.
* Twitter (TWTR) has become a minority stakeholder in digital advertising company Aleph. CEO of Aleph said, “We are honored to have Twitter as an investor in Aleph. Their investment is a clear endorsement of our efforts to educate a new generation of digital professionals equally around the globe.""
* Back Market, the French marketplace dedicated to refurbished smartphones and electronic devices, said on Tuesday it had closed an investment round of $510 million, bringing its total valuation to $5.7 billion.
* Nvidia is launching a new 12GB model of its RTX 3080 today. Revealed initially in Nvidia’s latest GeForce drivers, the new 12GB model goes on sale today from select board partners and offers 2GB more memory than the original 10GB RTX 3080.
* NVIDIA and Arm submitted a 28-page written submission to the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority outlining why the $40 billion acquisition should be approved. In it, both companies accuse critics of “romanticizing” Arm’s history, ignoring the company’s current financial condition, and overstating Arm’s market power. Arm’s energy-efficient chip designs are used in 95% of the world’s smartphones and 95% of the chips designed in China. 
* Block (SQ) is reportedly working on building its own application-specific integrated circuit designed to mine digital currencies.
* Amazon (AMZN) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $4000 to $4200. 
* Anthem (ANTM) target raised by Sanford Bernstein from $559 to $574
* Interactive Brokers (IBKR) target raised by Goldman Sachs from $81 to $96
* Fiserv (FISV) target raised by Raymond James from $111 to $122
* Mastercard (MA) target raised by Raymond James from $430 to $435
* UnitedHealth (UNH) target raised by Sanford Bernstein from $508 to $564

Today was one of the wildest days I’ve seen in the markets in a long time. After sinking more than 2.5% in the morning, the Nasdaq (QQQ) staged a remarkable red-to-green move as market participants piled in to buy the dip in technology stocks. This comes despite concerns about elevated inflation and anticipation that the Fed will likely raise interest rates “relatively soon”.

Significantly, volume in the tech-heavy Nasdaq was roughly double the average volume traded, with 90 million shares traded today, compared to an average volume of 46 million shares traded.

**Markets Today (listed from lowes of the day to closing price)**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -2.0% lowes, 0.12% close
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -2.70% lowes, +0.07% close
* Dow Jones (DIA): -1.56% lowes, -0.42% close
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -2.20% lowes, -0.35% close
* Volatility Index (VIX): +9.91% highs, +3.36 close

Last week, the Fed signaled that an interest rate hike could come “relatively soon”, sparking widespread volatility among technology and growth stocks. Moreover, the Fed’s comments resulted in a sharp rise in the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, further pressuring high growth stocks.

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunities to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. While higher yields are generally seen as a bet on a strengthening economic environment, it does make it more expensive to borrow capital, which weighs heavily on growth stocks, which are valued heavily based on future earnings projections.

Looking ahead, there are two big developments to keep in mind. On Tuesday, Jerome Powell will give his confirmation hearing to Congress (he was recently re-elected as Fed chair). He is expected to lay out to lawmakers his expectations for inflation moving forward and signal on what the Fed plans to do. His hearing could potentially spark volatility, so watch out for that.

In addition to Powell’s confirmation hearing, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release December’s Consumer Price Index, which is currently expected to show a 7.0% jump in year-over-year prices, the largest jump since 1982. This could also spark more volatility.

At the end of the week, big banks including JP Morgan (JPM), Citigroup, and Wells Fargo (WFC) will earnings Friday morning before the opening bell.

**Highlights**

* Wholesale inventories rose by 1.4% in the Commerce Department's final monthly print for November, coming in above the 1.2% rise previously reported. This came following a 2.5% increase in inventories in October.
* Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida [will leave the central bank](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20220110a.htm) two weeks earlier than planned, following increased scrutiny into financial transactions he made in 2020.

Speaking to CNBC, Dimon said, ""It's possible that inflation is worse than people think. I, personally, would be surprised if it's just four increases this year.

* Tesla Inc on Monday said it has signed its first U.S. supply deal for nickel, choosing Talon Metals Corp's Tamarack mine project in Minnesota. Tesla will buy 75,000 tonnes of nickel over six years and buy cobalt and iron ore as well.
* Ferrari unveiled leadership changes aimed at boosting technology as the company transitions to EVs and higher-end technology. Ernesto Lasalandra was hired from STMicroelectronics (STM) to become Ferrari's chief research and development officer, while Silvia Gabrielli, who joined Ferrari in 2019 from Microsoft (MSFT), was appointed chief digital and data officer.
* Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeted on Friday that the electric carmaker will raise the U.S. price of its advanced driver assistant software dubbed ""Full Self Driving"" to $12,000 on Jan. 17.
* Apple Inc supplier Foxconn will reopen its shuttered iPhone manufacturing facility in southern India on Jan. 12, government officials and a legislator in the region where the plant is located told Reuters. The plant has been closed for about a month following a worker’s strike.

I have TMO and UNH for example.  Healthcare is supposed to to well this year.

Or I could put it in JPM?

I could see PYPL falling to 150 if things get worse and I think financials energy and healthcare (or at least I'm told) will do better this year.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 10th, 2022.

# **Inflation, rising rates and the Federal Reserve could whip stocks around in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/07/inflation-rising-rates-and-the-federal-reserve-could-whip-stocks-around-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; The bond market could again set the course for the week ahead, after rapidly rising interest rates gave stocks a choppy start to the new year.
*****
&gt; In the coming week, key inflation reports are expected, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is slated to testify Tuesday at his nomination hearing before a Senate panel, while the hearing on Fed Governor Lael Brainard’s nomination to the post of vice chair is set for Thursday.
*****
&gt; The week also marks the start of the fourth-quarter earnings period with reports from major banks JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo on Friday.
*****
&gt; “Inflation and the Fed continue to be the theme next week, but I do think we’re looking forward to have some earnings results to sink our teeth into,” said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer of BNY Mellon Wealth Management. “We do think it’s going to be a good quarter and a good year for earnings, which is why we’re generally upbeat on the prospect for earnings.”
*****
&gt; Grohowski said the markets will focus predominantly on the Powell and Brainard hearings, the consumer price index on Wednesday and the producer price index the next day.
*****
&gt; “I think it’s unrealistic to assume the earnings become the page-one story, and the Fed monetary policy becomes the page-two story,” he said.
*****
&gt; Stocks had a rough first week to 2022, as bond yields rose on both high expectations for Fed interest rate hikes and the view that the omicron variant of Covid is heading for a peak in a matter of weeks. Yields move higher when bonds sell off.
*****
&gt; Tech was particularly hard hit, with the Nasdaq Composite down 4.5% for the week, while the Dow was barely negative, down just 0.3%. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund was off 4.6% as of Friday afternoon. But banks moved higher on the prospect that rising interest rates would help earnings. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund was up 5.4% for the week.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 4677, down 1.9%.
*****
&gt; “This week was a wake-up call for what we’re going to be dealing with for 2022,” said Grohowski. “Lower returns and more risk. Welcome to the new year.”
*****
&gt; Yields rose rapidly across the curve, but the dramatic move of the benchmark 10-year was particularly rattling for investors. The 10-year, which influences mortgages and other loans, rose from 1.51% in the final hour of 2021 trading to as high as 1.80% Friday.
*****
&gt; That makes it the second-biggest move in the yield for the first week of the year in 20 years, according to Wells Fargo.
*****
&gt; “It’s more dramatic than what we anticipated and the Fed’s pivot to a more hawkish stance has been the surprise,” said Grohowski. “Most market participants expected higher rates, less accommodative monetary policy, but when you look at the fed funds implying a 90% chance of a hike in March, on New Year’s Eve that was just 63%. There’s been a pretty dramatic change in tone picked up in the Fed minutes this week and markets are adjusting to that.”
*****
&gt; Powell’s hearing on Tuesday will be a highlight of the coming week, not because he is expected to make news, but because he is likely to echo the tone of the Fed minutes, released this past Wednesday.
*****
&gt; The central bank revealed in those minutes that officials are also discussing when to start shrinking its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet. The Fed has already forecast tightening policy with three quarter-point interest rate hikes this year, and downsizing its bond holdings would tighten it even further.
*****
&gt; Bond investors also reacted to the disappointing December jobs report Friday by sending interest rates higher. There were just 199,000 jobs created last month, less than half of what was expected. But the unemployment rate fell more than expected, to 3.9% from 4.2%. Average hourly wages rose by 0.6%, or 4.7% year over year.
*****
&gt; Economists blamed the weaker report in part on a lack of workers to fill jobs, but the Fed is expected to move to hike interest rates regardless.
*****
&gt; “This is the Fed saying we’re at full employment. There is still a gap, but the wage surge was much more than anyone expected and heavily concentrated in low-wage jobs,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “We’re about 3.5 million shy of the previous peak, and the labor market is behaving as if we’re beyond full employment.”
*****
&gt; Inflation will stay front and center with the CPI and PPI reports. Economists expect another hot month for both readings, though some economists believe inflation is close to its peak. November’s headline CPI of 6.8% was the highest since 1982.
*****
&gt; Stock investors will also continue to watch yields. Tech and growth stocks are the most sensitive to rising rates because investors pay for the promise of future earnings. Higher rates mean the cost of money increases and that changes the calculus on their investments.
*****
&gt; Grohowski expects the 10-year yield to reach 2.25% by the end of the year, though it has been moving faster than expected. “Getting there sooner causes more pain ... in those longer duration equity sectors, like tech and the Nasdaq,” he said. “I do think that yields settle down and that tech comes back. I think we’re going to see really good earnings this year. Tech continues to be a beneficiary.”
*****
&gt; Grohowski said the market could see a 10% decline in 2022, but he doubts that slump will happen in the near term because there is so much cash waiting to come into the market.
*****
&gt; “I think this dry powder will be put to work. I think we’re off to a kind of rough start and a reset,” he said. “I think ultimately this reset of expectations is going to be a healthy one. I do think market participants are getting a very early in the year wake-up call after the high returns and low volatility of last year and a doubling of the market in three years. [But] it’s going to be much rougher sledding in the next 12 to 18 months.”
*****
&gt; There are also three big Treasury auctions in the coming week, with the $52 billion 3-year note auction Tuesday, $36 billion in 10-year bonds Wednesday, and $22 billion in 30-year bonds Thursday.
*****
&gt; The 10-year popped as high as 1.80% Friday, but could easily return to that level in the coming week. That puts it just above the 2021 high.
*****
&gt; “In and around those levels, the market will try to find some short term support,” said Greg Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities. He added that the auction could be an event that helps cap the yield move for now.

&gt; # Yale Hirsch’s Santa Claus Rally &amp; January Barometer, Trifecta 2 out of 3 Ain’t Bad

&gt; My father Yale Hirsch invented both of these well-known seasonal indicators in 1972 and published them in the 1973 Stock Trader’s Almanacas you can see in the picture above on pages 11 and 111. He passed away late last year at the ripe old age of 98. Not only was he the illustrious founder of the Stock Trader’s Almanac, but he left me and everybody on the planet a rich legacy of seasonal patterns, strategies and indicators. Many of which he discovered, invented or devised. He also brought others to light with clarity and always full credit of course. And most importantly, from the first Almanacin 1968 Yale taught us all how to think differently about the markets and recurring market patterns. Thanks to him we have a plethora of tools in our analytical and statistical arsenal.

&gt; To quote the great Sir Isaac Newton, “If I have seen further, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.” We proudly stood on Yale’s giant shoulders when we created our “January Indicator Trifecta” back in January 2013. Which brings us to the present.

&gt; Combining our three January indicators, the Santa Claus Rally (SCR), First Five Days (FFD) and January Barometer (JB), into the “January Trifecta” has proven to be an especially reliable gauge for future market performance. When all three are positive, as was the case in 2019, the next eleven months have been up 87.1% of the time with an average gain of 12.3% and the full year advanced 90.3% of the time with an average S&amp;P 500 gain of 17.5%. The worst full-year decline in a year with a positive January Trifecta was 13.1% by S&amp;P 500 in 1966.

&gt; With less than two hours left in the First Five Days, S&amp;P 500 will need to gain more than 70.13 points (1.49%) by the close to keep the bullish January Indicator Trifecta alive in 2022. Since the odds of that happening are slim at this juncture that leaves three possible scenarios for our “January Indicator Trifecta:” SCR up and both FFD and JB down (8 occurrences since 1950 with last 11 months up 2/down 6, average -5.8%, full year up 1/down 7 average -9.4%); SCR up, FFD up and JB down (12 occurrences since 1950 with last 11 months up 10/down 2, average 9.9%, full year up 9/down 3 average 6.0%); or SCR up, FFD down and JB up (6 occurrences since 1950 with last 11 months up 5/down 1, average 9.7%, full year up 5/down 1 average 11.8%). So, two out of three ain’t bad. (See the tables below.)

&gt; Wednesday’s market decline was triggered by a much more hawkish Fed perception following the release of last month’s FOMC Meeting minutes. A more aggressive removal of Fed liquidity could aid in pulling back inflation and it could pressure stocks as bond yields rise. We will withhold final judgement until the final results of the January Barometer arrive. Our base case scenario from our 2022 Annual Forecast is still our pick at this juncture.

&gt; As the opening of the New Year, January is host to many important events, indicators and recurring market patterns. U.S. Presidents are inaugurated and usually present State of the Union Addresses. New Congresses convene. Financial analysts release annual forecasts. Residents of earth return to work and school en masse after holiday celebrations. On January’s second trading day, the results of the official Santa Claus Rally are known and on the fifth trading day the First Five Days “Early Warning” system sounds off, but it is the whole-month gain or loss of the S&amp;P 500 that triggers our January Barometer.

&gt; As defined in the Stock Trader’s Almanac, the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) is the propensity for the S&amp;P 500 to rally the last five trading days of December and the first two of January an average of 1.3% since 1950. The lack of a rally can be a preliminary indicator of tough times to come. This was certainly the case in 2008 and 2000. A 4.0% decline in 2000 foreshadowed the bursting of the tech bubble and a 2.5% loss in 2008 preceded the second worst bear market in history.

&gt; The January Barometer (JB) has registered 12 major errors since 1950 for an 83.3% accuracy ratio. Including the eight flat years yields a .722 batting average. Over the years there has been much debate regarding the efficacy of our January Barometer.

&gt; # January Almanac: Typical January Weaker Last 21 Years

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/0db7be701e8b12ea99121a7d8ee4058c/472f14a607c3f433-51/s500x750/3f1ad549d35e5c06e7ff3855881152a43e468520.jpg))**

&gt; January has quite a reputation on Wall Street as an influx of cash from yearend bonuses and annual allocations has historically propelled stocks higher. January ranks #1 for NASDAQ (since 1971), but fifth on the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA since 1950. January is the last month of the best three-month span and holds a full docket of indicators and seasonalities.

&gt; DJIA and S&amp;P rankings did slip from 2000 to 2016 as both indices suffered losses in ten of those seventeen Januarys with three in a row, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and then again in 2014 to 2016. January 2009 has the dubious honor of being the worst January on record for DJIA (-8.8%) and S&amp;P 500 (-8.6%) since 1901 and 1931 respectively. The early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic spoiled January in 2020 &amp; 2021 as DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all suffered declines in 2020. In 2021, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 declined.

&gt; As you can see in the chart above of the Typical January Performance over the last 21 years diverging market performance across the major indexes like we saw today is not unusual behavior during January in recent years. Since 2001, the S&amp;P 500, DJIA, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have all declined eleven times in twenty-one years in January. DJIA and S&amp;P have posted minor average losses while R1K and R2K have posted fractional gains.

&gt; Over the last 21 years, only NASDAQ has posted a full-month average gain of 1.0% up 12 of 21. All started January positive, only to surrender early-month gains by the end of the month. Weakness has historically accelerated just after mid-month, around the eleventh trading day.

&gt; In midterm years, January ranks near the bottom since 1950. Large-caps have been the worst with S&amp;P 500 ranking #10 (third worst) with DJIA and Russell 1000 ranking #9. Technology and small-cap shares fare slightly better in the rankings, but small-cap average performance is still negative and NASDAQ is only barely positive.

&gt; On pages 112 and 114 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2022 we illustrate that the January Effect, where small caps begin to outperform large caps, actually tends to start in mid-December. Early signs of the January Effect can be seen when comparing iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) to SPDR S&amp;P 500 (SPY) since around December 15. Historically, the majority of small-cap outperformance is normally done by mid-February, but strength can last until mid-May when indices typically reach a seasonal high.

&gt; # ARK Innovation (ARKK) Now Underperforming QQQ Since the Pre-COVID Peak

&gt; After further declines to start 2022, the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) is now up just 47.3% since the pre-COVID peak for the US equity market on 2/19/20 and is now only beating the S&amp;P 500 by 6.66 percentage points since the pre-COVID high. Not only that, but it's also underperforming the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) by 17.9 percentage points.

&gt; ARKK was the envy of the industry in the year or so after the pandemic hit. Fund assets for the ARKK ETF went from $2.4 billion prior to COVID up to $28.5 billion at its peak last February. At its high, ARKK was absolutely crushing both SPY and QQQ. On 2/12/21, ARKK was outperforming SPY by 143 percentage points since the 2/19/20 pre-COVID peak for the stock market and beating the more tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 by 117 percentage points. Since its peak, ARKK has dropped more than 43%, allowing the more steady SPY and QQQ to catch up. Talk about a real-life ""tortoise and the hare"" scenario!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/01/arkkqqqspread.png))**

&gt; Interestingly, if we look at ARKK's annualized price change from its launch in October 2014 through the pre-COVID peak for the stock market on 2/19/20, it's roughly the same as ARKK's annualized price change since the 2/19/20 pre-COVID peak: ~22.8%. Also, throughout its history, ARKK's annualized total return still stands at ~24.3%, which is nearly 10 percentage points better than SPY's annualized total return of 14.8% over the same time frame.

&gt; # IPO Death Cross

&gt; The past two years have seen an explosion in new equity issuance in terms of the number of deals, and especially in terms of the dollar value of those deals. According to Bloomberg data, US average monthly issuance has been $23.83 billion over the past year. That is well above any point in the past few decades including the late 1990s. The actual number of stocks hitting the market has also set records this year, surpassing the 1990s peak.

&gt; While there has been a huge slug of new issuance, the performance of these names have been lackluster. The Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO) does not necessarily track every new name to hit the market, but it does act as a reasonably good proxy for the space. IPO reached an all-time high early in the year in February, but since then it has generally been rangebound fluctuating around its moving averages. Since the fall, and particularly in the past month and a half, the ETF has taken a significant leg lower. IPO has now fallen over 18% since the October 25th closing high, taking out its moving averages in the process. Today, IPO is setting up for what is typically viewed as a negative technical pattern: the death cross (when a downward sloping 50-DMA falls below a downward sloping 200-DMA).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/122921-IPO-1.png))**

&gt; IPO does not have an extremely extensive history only going back to October 2013, and as such, there is only a small handful of prior examples of other death crosses without another instance in the prior three months. In the table below, we show those past instances. Albeit there is a small sample size, contrary to the name and pattern's reputation, prior death crosses have generally been followed by decent performance going forward.

&gt; # Santa Came To Town And 5 More Charts To Watch

&gt; Here is one chart about Santa and five more charts (or tables) that caught our attention recently.

&gt; Well, stocks did what they were supposed to do, which was gain during the historically bullish Santa Claus Rally (last 5 days of the year and first 2 days of the following year). We discussed this seasonally bullish period here, but the bottom line is we expected these days to be strong. It is when Santa doesn’t come to town that makes us worry. In fact, three of the past four times he didn’t come (2000, 2008, and 2015) saw stocks fall for the full year and the last five times he didn’t show all saw January lower. Only 2016 avoided a drop for the full year when Santa didn’t show, but that year started off with one of the worst first six weeks ever, so Santa was still a warning sign.

&gt; Mark this off as one less thing to worry about in 2022.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/blog-1.5.22-1-.png))**

&gt; Just because stocks were up big last year by itself isn’t a reason to worry. “The truth is big yearly gains likely take place in larger bull markets, so don’t get a fear of heights just because of what happened in 2021,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, the past seven times the S&amp;P 500 gained more than 25% saw the next year higher, with five of those years up double digits.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the day, the S&amp;P 500 is up nearly 12% on average and higher 86% of the time after it is up 25% the year before. There are lots of worries out there, but ‘stocks being up a lot and that is why I’m bearish’ shouldn’t be one of them.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blog-1.5.22-2-.png))**

&gt; The first day of 2022 started off with a rare all-time high on Day 1. We were surprised, as this has only happened five other times in history. Let’s be clear, we would never suggest investing based on one day, but years that make a new high on the first day actually see a strong January and strong full year return. Not to mention nearly 40 all-time highs on average along the way.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/blog-1.5.22-3-.png))**

&gt; Taking this a step further, stocks not only made new highs, but it was a strong Day 1 as well. Below you will see that previous times the first day of the year gained more than 0.6% saw stronger than average January and full year returns. Again, don’t blindly invest on only this one signal, but it is quite interesting.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/blog-1.5.22-4-.png))**

&gt; The fourth quarter of 2021 went out like a champ, gaining more than 10% in the process. Turns out, 10% gains likely mean continued strength. Incredibly, the S&amp;P 500 was higher two quarters later the past 12 times the S&amp;P 500 gained more than 10% in a quarter. Again, this is just one study, but it does little to change the view that the bull market is likely alive and well in 2022.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/blog-1.5.22-5-.png))**

&gt; Another eye-opening stat is the S&amp;P 500 is up 7 consecutive quarters, one of the longest quarterly win streaks ever. Turns out that future strength is more common than you might think. Two quarters later the S&amp;P 500 has never been lower and a year later up a very solid 14.1% on average. In fact, you have to go back to the early 1950s for the last time a quarterly win streak ended at 7, as they usually manage to go further than most think.

I wanted your thoughts on large banks/financials for the next 6-12 months+

I know financials have already moved up, but it feels like there is some more room to run until the Fed actually moves up rates and finishes taper. 

When rates moved up from 2004-2006 and 2016-2017, large banks did well. But stock markets were also strong, so it is hard to tell. 

I am not looking at smaller banks or regionals for this, trying to focus on larger banks such as BAC, JPM, C, WFC. 

Logically banks have more money to make on loans if rates are higher, but I assume their volume will be lower in terms of lending, especially if housing market slows down

Just want some thoughts or any good data if possible

Usually not a stock picker, but trying to do some DD to see if there are any opportunities

2021-12-20 21:13:39,r/stocks,The market hit a bottom,"I'm pretty sure I said this last week, and today has tested it but not by much. I'm still calling us near a local bottom - not because of an expectation of January Effect, or the tax loss harvesting to go away after Decem-bear, etc.

In the below image I track unique patterns I call ""hidden-dojis"". A doji is a trading indicator that suggests indecision. Indecision is when Bears and Bulls are pretty evenly matched.

These indecisions mean one of two outcomes has to come true, either more down, or more up. And I do not believe we are facing a technical correction or a bearish market for the short term. Nothing suggests it. Financials are good, macro-economics are good, no one actually gives 2 shjts about Omicron (that's just news fear mongering).

Bottom line is everything is looking good for market outlook, which means the sell-off is a technical one, not a fundamental one. Call it tax loss harvesting, risk reduction, whatever, it's just traders being traders.

I point to the two hidden dojis, the left side is counter trend (up in a down trend) and signifies the indecisiveness of bulls. Then we hit the center drop which was renewed bearish strength.

Then we hit the counter trend hidden doji on the right side, which is down in an uptrend. And I expected to see it since I first identified this trade last week.

Hence last week on the same expectation I said we hit a bottom.

I didn't expect it to be so dramatic (making today near the absolute bottom) but that's OK.

I expected a reverse head and shoulders pattern but we are still queued for a triple bottom pattern which is simply a variant of the head and shoulders.

If we were facing a Bearish change of sentiment what we would look for is a significantly sideways (low volatility) week before Christmas, or a new lower low by Christmas or next week.

If that happens, then I think we are pretty much confirmed to be in a correction territory.

But, if tomorrow is strong. I think that'll crush the shorts and the week will finish strong or OK, and January will kick off with a bang.

And that's the bet I'm leaning toward based on the technicals below.

I use GS as a proxy, the pattern exists in SPY as well but is less ""clean"".

GS, JPM and the banks look very clean as in the image below.

* Apple

* RH
* UAA

&gt;The bank is recommending cyclical quality stocks from its high-quality large-cap portfolio, which should help investors capture some upside and outperform to the downside. Each stock has an overweight rating by Wells Fargo analysts, a market cap of more than $3 billion, and “favorable” quality, which is based on debt to EBITDA (or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), profit margins and return on equity.

&gt; “We believe it is time to move up in quality and down in risk,” Harvey said. “The Fed has turned hawkish; we are seeing pricing fatigue; growth is decelerating; market froth is abundant; and risk-averse options are relatively cheap but limited... so expect pressure on multiples.”


....

&gt;Harvey noted that much of consumers’ pent-up demand has been satisfied and retailers might have a harder time hiking prices going forward.

&gt; “We are not worried about the overall health of the U.S. consumer,” Harvey said. “Our focus is more the marginal change as it relates to future spending, since we are beginning to suspect the consumer is no longer the price-taker it was six to 12 months ago.”

So most of this list is pretty standard. Although I'm not very familiar with the cases for RH and UAA. Why doesn't Wells see dampening consumer demand for these products?

2021-12-17 23:08:57,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, December 17, 2021"," 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, December 17, 2021**

Stocks extended Thursday’s losses, with the market ending a volatile week in the red as market participants continued to digest ongoing risk surrounding the Omicron variant and the Fed’s new monetary policy, which signaled a faster rate of taper and interest rate hikes next year. 

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -1.02%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -0.50%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -1.42%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +0.92% 
* Volatility Index: +3.19%
* JP Morgan (JPM): -2.28%
* Oracle (ORCL): -6.39%
* AMC: +19.22%
* FedEx (FDX): 4.95%
* Rivian (RIVN): -10.26%

The main focus of market participants remains on the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy decision, with the Central Bank doubling the pace of tapering and suggestions that the interest rate may be raised three times in 2022.

The potential for higher rates continues to weigh heavily on technology and growth stocks whose valuations rely heavily on future earnings potential. In the last month, the Nasdaq has fallen by -3.43% and the Russell 2000, which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 8.32% in the last month.

On the other hand, cyclical stocks in the energy and financials sectors outperformed on Thursday, with the prospects of higher interest rates and stronger growth seen as benefiting these sectors. The Dow Jones (DIA) has only lost -1.23% in the month and has been trending upwards in December. As always, it’s important to balance a portfolio with both growth and value stocks.

Troy Gayeski, Chief Market Strategist at F5 Investments, said “The thing investors have to understand is, we're going through a major transition in monetary policy. The Fed has been running emergency policies arguably far longer than they should have been, and as that money supply growth slows down as they ease off the balance sheet expansion and ultimately hike next year, one would at least expect more volatility in markets. And that's really what we've been seeing the last month."" 

**Highlights** 

* The Biden administration on Friday recommended the Federal Communications Commission grant Alphabet's Google and Facebook-parent Meta licenses for an undersea cable.
* The companies entered into national security agreements to protect data on the Pacific Light Cable Network system, an undersea fiber optic cable system that will connect the United States, Taiwan and the Philippines.
* Tesla Inc was hit by a lawsuit over CEO Elon Musk's social media posts including his Twitter poll on stock sales that pulled down its stock prices. Investor David Wagner called for access to internal documents to investigate whether Tesla and Musk failed to adhere to fiduciary duties
* Rivian stock gapped down another roughly 11%  after the company reported earnings that showed steep losses and said it expects to fall “a few hundred vehicles short of its 1,200 production target for this year.
* Alibaba Deputy CFO Toby Xu, making his first major public remarks since being named this month to take over as CFO, said that international e-commerce ""will become one of the key growth drivers"", adding that 57% of revenue for Cainiao, Alibaba's logistics unit, comes from overseas.
* Reddit announced it was filing for an IPO with an estimated $15 billion valuation. I love the platform but I think they’ll have a hard time monetizing users.
* Rivian also announced it was planning to build a new factory in Georgia in order to boost production
* Kellogg’s has reached a new tentative agreement with its 1,400 striking cereal plant workers that could bring an end to the strike that began Oct. 5.",51,12,psychotrader00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ris5lh/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_friday_december/,ris5lh

*****
&gt; This week’s gains have put the major averages back within striking distance of their record highs. The Dow is 2.3% from its record and the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are 1.2% and 3.2% from their all-time highs, respectively.

Well today my proof couldn’t be more blatantly obvious. We have massive selloffs in lots of growth sectors with funds profit taking. And surprise, surprise… those profits are flowing right into tickers like JPM, GS, WFC, and BAC. These funds are rebalancing from the end of an amazing growth cycle. They’re being smart and taking profits while they can. If you’re salty about this then you’re probably stuck holding the bag.

And no, it’s not too late to to do the same for your portfolio. Banks will make more money as interest rates increase. Truly a no brainer move. The stock prices will still go higher from here. They’ve been consolidating at these levels for quite some time now as we’ve waited for direction from our government and JPOW.

# [Stock futures are flat as investors evaluate big retail earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/15/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained after better-than-expected results from Walmart and Home Depot.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow, which contains the two big retailers, added 70 points, or 0.19%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures were slightly in the red.
*****
&gt; Walmart kicked off a busy week of retail earnings by saying third-quarter profit and revenue was well above estimates with U.S. same-store sales jumping 9.2%, excluding fuel. The company also raised its forecast for 2021, saying adjusted earnings per share will be around $6.40 versus its prior expectations of between $6.20 and $6.35. The shares moved slighly lower in premarket trading.
*****
&gt; Home Depot gained more than 1%, however, after its third-quarter earnings beat estimates on a 9.8% sales burst.
*****
&gt; Retail sales figures for October came in 1.7% higher than 0.7% in September, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expected sales to have jumped by 1.5%.
*****
&gt; Industrial production numbers will also be released Tuesday, as well as the NAHB housing market index survey.
*****
&gt; During regular trading Monday, the Dow dipped about 13 points, or 0.04%, for its fourth negative session in the last five. At the high of the day the 30-stock index gained about 136 points. The S&amp;P 500 finished the day unchanged at 4,682.87. The benchmark index moved between gains and losses during the session, at one point gaining 0.3%, while also trading 0.21% lower. The Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.04%. The Russell 2000 was the relative underperformer, declining 0.45%.
*****
&gt; Stocks’ move came as interest rates rose, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note topping 1.62% while the 30-bear Treasury bond rose above 2%.
*****
&gt; Inflation fears are weighing on the market after last month’s consumer price index posted its largest annual increase in more than three decades. Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he believes inflation will moderate in 2022, but that “the path to lower inflation [will] begin with higher inflation in the front half of the year.”
*****
&gt; “The stickier drivers of inflation are likely to persist, but our base case is that they will not outweigh the improvement we expect in the transitory elements,” he wrote in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; On Monday afternoon President Joe Biden signed the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill into law. The package includes funding for transportation, broadband and utilities.
*****
&gt; The major averages are coming off their first negative week in six, but stocks are still trading around all-time high levels. As Wall Street strategists look to 2022 some, including Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson, believe the picture looks muted.
*****
&gt; “With financial conditions tightening and earnings growth slowing, the 12-month risk/reward for the broad indices looks unattractive at current prices,” he said Monday in a note to clients. “However, strong nominal GDP growth should continue to provide plenty of good investment opportunities at the stock level for active managers,” he added. His 12-month base target for the S&amp;P 500 is 4,400, which is 6% below where the index closed on Monday.

All these tickers are primed to go higher from these consolidated price points as interest rates rise and we taper sooner than the FED thought we would. The loan growth and capital markets are projected to keep flying all through next year. 

As we can see by the slaughter going on in the growth space, it actually IS important to have a healthy balance sheet and be profitable. Otherwise once your growth slows and you’re still unprofitable, you’re gonna sink.

For those of you that are looking to park money in a safe place on a steady rise while collecting a dividend, this is a good bet, very low risk and moderately high rewards as a long play.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 1, 2021**

The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) continued their remarkable rally to once again reach new intraday record highs, with equities carrying on momentum from a record-setting October. Market participants continue to be encouraged by the stronger-than-expected start of the Q3 corporate earnings season, with companies posting robust results despite ongoing supply-side disruptions and labor market imbalances. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for the Fed’s monthly meeting minutes, set to be released later this week, where I expect the Fed to officially start the tapering process, and the October jobs report, which is expected to show a pick-up in hiring after two disappointing months in a row.

According to a report by LPL Financial, November has been the best month for equities since 1950.

Though some of the heavily weighted index components from last week had disappointed against consensus estimates — with both Amazon and Apple shares dropping after posting weaker-than-expected results and guidance — other stronger results helped offset these misses, with names including Alphabet and Microsoft rallying to record levels on the heels of their respective reports. 

On Tuesday and Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will meet for its monthly policy-setting meeting, which is followed by a statement and press conference by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. This meeting is expected to either announce or concretely set the stage to being tapering the pace of quantitative easing which has been running at a clip of $120 billion per month. Last month, the Fed announced that amid improving economic data, the process would begin before the end of the year and would come to an end around mid-2022. 

Given the market has been anticipating the start to tapering for months now, speculation around when the Fed will make a move on interest rates has become a point of particular interest to investors. This week's FOMC statement and press conference are likely to provide some more color to market participants around how committee members are thinking about the timing for interest-rate hikes, especially given the persistent jump in inflation seen in data including last week's core personal consumption expenditures report.

**Highlights**

* Tesla (TSLA) continued its psycho-rally to reach a new all time high and making CEO Elon Musk the first person ever to surpass a $300 billion personal net worth. Absolutely insane.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 25, 2021**

The market continued its remarkable rally, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) recording a new intraday high for the second consecutive day, as market participants continue to digest third-quarter corporate earnings, which have so far largely come in better than expected. This week will be a massive one for earnings, with tech mega-caps Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG), among many other very important companies, reporting earnings.

Last Friday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed that the Fed is “on track: to begin slowing the pace of quantitative easing, signaling that the US economy has recovered enough to sustain reduced Fed stimulus starting as soon as next month. I have been saying for months that I expected tapering to begin either November or December or this year. He said, “I do think it’s time to taper, and I don’t think it’s time to raise rates.” This is music to my ears, I have also been saying for months that I remain bullish until the Fed begins discussing the possibility of raising interest rates.

In the September meeting minutes, the Fed noted that “Participants generally assessed that, provided that the economic recovery remained broadly on track, a gradual tapering process that concluded around the middle of next year would likely be appropriate. 

Market participants are encouraged that despite persistent supply-side disruptions, which have only intensified as the holiday season kicks off, and labor market imbalances stemming from the pandemic. Participants noted that if a decision to begin tapering purchases occurred at the next meeting, the process of tapering could commence with the monthly purchase calendars beginning in either mid-November or mid-December.""

As of Friday, about 23% of S&amp;P 500 companies had reported actual results for the third quarter, and of these, 84% topped Wall Street's expectations for earnings per share (EPS), according to data from FactSet. The estimated earnings growth rate for the S&amp;P 500 was 32.7%, based on actual results and expectations for companies still yet to report as of last week. If maintained through the end of Q3 earnings season, that would mark the third-highest earnings growth rate posted for the index since 2010.

Been thinking about treat myself something nice after my first paycheck, but heard about all the great things of delayed gratification and compound interest. So, I saved every penny I possibly could and invested in stocks. After school started, I continued to work there part-time.

Fast forward to 3 weeks ago, I broke with my girlfriend and went on a shopping spread. Bought a nice PC, pair of sneakers, and some fancy outfit for the fall/winter. I don't really regret the purchases, as impulsive as it may sound, I can actually manage to pay it off in  3 months. But just during my class this morning, my manager texted me and laid me off. Mostly because as the weather gets colder, fewer people will need A/C and fewer things to do in the store. So now my plan is in scrumble.

I have about 7K in stocks, and 3K in credit card debts. 

1st option, borrow from friends and pay them off after I got another job.

2nd option, apply for a balance transfer card, get the debts to 0% APR, and pay the minimum off until I got a job.

3rd option, and my least favorite, sold half of my position, and just get the debts out of the way right now.

# **Earnings are the big catalyst for stocks in the week ahead, as Tesla and Netflix report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/15/earnings-are-the-big-catalyst-for-stocks-in-the-week-ahead-as-tesla-and-netflix-report.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks appear to have shaken off the often spooky trading pattern of October for now, and whether that continues could depend on earnings in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Dozens of companies are reporting, from Netflix and Tesla to Intel, Procter &amp; Gamble and American Express. Railroads, airlines, health care, tech, financial firms, energy and consumer products companies are all reporting in the first big wave of reports.
*****
&gt; Stocks were higher in the past week, with the Nasdaq leading the charge with a 2.2% gain. Cyclical sectors, like materials, industrials and consumer discretionary were outperformers, and tech held its own with a 2.6% gain. Real estate investment trusts were also among the best sectors up nearly 3.5%.
*****
&gt; “Unlike prior earnings seasons that we’ve seen recently, the expectations are a bit more muted heading into this earnings season, as far as analysts’ revisions are concerned,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke. “That tends to lower the bar, which makes the earnings season much more manageable. Volatility is a code word for ‘down.’ Manageable is a code word for ‘up.’ That’s a decent set-up and just the fact that the market has been down heading into the earnings season.”
*****
&gt; Hickey said it’s not clear the strong surge in stocks in the last few sessions is signaling an all-clear for usually negative tone of October.
*****
&gt; “We’ll have a better idea once we get through all these earnings reports coming up next week,” he said. “That’s going to be the big tell. So far the initial reactions haven’t been too bad, especially given all the concerns people have had over the headwinds. Everyone’s been so concerned about the supply chain issues and inflation, and the companies that reported have held up reasonably well.”
*****
&gt; Hickey noted that Nike stock has recouped much of the decline it saw after the company discussed supply issues Sept. 23 in its fiscal first-quarter report.
*****
&gt; Major banks, like Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, have reported quarterly results with solid beats in the past week. The financial sector, which includes insurance and credit-card firms besides banks, is at this point expected to see a profit gain of 30.7%, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Overall the profits of S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to gain 32%, based on estimates and actual third-quarter reports.
*****
&gt; Refinitiv says companies are beating expectations so far by 15.6%, compared to the long-term average of 4%, but below the 18.4% average of the last four quarters. Energy is expected to see the biggest profit gains, a shocking 1,517%, while the utilities sector is forecast to have the lowest gain, just 0.2%.
*****
&gt; “Some smaller groups are knocking the lights out, but it’s not the same thing as if it was uniform,” said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. “Roughly speaking, the cyclical groups are expected to have growth of 96% this quarter and tech is expected to be about 25%... I think the story here is the financial and cyclical parts of the market are really going to surprise, as long as you have disruption. As long as disruption continues, it’s going to benefit certain companies. It may be transitory, but transitory could last a year or two.”
*****
&gt; Golub said it could be a risk for the market if only some groups are earnings winners. “If we can get an aggregate beat of 8% to 10%, but it’s being held up by a smaller part of the market, and the median company is not delivering stronger earnings numbers, it is a negative,” he said. “It’s one of my concerns about the earnings season.”
*****
&gt; Golub said investors have been worried about margins being squeezed because of higher input costs, but he said a bigger concern is that companies are unable to make deliveries because they don’t have products.
*****
&gt; “They got an order. They can’t fulfil it, and they can’t book the sale. That’s the risk here. I think it’s real. Inventories are being adjusted further down, and backlogs are being adjusted further up. Delivery times are getting extended further and further,” Golub said. “That’s the risk.”
*****
&gt; Golub expects the S&amp;P 500 to reach 4,600 by the end of 2021, from its current 4,471 level, and he said he sees nothing to derail that expectation. He expects cyclicals should do better, but technology stocks are likely to be just market performers.
*****
&gt; ″[Tech’s] growth is not impressive on a forward 12-month basis, and it’s disproportionately expensive,” he said. “I think the growth stocks in general and tech stocks more specifically are going to face stiff headwinds from the combination of valuations being really high and their expected sales growth being weaker than the rest of the market. If this was just the current quarter, it would be one thing but it’s not. It’s the next 12 months.”
*****
&gt; “If interest rates and everything lines up for tech, that’s great,” he said. But he said he does not see tech as a leader in the next year. “I think they’ll be market performers, but I think they’ll be winners for the next decade —100%.”
*****
&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield, which particularly influences technology and growth shares, was at 1.57% Friday, after topping 1.60% in the past week.
*****
&gt; Besides earnings, there are a few economic reports to watch, including existing home sales and the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey on Thursday. On Friday, Markit manufacturing and services PMI data is released. The Federal Reserve’s beige book on the economy is issued Wednesday afternoon.
*****
&gt; The first bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund could begin to trade next week, when ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF is expected to debut. The Securities and Exchange Commission could still hold up the ETF if it objects to the filing before midnight Monday, but that is not seen as likely, a source told CNBC.
*****
&gt; Bitcoin rose above $60,000 for the first time in six months Friday, as investors bet the ProShares and other cryptocurrency-based ETFs would begin to trade soon.

&gt; # Double Digit Gain for Bullish Sentiment

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has managed to put in a higher low in the past few days, and investor sentiment is reflecting the recovery in equity prices. The AAII's weekly sentiment survey saw the percentage of respondents reporting as bullish leap 12.4 percentage points to 37.9%. That is only the highest level since September 9th, but it also marked the largest one-week increase in bullish sentiment since last November. The last double-digit increase was just over six months ago during the week of April 8th when it rose 11.1 percentage points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; The recovery in bullish sentiment this week leaves the reading essentially right in line with its historical average, but again it has been a while since bullish sentiment has experienced such a large increase. Going back through the history of the survey, there have been 43 other times in which bullish sentiment has risen at least 10 percentage points in a week without another occurrence in the prior six months. As shown below, those types of moves have typically been positive for short-term performance with the S&amp;P 500 on average outperforming the norm one week, one month, and three months out. With that said, returns six and twelve months later have tended to see slightly weaker than normal returns.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-AAII-Bull-Jumps.png))**

&gt; With a big increase in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment pulled back to 31.8%. That is the lowest level since the first week of September, and similar to bullish sentiment, it is not far off from the historical average. In other words, the size of the move was large but the level of sentiment is pretty unremarkable.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; The inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the spread between the two to move back in favor of bulls for the first time in a month. The one-week increase in the spread also tied the week of February 11th for the largest jump since last November.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

&gt; Bullish sentiment appears to have borrowed more heavily from those formerly reporting as neutral. Whereas bearish sentiment dropped 5 percentage points week over week, neutral sentiment shed 7.4 percentage points. Again, that decline does not mark any notable low and is not far away from the historical average.

&gt; # Two Big Banks Break Two Long Streaks

&gt; Earlier on Thursday, we noted how shares of JP Morgan Chase (JPM) had traded lower on their earnings reaction days for five straight quarters. Despite the string of weak short-term reactions to earnings, though, JPM has performed very well in the period encompassing this streak rallying more than 66% since the start of September 2020. While JPM's streak of five straight negative reactions to earnings reports was impressive enough, two other big banks that reported on Thursday were riding even longer streaks of negative reactions to earnings. Heading into Thursday's report, Bank of America (BAC) had traded lower in reaction to earnings for seven straight quarters while Citigroup (C) traded down for six straight quarters. In both cases, Thursday's positive price reactions to their respective reports ended those streaks.

&gt; Like JPM, while both stocks have experienced very negative short-term reactions to their earnings reports, during the entire run of declines on their earnings reaction days, they have both rallied sharply. In the case of BAC, the stock has rallied 33% since the start of 2020 when its earnings losing streak began, while shares of C are up 95% since the start of April when its six-quarter streak began. In the case of Citi, in fact, it has actually outperformed the S&amp;P 500 which is up 75% in that same span. As noted with JPM, the performance of these two stocks also suggests that a stock's short-term reaction to earnings isn't necessarily a good indicator of its longer-term outlook.

&gt; # US Outperforms the Rest of the World... Again

&gt; In January of this year, we looked at the relative performance of the United States versus the rest of the world (ROW). At the time, ROW was making up lost ground relative to the US, but that didn't last long. Through the first three quarters of 2021, the US (SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF-SPY) picked up steam once again and has significantly outpaced both the rest of the world (Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF- VEU) and emerging markets (iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF- EEM). Emerging markets have been the underperformers of the group while the US has led. Although EEM outperformed at the beginning of 2021, the index has since moved lower while the US trudged higher right up through early September. YTD through the end of Q3, SPY has outperformed EEM by 19.5 percentage points, which ranks as the second-widest spread between the two ETFs since EEM started trading in 2004. While not to the same degree, the US has also notably outperformed the rest of the world as well with a performance gap of 12.4 percentage points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/SPY-vs-int-etf-perf-101121.png))**

&gt; Over the last 17 years, Q4 performance has been mixed after the performance spread between SPY and EEM during the first three quarters of the year was in the double digits. Since 2004, there have been five prior occurrences, and in three of those years, SPY continued to outperform in Q4 while it lagged twice. Over the last decade, EEM has only outperformed SPY two times through the end of Q3 (2016 and 2017), and this year is the fourth in a row where SPY outperformed EEM.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101121-spy-eem.png))**

&gt; Similar to EEM, SPY has also steadily outperformed VEU in the first three quarters of the year with outperformance in 11 of the last 14 years. Interestingly, in the three years where SPY lagged VEU, it outperformed in Q4 all three times. Like this year, SPY outperformed VEU by double-digit percentages in the first three quarters of the year only three other times since 2008. The last two times there was a positive double-digit spread (2018 and 2020), VEU outperformed for the remainder of the year.

&gt; Investors often look to play trends in the first three quarters of the year for a continuation through Q4 or a reversion to the mean. However, in terms of big performance gaps between US stocks and both international and emerging markets in the first three quarters of the year, like the analysis we highlighted last week with sectors, historically there's been no discernible trend of either a continuation or reversal of that trend in Q4.

&gt; # Airline Passenger Traffic Back on the Ascent After a Weird August

&gt; After a surge in the first half of the year and into Summer which took the number of daily air passengers back to levels last seen before the pandemic, Americans started to pull back in their air travel from late July through early September. Much of this decline was likely seasonal in nature, but the rise of the COVID Delta variant likely played a role too, at least at the margin. After peaking out just shy of 2.1 million passengers per day, the average daily volume of travelers in the nation's airports fell by nearly 25% through mid-September. Since that low a month ago, though, volumes have been on the rise, and average daily air passenger traffic over the last seven days is now only down 10% from its July high.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-TSA-Throughput.png))**

&gt; As air passenger traffic has picked up, it's not surprising that the airline stocks have bounced a bit off their lows in August. The ETF which tracks the major airlines in the sector (JETs) has rallied more than 10% from its August low. It was also up as much as 18% earlier this month before crude oil prices topping $80 started to weigh on sentiment in the sector.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-JETS.png))**

&gt; In looking at air travel trends on a monthly basis, one thing that stands out is just how strange of a month August was. The chart below shows the percentage of days by month that passenger traffic was up relative to its reading in the prior week. Back in March 2020 when air passenger traffic ground to a halt, every day saw week/week declines in passenger traffic. Coming off of a low base, these readings picked up in May and June as the panic started to subside, and throughout 2021, we continued to see steady levels of week/week increases in air passenger traffic. In five of the first seven months of 2021, at least half of all days saw air passenger traffic levels above their week-ago levels, and the two that didn't (January and April) still had more than a third of all days show increases.

&gt; But then came August. Throughout the entire month of August, there was only one day (8/1) where passenger traffic was up week/week and from there the next 30 days were all lower. Granted, traffic levels were coming off of post-pandemic highs, but the fact that traffic levels were so steady to the downside implies that Americans just didn't want to fly. While most people were sad to see the summer come to an end, thankfully for the country's airlines, traffic picked up again in September, and October is now on pace to be the second straight month where passenger traffic levels have increased on a week/week basis on at least two-thirds of days.

&gt; # Claims Sub-300K

&gt; Initial jobless claims have continued to decline with this week's reading falling to 293K from an upwardly revised reading of 329K last week. The 36K week/week decline was not only more than double the expected decline, but it was also the largest since a 48K drop at the end of June. Additionally, after this week's decline, the seasonally adjusted number is now at the lowest level of the pandemic, only 37K above the levels from March 14, 2020. After revisions to prior weeks, this week also marks the first sub-300K reading since the pandemic began.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; While seasonally adjusted claims were lower, unadjusted claims rose to 277K from 261K. A rise in regular state claims is very much the norm for the current week of the year with said week having historically observed claims rise WoW over three-quarters of the time going back to 1967. Before seasonal adjustments, claims have likely put in their seasonal low and will continue to trend higher into the end of the year. Additionally, with the end of enhanced benefit programs in early September, PUA claims have continued to drop off coming in at 21.62K this week. While at a nearly negligible level, that is still a few thousand off the low of 14.79K from the week of September 17th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-Initial-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png))**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-Initial-Jobless-Claims-NSA-Season.png))**

&gt; Continuing claims after seasonal adjustment likewise reached a new low of 2.593 million. This week's 134K decline was the third week/week drop in a row and the largest of those weeks. That leaves claims 809K above the levels from right before the pandemic.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-Cont-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; Tacking on all programs for continuing claims gives a more complete picture with the most recent data through the week of September 24th. Total claims across all programs totaled 3.66 million that week. Since the end of the support of pandemic era programs, total claims have now fallen by 7.6 million. Essentially the entirety of that decline is thanks to the massive drops in PUA, PEUC, and Extended Benefits programs as support has come to an end. In fact, since the first week of September (the last week before the expiration of enhanced benefits) regular state claims are actually higher by 26.4K whereas PUA, PEUC, and Extended Benefits programs have together fallen 7.616 million. Outside of regular state programs, PUA claims still account for the largest share of total claims with 549.1K claims followed by PEUC (440.4K), and the Extended Benefits (222.6K). With regards to Extended Benefits, throughout the summer we noted the volatile swings in that program. The teeter-tottering has appeared to have stopped for the time being as the program has now seen back-to-back significant declines from the 9/10 high of 431.3K. In other words, any oddities in that program's data (potentially as a result of claimants switching from PUA or PEUC claims as their expiration ended) appear to be finally working themselves out.

2021-10-15 23:15:21,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, October 15, 2021"," 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 15, 2021**

*Sorry for not posting the recap yesterday, with the market bouncing so hard decide to take a day off and treat myself!*

Stocks rose on Friday, continuing a monster bounce in October that has seen the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) claw back a lot of the losses suffered in September, and finish the week 2% higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ), which fell as much as 8% from its previous peak, closed the week a remarkable 2.65% higher while the Dow Jones (DIA) closed the week 1.49% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed the week 1.43% higher. Market participants are encouraged by an unexpected rise in retail sales in the US and a stronger-than-expected start to earnings season, which kicked off this week with big banks reporting. 

Not to toot my own horn, but as I have continuously said, I continue to see any dips in the markets as buying opportunities, including this latest dip. While I understood and have written extensively about the current risk factors in the market (China, inflation, supply-chain issues, etc), these are all issues that have been known about and have been affecting the market for months. Just because we see a sudden uptick in “doomsaying” headlines from mass media, doesn’t mean the fundamentals of the bull market in US equities have shifted (remember they are paid for you to engage with the content). Until something fundamentally changes (like inflation forcing the Fed to suddenly hike the interest rate), I continue to stick to my plan. Just be sure to be prepared for any eventuality, I do this by having zero margin in my long-term account and adhering to stop losses in trades.

The Department of Commerce released their monthly report on retail sales, which showed an unexpected rise in consumer spending in September despite supply-chain constraints. Retail sales for the month increased by 0.7%, against the Dow Jones estimate for a decline of 0.2%. Compared with a year ago, sales were up 13.9%. Still despite robust consumer spending, economists warn that supply bottlenecks will increase heading into the holiday season, as demand increases. Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets said,  “The solid retail sales report reflects both consumer resilience and escalating prices. The main concern now is that supply-chain disruption and micro-chip shortages appear to be spreading, limiting selection and tamping down goods demand.” 

This week's early batch of stronger-than-anticipated quarterly results has helped assuage investors' concerns over a sharp deceleration in corporate profits, especially as expenses mount for companies across industries in the face of higher input and labor costs. 

So far, Wall Street analysts are looking for third-quarter earnings growth of about 27% on a year-over-year basis, [according to FactSet data. ](https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_100821.pdf)Though this would still be the third-fastest earnings growth rate since 2010, it would be a marked slowdown from the second quarter's nearly 90% pace. 

**Highlights**

* Big US banks kicked off earnings season with a bang, with XLF, the ETF tracking all banks in the SP 500, jumping to record levels. 
* In a statement, Amazon-owned streaming platform Twitch confirmed that last week’s data breach contained the company’s source code, but insisted that passwords, credit card info, and other sensitive info was not compromised.
* Shares of Disney (DIS) spiked after unconfirmed reports that the company planned to spin off its ESPN operations. Reports later come out to discredit the original report so it remains unclear if anything is actually happening.
* Chinese EV company NIO reportedly plans to increase production capacity by 20% at their main factory and aim for another 100% rise by mid-2022. Shares of the company are up 4% on the news.
* Microsoft (MSFT) is shutting down operations of business social media LinkedIn in China following increased regulatory scrutiny, but the company still has other operations within the country
* Disney (DIS) has unveiled a line-up of more than 20 new content titles from the Asia-Pacific region, including 18 original productions, that will be streamed over its Disney+ service. This is likely in response to the unprecedented success of Netflix’s (NFLX) Squid Game, which rapidly became the company’s most viewed showed ever.
* Twitter (TWTR) said it was rolling out new ad features and revamping the algorithm that decides which ads as the company deepens its push for monetization and launch new eCommerce features.

***Hey Psychos!! Today's recap is a bit longer than usual because there was a lot of really important information released. I urge you to read until the end, especially the part regarding the CPI.***

Stocks finished mostly even, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) leading the day as market participants digested the start of earnings season, the consumer and producer price indexes, which showed an acceleration in inflation, and the Federal Reserve’s September meeting minutes, which are basically notes of what was discussed in the meeting. 

While supply-side disruptions have been going on since the beginning of the pandemic (when the world was essentially forced to shut down overnight), recent developments reflect the extent of these disruptions heading into the holidays, by far the busiest season for retailers. Due to congestions in the ports and sky-high shipping rates, companies like Target (TGT), Costco (COST), and Walmart (WMT) have resorted to chartering their own ships and diverting the usual routes to less congested ports. In a statement, Target recently said “As co-managers of the ship, we can avoid delays from additional stops and steer clear of particularly backed-up ports.”

In addition, President Biden met with leaders from the Port of Los Angeles, the Port of Long Beach, and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union to discuss supply chain issues at the ports. In the end, the parties agreed to expand port operations activities to be 24/7 nationwide. 

The latest batch of economic data due Wednesday confirmed that these supply and demand mismatches translated to ongoing inflationary pressures.  Labor Department's Consumer Price Index, core prices, excluding food and energy, rose by 4.0% in September over last year, coming down only slightly from June's 30-year high of 4.5%. And a broader measure of consumer prices including all categories rose 5.4% in September compared to last year, coming in at the fastest pace since 2008. Please, before you ask why food and energy are excluded from core CPI, read the exact reason by the Federal Reserve below. 

To understand why the categories of food and energy are more sensitive to price changes and thus not useful measures when considering broad inflationary measures, consider environmental factors that can ravage a year’s crops or fluctuations in the oil supply resulting from the OPEC cartel. Each is an example of a supply shock that may affect the prices for that product. However, although the prices of those goods may frequently increase or decrease at rapid rates, the price disturbances may not be related to a trend change in the economy’s overall price level. Instead, changes in food and energy prices often are more likely related to temporary factors that may reverse themselves later. Basically, including food and energy prices economists may be fooled into believing that general prices are rising or falling more rapidly than they really are

Please, I urge you to read the Fed’s exact reasoning as to why Core CPI is taken as the real measure of inflation, I’ve seen a TON of misinformation spreading about this across social media. Core CPI has been calculated the exact same way for decades, I don’t understand why it became so controversial this year. Please read to link below, it is fundamentally necessary for us market participants to understand how this works.

In the latest monthly monetary policy meeting, the Fed signaled it would likely begin reducing the pace of asset-purchasing by $15 billion per month starting in November or December. As a reminder, since early on in the pandemic, the Fed implemented a program of quantitative easing at a clip of $120 billion per month. This is exactly what I said would happen last month, and it seems the market already priced this in. Like I have said multiple times before, I remain bullish until the Fed begins discussing raising the interest rate. 

Q3 earnings season kicked off with JP Morgan (JPM), the largest bank in the US, and BlackRock (BLK), the largest asset management company in the world, reporting earnings. Both smashed earnings estimates. Here are the numbers

**JP Morgan - JPM**

* Revenue of $30.44 billion v $29.8 billion expected
* Earnings per share of $3.74 v $3 expected

**BlackRock - BLK**

* Asset Under Management (AUM): $9.46 trillion v $7.81 trillion last year
* Revenue of $5.1 billion v $4.9 billion expected
* Earnings per share of $10.95 v $9.54

Wall Street analysts are looking for third-quarter earnings growth of about 27% on a year-over-year basis, [according to FactSet data. ](https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_100821.pdf)Though this would still be the third-fastest earnings growth rate since 2010, it would be a marked slowdown from the second quarter's nearly 90% pace.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-wednesday-oct-13.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Wall Street looks to avoid a four-session losing streak

&gt; * U.S. stock futures were essentially flat Wednesday after Dow stock JPMorgan Chase reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue and ahead of key inflation data. Shares of JPMorgan rose modestly in the premarket as third-quarter results from the bank were supported by a $1.5 billion boost from better-than-expected loan losses.

&gt; * The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq all dropped Tuesday for the third straight session. The modest losses indicated that investors were in a wait-and-see mode ahead of earnings season really kicking into high gear.

&gt; * Shares of Delta Air Lines dipped in the premarket after the carrier on Wednesday reported that third-quarter earnings and revenue topped expectations. It was Delta’s first quarterly profit without taking federal aid into account since the start of the pandemic. However, it was still below 2019 pre-Covid levels.

*****

&gt; # 2. Supply chain woes, rising costs may make for rocky earnings

&gt; * Supply chain issues, labor shortages and higher energy prices are making this a very difficult quarter to model. As of Tuesday, 22 companies that are early reporters beat estimates by 11%, according to Nick Raich, CEO of The Earnings Scout. While this is above the traditional beat of 3% to 5%, it’s far below the average of prior quarters this year, including the roughly 18% beat for the second quarter. Third-quarter estimates, which had been rising steadily for months, have stopped in the last few weeks.

*****

&gt; # 3. September consumer prices expected to remain high

&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 1.57% on Wednesday ahead of what’s expected to be another elevated inflation report. The government at 8:30 a.m. ET releases the September consumer price index. Economists expect headline CPI and core CPI, which excludes the food and energy sectors, to be around the prior month’s year-over-year increases of 5.3% and 4%, respectively. The Federal Reserve at 2 p.m. ET releases minutes from its policy meeting in September when central bankers indicated they expect to begin reducing monthly asset purchases “soon,” but did not say when.

*****

&gt; # 4. White House aims to help key West Coast ports stay open 24/7

&gt; * President Joe Biden will unveil a plan Wednesday to try to ease West Coast port backlogs by expanding round-the-clock operations. The Port of Los Angeles is expected to announce a shift to 24/7 operations, following a similar transition by the Port of Long Beach in California last month. Central to this plan to ease supple chain disruptions are commitments by some of the nation’s leading retailers and shippers, including FedEx, UPS, Walmart and Home Depot, to increase overnight and off-hours operations at the ports to get the goods to market. Together, the ports account for about 40% of the shipping containers entering the United States.

*****

&gt; # 5. U.S. to reopen land borders in November for fully vaccinated

&gt; * The U.S. said Wednesday it will reopen its land borders to nonessential travel next month, ending a 19-month freeze due to Covid as the nation moves to require all international visitors to be vaccinated. Vehicle, rail and ferry travel between the U.S. and Canada and Mexico has been largely restricted to essential travel since the earliest days of the pandemic. The latest move follows last month’s announcement that the U.S. will end country-based travel bans for air travel and instead require Covid shots for foreign nationals seeking to enter by plane.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 11, 2021**

Stocks reversed coursed and ended lower today as investors continue to digest the September Jobs report, ongoing supply-side disruptions and wait for the beginning of earnings season to kick off later this week. The benchmark Treasury yield rose to 1.61%, its highest level since June, which puts pressure on technology stocks, and the price of crude oil continued its staggering rise, with Brent crude topping $84 a barrel, the highest price since 2018. 

In recent weeks, amid elevated global demand and persistent supply-side disruptions, the price of commodities, from oil and natural gas to cotton and coal, has exploded, with many currently at multi-year highs or record levels. A similar dynamic happened earlier in the year with the price of lumber, which eventually come back down to reasonable levels. I expect the price of commodities to recede once again as labor market imbalances are met and supply-side disruptions caused by the pandemic smooth over.

Last week, the Labor Department released its monthly jobs report, which showed non-farm payrolls rose by only 194,000 in September versus the 500,000 expected. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 4.8%, though this positive development came alongside a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate to 61.6%, versus 61.7% in August. And the size of the civilian labor force actually contracted in September, with the gap between the size of the labor force in February 2020 and last month topping 3 million. 

Though employers added just 194,000 jobs in September, the economy has now regained half of the jobs deficit it faced in December, compared with pre-pandemic employment levels. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last month that he'd only need to see a ""decent"" September U.S. jobs report to be ready to begin to taper in November. It is very likely the tapering of quantitative easing will be announced this month and commence in November. 

Looking ahead, market participants will receive the Bureau of Labor Statistics latest Consumer and Producer price indexes for September. Increases in core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, are expected to remain elevated. David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, said “Stagflation' was the most common word in client conversations this week as equity market volatility remained elevated. Stagflation is not our economists' base case expectation, but the weak historical performance of equities in stagflationary environments helps explain why investors are concerned."" As a reminder, stagflation refers to an environment in which economic growth is slow but inflation high. As Kostin said, I do not see this scenario moving forward as expectations for economic growth moving forward remain high. 

Earnings season, which is typically a very volatile time in equity markets, is set to kick off later this week, with big US banks reporting. 

**Highlights**

* The bounce in Chinese stocks was stopped in its tracks after the government announced it was investigating and seeking to curb ties between state financial institutions and private companies.
* China, the largest car market on Earth, also announced new regulations to limit and regulate the data sent abroad by vehicles, a blow to Western companies looking to expand in China.
* Longtime Disney (DIS) studio head Alan Horn will retire from the company. 
* Despite recent choppiness, the IPO market remains red-hot, with More than 2,000 IPOs raising a combined $421 billion globally by the end of September, a record high. That was more than double the proceeds raised during the same period last year, according to Refinitiv data.
* Microsoft (MSFT) and NVIDIA (NVDA) today announced that they trained what they claim is the largest and most capable AI-powered language model to date: Megatron-Turing Natural Language Generation.

Analysts at BCA Research wrote in their Strategy Report for clients on Sept. 20: “While the U.S. is not immune to disruptions in the rest of the world, it is a comparatively closed economy that is generally less susceptible to external troubles and has minimal financial links with the Middle Kingdom.”

But the early action on Monday showed that day-to-day events, even on the other side of the world, can unnerve investors, with energy, commodity and industrial stocks hit especially hard.

The BCA analysts went on to say that a review of filings for the largest U.S. banks showed that “only Citigroup, which operates a meaningful commercial banking franchise in Hong Kong, has direct cross-border exposures that amount to as much as 1% of assets.” Shares of Citigroup Inc. C were down 3.2% in the first few minutes of trading on Monday.

2021-09-09 22:13:21,r/stocks,Psycho Market Recap - Thur Sept 9,"**Summary**

Stocks opened higher in the morning before turning lower as market participants continue to balance a hot jobs market against a dent in economic momentum caused by surging coronavirus Delta variant cases in the US. The three major indexes are having one of the worst-performing streaks this year, while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fared slightly better.

According to a report released yesterday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of job openings in August was 10.9 million, higher than estimates of 9.9 million and the 10.18 million last month. The rate of job openings measured against the total labor force swelled to 6.9% in July, up from 6.5% the previous month and 4.6% a year ago. From an industry standpoint, the rate jumped to 10.7% from 10.2% in the critical leisure and hospitality field, which has suffered the most during the Covid-19 pandemic. Openings rose to 1.82 million, a total gain of 134,000 last month. There are enough job openings to cover the roughly 8.4 million unemployed Americans. 

Coinciding with an increase in job openings, in its latest Beige Book, which is basically a report by the Federal Reserve on current economic conditions, members said the economy downshifted slightly due to Delta variant concerns. The report stated, “The deceleration in economic activity was largely attributable to a pullback in dining out, travel, and tourism in most Districts, reflecting safety concerns due to the rise of the Delta variant, and, in many cases, international travel restrictions.” 

Members of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially closely at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the “substantial further progress mark” the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, “I think that one more good job report if it’s in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.” August was not the report they were looking for. 

Unfortunately, a summer that began with plunging coronavirus cases nationwide and real hope that the worst of the pandemic was behind us as the effective vaccination drive began is instead drawing to a close with the US firmly in throes of the pandemic once again, due to the highly contagious Delta variant. 

This weekend, hospitalizations were roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people traveled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling.

**Highlights**

* The crackdown in China continues… This time, regulators of video game companies execs to focus less on profits and implement controls to prevent video game addiction. Companies were “urged to break from the solitary focus of pursuing profit or attracting players and fans.
* Russian Cybersecurity firm Yandex (YNDX) said it successfully repelled the biggest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in history. This comes just after American company Cloudflare (NET) repelled the previously largest DDoS attack on Aug 19. The Yandex attack was 22 million requests per second, while Cloudflare’s was 17.2 million requests per second. Cybersecurity is becoming ever more important as attacks become more complex and powerful.
* Weekly first-time unemployment claims came in at 310,000, a pandemic-era low, well below estimates of 335,000
* JP Morgan (JPM) announced it was acquiring Infatuation, a company that owns different websites and apps that guide diners to restaurants in cities around the world from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). Could be to make a new dining credit card reward program or something
* Ray-Ban and Facebook (FB) have teamed up to release new smart glasses that have a camera, mic and speakers, and a voice assistant to let you do things hands-free, similar to Snapchat’s (SNAP) glasses. Honestly, I don’t know what these would be useful for right now
* With the NFL kicking off today, sports betting analysis firm PlayUSA says it expects over $20 billion to be wagered, nearly tripling the $7.5 billion wagered in 2020. I’m a huge sports fan and sports betting stock bull. My fav currently is PENN

2021-08-17 20:49:09,r/stocks,SOFI Valuation Analysis - No Hype,"Since there's no Net Earnings on this company yet (It's not profitable yet), we have to use P/S or PEG to value it. 

At $14/share it's a \~12 billion market cap, putting it at 12x Price to Sales for this year (assuming they hit their $980 mil revenue target - I personally think they are sandbagging and will print $1 billion revenue for 2021).

Comparing to SQ (\~8x P/S) and PYPL (\~13x P/S), SOFI is definitely valued quite rich at the current 12x P/S. I'm quite sure both PYPL and SQ had higher growth in their recent reporting than SOFI did, and they are also profitable. A ""fair"" P/S for SOFI would be closer to 5x, which would put us at around $6/share.

If you're not comparing to Fintechs like SQ and PYPL, you have to compare to traditional banks like BAC and JPM. In that case, it gets even worse for SOFI. That would put it at a 3-4x P/S if you want to value it in line with traditional banks.

This is obviously a very ""napkin math"" type of assessment, but it makes a lot of sense to me. There are also tons of competitors that do exactly the same things as SOFI like Ally Bank, and they are valued much lower.

So with all that said, poke holes in my analysis. Where and why is this wrong? Or am I right on the money and we should all buy Puts?",24,23,LuxGang,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p69rh9/sofi_valuation_analysis_no_hype/,p69rh9

2021-08-09 23:10:11,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, August 9, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, August 9, 2021**

Stocks finished mixed today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) both pulling back from all-time highs last week, pressured by a broad decline in crude energy stocks. The Nasdaq (QQQ) rose modestly. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 0.55%.  Like I have been saying the last few weeks, I expect the market to be quite choppy moving forward, as market participants continue to balance record-breaking corporate earnings and the expectation for economic expansion with rising concerns surrounding the coronavirus Delta variant and inflation. 

Oil prices fell over 2% to a three week low, extending recent losses in the sector as concerns that pandemic-era restrictions may be reinstated across Asia, especially China, which would reduce demand. In the face of rising cases, the world’s second largest economy has extended its border closure and implemented new travel restrictions between areas of high transmission and imposed widespread testing. China’s National Health Commission said it confirmed 125 new infections as of Sunday - the third straight day it reported 90 cases and above. Of the newly confirmed cases, 71 were locally transmitted, said the health commission. 

While those numbers are very small, it is important to note that the Chinese government has a so-called “zero-COVID” approach, meaning the government is sure to act very aggressively, much more than is feasible in Western countries, to stamp out the virus. Already, this week we've seen airline seat capacity in China plummet 32% compared to the week prior, the most since the early days of the pandemic. In an article circulated throughout state-sponsored media, Former Health Minister Gao Qiang wrote, “Is it feasible to ‘coexist with the virus’? The author believes that it is definitely not feasible. The ‘coexistence with the virus’ \[seen in\] Britain, the United States and other countries has already brought serious consequences to global efforts to contain the epidemic. We must not repeat the same mistakes.” I wouldn’t be surprised to see more and more restrictions implemented across China, despite the relatively low numbers they have so far. 

Neil Shearing, Chief Economist at Capital Economics wrote in a note, “Virus numbers are still very low compared to other countries. But the spread of the Delta variant calls into question China’s ‘zero-COVID’ approach. Whereas most governments are now starting to acknowledge that we are likely to have to live with the coronavirus for the long term, China’s ambition remains to keep it out of the country altogether. Without a shift in approach, this suggests that China will have to continue with occasional local lockdowns and restrictions on movement. This in turn will prevent a full return to pre-pandemic norms of consumer and business behavior, and is likely to mean that restrictions on foreign travel remain in place for some time to come.""

In response, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) slashed their growth outlooks for the near-future. For example, Goldman slashed its third-quarter real gross domestic product forecast to 2.3% from 5.8%, but lifted its fourth-quarter growth forecast to 8.5% from 5.8%.

However, while the Delta variant does pose a risk to global growth rates, in the US, the economy continues to recover at a remarkable rate. The Labor Department’s July Jobs Report marked an unexpected upswing in employment, with the economy adding 943,000 jobs to the 845,000 expected. The unemployment rate was 5.4%, also better than the 5.7% expected. With the coronavirus Delta variant forcing some parts of the US to reinstate some pandemic-era measures, like indoor mask mandates, market participants were closely waiting for this unemployment report. Like I said yesterday, this Job Report was a bit of a wild card, with estimates fluctuating widely from 330,000 to the high 900,000s. Earlier in the week a report by ADP suggested private payrolls were much weaker than expected, with only 330,000 private payrolls added versus the 700,000 expected. On the other hand, Bloomberg economists estimated a gain of more than 900,000 jobs. Happy to see the report come in so positive, a great sign, that despite headwinds remaining, the labor market continues to recover. 

As of Friday, 89% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) have reported earnings, with 87% of those topping estimates for earnings-per-share, according to data from FacSet. If this proportion holds, it would be the highest percentage of companies beating earnings since at least 2008, when FactSet began to track this data.

**Highlights**

* Followng Penn’s acquisition of the Score Media last week, DraftKings (DKNG) bought Golden Nugget Online Gaming (GNOG) for $1.56 billion
* Shares of Moderna (MRNA) continued their remarkably strong performance, gapping up more than 17% on the day. Stock up 200% in the last 3 months. 
* At the median, consumers expect inflation to rise by 4.8% over the next year,[ according to the New York Federal Reserve's monthly survey. ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-consumers-near-term-inflation-150329998.html)This matched June's reading, which was the highest level in the survey's history.  For the next three years, consumers expect inflation to rise by 3.7%, ticking up slightly from the 3.6% print from June and reaching the fastest pace expected since 2013.
* Job openings in the US were at a record-high in June, underscoring the way labor shortages and supply-side disruptions are capping the pace of recovery. 
* Car-rental company Hertz announced much stronger than expected corporate earnings this quarter and announced the intentions to re-list. I find this very funny, in my opinion, Hertz is one of the original meme stocks.

2021-07-28 22:31:04,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, July 28, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, July 28, 2021**

The market staged another remarkable reversal today, with many names that were hit yesterday clawing back their losses. The three major indexes were mixed, with Nasdaq (QQQ) climbing 0.35%. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) dipped towards the end of the session to close 0.6%  down. The Dow Jones (DIA), which tracks industrial and financial stocks, fell 0.37%. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed, rising 1.53% at the time of writing. Just like last Monday, today demonstrates that, while there are risks present in the market, investors and traders remain eager to buy up every dip.

Today, market participants continue to digest a slew of earnings reports, with three of the largest companies in the market, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) reporting yesterday. Today, after-hours, Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL) are reporting, among many others. 

Moreover, market participants also eyed the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) July Monetary Policy Report, which largely reiterated what members of the Fed have been saying for months, but did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Fed’s stated goals. The statement read, “Last December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings.” In other words, the Fed says substantial progress has been made and that in the coming months, we will increasingly begin to hear more about a timeline to taper quantitative easing. 

On inflation, the statement largely reiterated what it has in months past. The statement read, “Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses” and “The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer‑term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved.”

However, the report did acknowledge potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if “appropriate risks arise”. The statement read, “In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.”

Shares of Facebook (FB) fell 5% after-hours despite largely beating analyst after the company warned of a significant slowdown moving forward. Here are the numbers.

* **Earnings:** $3.61 per share, adjusted, vs. $3.03 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.
* **Revenue:** $29.08 billion, vs. $27.89 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.
* **Daily active users (DAUs):** 1.91 billion, vs. 1.91 billion as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.
* **Monthly active users (MAUs):** 2.90 billion, vs. 2.91 billion as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.
* **Average revenue per user (ARPU):** $10.12, vs. $9.66 as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.

Importantly, however, with respect to guidance, Facebook warned of a significant deceleration in growth moving forward. The company said it expects “year-over-year total revenue growth rates to decelerate significantly on a sequential basis as we lap periods of increasingly strong growth.”

**Highlights**

* Twitter (TWTR) stock surged roughly 5% before moderating after the company announced it was testing a new feature called the “Shop Module” that would enable businesses to sell their products directly through the Twitter platform. 
* Quarterly revenue for LinkedIn, the professional social network owned by tech giant Microsoft, surpassed $1 billion in the quarter for the first time.
* Youtube, which is owned by Alphabet, reported revenues of $7 billion for the quarter. To put into context how massive YouTube really is, Netflix (NFLX) had $7.3 billion in revenue this quarter, which has a $230 billion market-cap. It’s funny, in a world where the competition between streaming services for professional content is becoming increasingly more saturated, YouTube is poised to become and doesn’t spend billions to produce and acquire content. 
* Shares of chip-maker AMD gapped up today after the company beat earnings estimates and raised guidance moving forward that suggests the company will continue to take market share away from Intel. As I’ve said before, I think AMD and NVDA are the kings of this space.

Apple is leading the way. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google aren't far behind. The purpose of this post is the look at how much more value the top companies have gained in comparison to to the rest of the market. As of market close today, here's the indices:

&amp;#x200B;

|Index|Price|52-week range|Highs|Lows|Off highs|Off lows|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|S&amp;P 500|$4,358.69|$3,200.05 - $4,393.68|$4,393.68|$3,200.05|\-0.80%|36.21%|
|Nasdaq Composite|$14,631.95|$10,217.31 - $14,803.68|$14,803.68|$10,217.31|\-1.16%|43.21%|
|Dow Jones Industrial Average|$34,798.00|$25,992.28 - $35,091.56|$35,091.56|$25,992.28|\-0.84%|33.88%|
|Russell 2000 Index|$2,234.04|$1,432.57 - $2,360.17|$2,360.17|$1,432.57|\-5.34%|55.95%|

&amp;#x200B;

S&amp;P500, NASDAQ, and Dow are about 1% from its highs while the Russell Index is about 5%. All indices are way off its lows from 52 weeks ago (even more so from the bottom of the 2020 cash). Clearly the indices are doing ok. But what about the stocks in the S&amp;P500?

In this next chart, here's the value companies in the S&amp;P500 have made since 52 weeks ago (again, the gains should be much more than this since the 2020 lows).

**Marketcap valuation gained during the last 52 weeks**

||Top 5|Top 10|Top 20|Top 50|Top 100|Top 250|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$|$4.96T|$6.49T|$7.93T|$10.76T|$14.15T|$18.03T|
|%|23.69%|31.02%|37.87%|51.42%|67.62%|86.14%|

&amp;#x200B;

||Bottom 250|Bottom 100|Bottom 50|Bottom 20|Bottom 10|Bottom 5|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$|$2.9T|$780.77B|$340.88B|$92.3B|$38.79B|$13.11B|
|%|13.86%|3.73%|1.63%|0.44%|0.19%|0.06%|

The total value gained in the S&amp;P500 index since one year ago is $20.93 trillion! The top 5 companies contributed to about 24% of those gains and the top 250 companies contributed to basically all of it (\~86%).

As of right now, the S&amp;P500 index is now valued at $39.38 trillion, so the S&amp;P500 index has doubled in value since a year ago which is absolutely insane. Let's look at the valuations of these companies.

**Valuations of companies right now**

||Top 5|Top 10|Top 20|Top 50|Top 100|Top 250|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

&amp;#x200B;

**Top and Bottom Companies off their highs and lows**

||Top 5|Top 10|Top 20|Top 50|Top 100|Top 250|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|off the highs|\-2.56%|\-12.340%|\-9.13%|\-6.86%|\-6.79%|\-7.42%|

|off the lows|65.00%|67.48%|75.81%|67.54%|61.85%|56.65%​|

Top 10 includes Tesla, which is about 25% off its highs that's why you see the top 10 is -12% off its highs. Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index. The top 250 aren't doing so bad either. After that, the bottom 250 gets a bit ugly. The smaller caps did gain more overall up until their highs before they retreated.

Now let's look at how much carrying the top companies are doing.

**Companies in the S&amp;P500 for every 1-3% move**

Every 1% move Apple makes as of now, \~$24 is moved and the S&amp;P500 index moved \~0.06%. A 3% move would impact $72 billion dollars in valuation and has a 0.18% impact on the index. Doesn't seem much but the index is valued at almost $40 trillion dollars. Look at how much of an impact these stocks together make.

&amp;#x200B;

||1% move|2% move|3% move|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Top 5|0.23%|0.46%|0.69%|
|Top 10|0.3%|0.6%|0.9%|
|Top 20|0.391%|0.78%|1.17%|

The top 20 companies can make a 1%+ move if they averaged a 3% increase/decrease.

So what should I get out of this?

* The S&amp;P500 is top heavy - 23% of its valuation comes from the top 5 companies. 55% of its valuation from the top 50 companies. Almost 90% from the top 250 companies.
* S&amp;P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them.
* Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD.
* Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down.
* Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season.

Hope ya'll find this useful. Good luck to all.",99,13,reggiebergst,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/op2ket/the_top_five_us_public_companies_are_carrying_the/,op2ket
2021-07-20 04:07:26,r/stocks,"When the market gets very tough/choppy and turns red, sometimes our best strategy for trading is to go with what I called super defensive.","The last couple of days have been very tough. The Nasdaq down nearly 200 each day 1.5%. Honestly, it is surprising because for the most part earnings have been very good. GS, JPM, BAC, PACW, AN alot of companies coming with amazing numbers..... VOXX blew out top and bottom and was crushed!

Unfortunately, if you thought Friday was a dip… wow today! It is just very hard to time it, like the most of us...(we cant time it perfect), you found yourself buying the dip all day long! Yesterday for instance, I bought TIGR at 18.50 at first dip, thinking this was a steal it was just nearly 21.... then at 17.25... I told the elite group this is ridiculous I am going in..... I also mentioned today with examples why if I went completely defensive every single trade would have been green, but instead I was faked out by new highs on the market indexes.

So what we should do is buy what I call super defensive stocks which pay dividends anywhere between 8-10%. The reason being is when money flows from tech that alot of money will seek a safe haven. There is nothing more safer then a company that pays in cash 8-10% a year of the initial cost of shares. Unfortunately, as the stock price rises the yield comes down, which means if everyone follows this strategy we all cant win....unfortunately, the truth is on almost every trade there is a winner and a loser.... When you sell a stock you are doing so because you believe it is a higher and you can buy it again cheaper, or at a later date. When you buy a stock you are thinking you are getting an opportunity of a lifetime.

The reason we dont follow this principle always is because those stocks are not volatile and you are not able to make a lot on these trades. PSEC moves 20 cents a week.... TIGR moves 20-25% a day sometimes. Timed right TIGR is both a gift and a curse....

If things get bad. We must change strategy.",20,16,UltimateTraders,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/onsnlp/when_the_market_gets_very_toughchoppy_and_turns/,onsnlp
2021-07-15 16:07:12,r/stocks,JEPI - Capital Gains?,"
After looking for information about the next ex-dividend date for JEPI. I came across JP Morgan’s ETF distribution calendar that lists off the dates for each of their funds. [distribution calendar](https://am.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-am-aem/americas/us/en/supplemental/income-distribution-rates/jpmorgan-etfs-2021-distribution-notice.pdf). 

I noticed that JEPI has the option for a capital gains payout in addition to the regular monthly dividend payout. I did not notice them payout capital gains last year but that could have very well been since the ETF was brand new last year. Are capital gains something to be expected to be paid out in the future? Do most funds typically have that as an option and choose not to? I’m just trying to learn more because I’m a bit unfamiliar.

Disclosure: I own ~8 shares.

2021-07-14 22:21:52,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, July 14, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, July 14, 2021**

Stocks largely gained today in another volatile session, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) once again powering to new intraday highs, the third time this week for the SPY. The major indexes continue to be driven higher by continued strength in mega-cap tech stocks. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small caps, continued its streak of underperformance, trading 1.65% lower today at the time of writing. Market participants continue to digest new inflationary data, Q2 earnings season, and Jerome Powell’s testimony before Congress.

This week, the market is starting to experience signs of volatility, with the SPY opening the session firmly in the green before falling until about the middle of the session before recovering to close the day green. It seems to me that recent reports about inflationary data have injected some uncertainty into the market. The Labor Department’s June Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May’s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year’s pandemic-era lows.

Today, a report by the Labor Department showed that the Producer Price Index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 1% in June, accelerating to 7.3% rise year-on-year, while still reflecting base effects. Core PPI rse 5.5%. This is the fastest rate of increase since 2009.

While the CPI and PPI prints are not ideal, the market’s somewhat muted reaction (though there was a little volatility) seems to confirm that market participants are increasingly pricing in higher-than-expected inflationary data and are buying into the Federal Reserve’s argument that current pressures are transitory and due to pandemic-related disruptions. Moreover, it is very important to consider that current inflationary data is calculated on a year-on-year basis, so base effects are very much inflating the current numbers. In other words, inflationary readings are high because they are being measured using numbers from June 2020 when prices across the board collapsed as lockdowns and social distancing policies were implemented across the world. As I have said many times in the past, I am personally not yet worried about current inflationary pressures translating into a prolonged cycle of higher prices, though one always has to acknowledge the risks in the market and be prepared to act.

In other news, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave  his semi-annual monetary policy to Congress, where once again, he basically said the same thing he has been saying for months. Powell said “inflation will likely remain elevated in the coming months before moderating” and that the US economy was “still a ways” off from reaching the threshold of “substantial further progress” that would trigger the Central Bank to roll-back pandemic-era policies. In short, Powell basically said while he expects higher inflation prints in the coming months, pressures are transitory and due to pandemic era disruptions and the Fed’s goal for economic recovery have not been met. [Here is Powell’s complete testimony, but here are two of his most important quotes.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20210714a.htm)

**On the labor market:** “Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.”

**On inflation:** “Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy”.

**Highlights**

* Big banks continued to underperform today, with investors not impressed despite banks posting very strong earning reports. . JP Morgan, which is often considered a bellwether for the US economy given its sheer size, reported great results, driven in part by the release of $3 billion the bank had set aside to protect against potential losses from default loans during the pandemic, a sign that consumers held up better than the bank expected. JPM recorded revenues of $31.4 billion and profits of $11.948 billion, a staggering improvement from profits of $4.687 billion a year ago. One downside from the earnings report is a sharp reduction in revenues produced from trading, which is not surprising given the insane run by the market in 2020.
* Airline stocks initially gapped up in the morning after American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Airlines (DAL) offered upbeat outlooks for the second half of 2021, citing increasing consumer demand as the US continues to reopen. However, stocks were unable to hold onto their gains and largely finished negative.
* Twitter (TWTR) announced it was discontinuing its disappearing Fleets feature after failure to win traction with users.
* According to Facebook (FB), the company is pledging $1 billion to support content creators on its platforms through the end of 2022. Content creators will receive a monthly bonus if they hit milestones for earnings Stars, a form of digital tipping that fans can use to pay their favorite creators during live-streamed videos. Instagram's bonus programs will include incentives to use Reels, its copycat TikTok feature that showcases short-form video clips. Creators will earn money based on how their Reels videos perform, the company said.
* Microsoft (MSFT) is betting hybrid work will provide an opening to make its Windows operating system more widespread, launching a new service aimed at getting users of Apple (AAPL) and Android products to use the software. Windows 365, the company said, will be accessible on any device running any operating system that has a web browser, such as Apple Mac computers, iPhones and iPads, or those running Android software made by Alphabet (GOOGL)

Today was quite action-packed, with both the S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) once again recording a fresh intraday high for the second time this week before turning lower towards the end of the session. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, performed the worst, falling 1.75% at the time of writing. Market participants are digesting the beginning of Q2 earning season and a new report that showed in June, consumer prices have surged by the most since 2008.

The Labor Department’s June Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May’s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price of energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year’s pandemic-era lows.

While the CPI print is not ideal, the market’s somewhat muted reaction (though there was a little volatility) seems to confirm that market participants are increasingly pricing in higher-than-expected inflationary data and are buying into the Federal Reserve’s argument that current pressures are transitory and due to pandemic-related disruptions. Moreover, it is very important to consider that current inflationary data is calculated on a year-on-year basis, so base effects are very much inflating the current numbers. In other words, inflationary readings are high because they are being measured using numbers from June 2020 when prices across the board collapsed as lockdowns and social distancing policies were implemented across the world. As I have said many times in the past, I am personally not yet worried about current inflationary pressures translating into a prolonged cycle of higher prices, though one always has to acknowledge the risks in the market and be prepared to act. 

In other news, Q2 earnings seasons kicked off today, with two of the largest banks in the US, JP Morgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) both reporting today, as well as Pepsi (PEP). JP Morgan, which is often considered a bellwether for the US economy given its sheer size, reported great results, driven in part by the release of $3 billion the bank had set aside to protect against potential losses from default loans during the pandemic, a sign that consumers held up better than the bank expected. JPM recorded revenues of $31.4 billion and profits of $11.948 billion, a staggering improvement from profits of $4.687 billion a year ago. One downside from the earnings report is a sharp reduction in revenues produced from trading, which is not surprising given the insane run by the market in 2020. 

This quarter, earnings for companies in the SPY are expected to grow by 64% year-on-year, according to FactSet, which would mark the fastest rate of earnings growth since the fourth quarter of 2009, when the US was emerging from the 2008 housing-bubble induced recession. 

A big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to Q2 2020, a period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 2021 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.

Goldman Sachs strategist David Kosting said that market participants should focus on three questions heading into this earnings season: (1) How will companies deal with rising material costs and supply chain disruptions? (2) How are companies planning to prioritize cash spending? (3) How will companies deal with policy uncertainties, especially surrounding a potential tax hike?

In addition to earnings season, market participants are also looking forward to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell giving his semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to Congress Wednesday and Thursday of this week. Analysts are expecting Powell to once again strike a dovish tone (meaning unlikely to take aggressive action against inflation and instead favor employment), given the mixed June Job Report, which saw a better than expected number of jobs added to the economy but the unemployment rate tick higher and last week’s meeting minutes which showed an increasing divide between members regarding the timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing. In my view, Powell is trying to do three things in the upcoming meeting: (1) reiterate his view that the recovery of the economy is not yet complete, (2) inflation is a result of pandemic-era disruptions, and (3) prevent a repeat of the 2013 Taper Tantrum, a unwarranted, silly, collective market-panic that triggered a spike in U.S. Treasury yields after investors learned that the Federal Reserve was slowly putting the brakes on its quantitative easing program passed during the height of the 2008-09 recession. Moving ahead, further economic reports on consumer price inflation and retail sales out this week are expected to once again underscore that the pace of economic recovery in the US remains limited by supply chain disruptions and labor market imbalances.

**Highlights**

* Shares of Disney (DIS) outperformed the market again today thanks to the great success of Marvel’s “Black Widow”, which generated $80 million* in theater sales and $60 million* in streaming sales, the best domestic opening for a movie since the pandemic began. 
* Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk defended the electric-vehicle maker's purchase of SolarCity Corp. in court, telling a Delaware judge that he didn't act improperly during the negotiating process. This comes in response to a lawsuit filed by TSLA shareholders that allege Musk forced the company to buy SolarCity, a solar-cell manufacturer, in order to save his investment in the company.
* Netflix and Universal have reached a licensing deal that will see more Universal movies, including animated pictures from DreamWorks, available on its streaming platform. 
* Despite successfully completing the company's first trip with Richard Branson as a passenger, shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) remain under pressure after the company announced it planned to take advantage of the elevated stock price by selling $500 million in stock, with the stock down roughly 25% from Friday’s prices. 
* Broadcom (AVGO) is reportedly in talks to buy the SAS Institute, a software company with upwards of $3 billion a year in revenue in a deal valued between $15-$20 billion. This is yet another acquisition by one of the world’s largest semiconductor companies.
* Microsoft (MSFT) announced it was acquiring cybersecurity firm RiskIQ to help reduce risk amid “the increasing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks”.
* SolarWinds says that unknown hackers exploited a previously unknown flaw in two of its programs to go after ""a limited, targeted set of customers."" The company went on to say the hack was “completely unrelated” to last year’s attack” and that the company was still “unaware of the identity of the potentially affected customers”. Seems like hackers find it easy to attack this company.

2021-07-12 23:04:47,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, July 12, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, July 12, 2021**

After a spurt in volatility last Thursday, stocks have shaken off any jitteriness, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) once again powering to fresh intraday records today. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for Q2 earnings season to begin tomorrow, with two of the largest banks in the US, JP Morgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), reporting results and Jerome Powell’s testimony before Congress later this week.

With Q2 earnings are fast approaching, market participants are gearing up for what is expected to be a repeat of Q1 record-setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" This would represent a sharp acceleration from the 50% year-on-year growth recorded during Q1’s earnings season.

A big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to the year-earlier period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.

Goldman Sachs strategist David Kosting said that market pariticpants should focus on three questions heading into this earnings season: (1) How will companies deal with rising material costs and supply chain disruptions? (2) How are companies planning to prioritize cash spending? (3) How will companies deal with policy uncertainties, especially surrounding a potential tax hike?

In addition to earnings season, market participants are also looking forward to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell giving his semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to Congress Wednesday and Thursday of this week. Analysts are expecting Powell to once again strike a dovish tone (meaning unlikely to take aggressive action against inflation and instead favor employment), given the mixed June Job Report, which saw a better than expected number of jobs added to the economy but the unemployment rate tick higher and last week’s meeting minutes which showed an increasing divide between members regarding the timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing. In my view, Powell is trying to do three things in the upcoming meeting: (1) reiterate his view that the recovery of the economy is not yet complete, (2) inflation is a result of pandemic-era disruptions, and (3) prevent a repeat of the 2013 Taper Tantrum, an unwarranted, silly, collective market-panic that triggered a spike in U.S. Treasury yields after investors learned that the Federal Reserve was slowly putting the brakes on its quantitative easing program passed during the height of the 2008-09 recession. Moving ahead, further economic reports on consumer price inflation and retail sales out this week are expected to once again underscore that the pace of economic recovery in the US remains limited by supply chain disruptions and labor market imbalances.

Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab said, “I think the recovery is on track, it’s really just the rate of change that has slowed. We couldn’t continue to grow at 9-10% GDP growth every quarter, so obviously it’s going to slow down. I think one of the things that got into markets that got \[Treasury\] yields tumbling was maybe the fact that the Fed was going to hike rates sooner than anticipated. That sends a signal to the long end of the bond market that maybe the Fed isn;t going to tolerate higher inflation for longer and that they’re going to step on the brakes sooner rather than later ... we don't think that's going to be the case though. We think the economy is doing well, yields will probably bounce back."" I agree with this sentiment. 

**Highlights**

* Over the weekend, Richard Branson became the first civilian to go to space with his own company Virgin Galactic (SPCE), a remarkable milestone as companies like Bezos’ Blue Origin and Musk’s SpaceX intensify competition in space tourism.
* Despite successfully completing the trip, shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) fell more than 10% after the company announced it planned to take advantage of the elevated stock price by selling $500 million in stock.
* Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk on Monday defended the electric-vehicle maker's purchase of SolarCity Corp. in court, telling a Delaware judge that he didn't act improperly during the negotiating process. This comes in response to a lawsuit filed by TSLA shareholders that allege Musk forced the company to buy SolarCity, a solar-cell manufacturer, in order to save his investment in the company. Frankly, this lawsuit seems a little ridiculous to me given SolarCity has proven a smart acquisition.
* Walt Disney (DIS) said on Sunday that “Black Widow”, the newest Marvel movie, made $80 million in theater sales, the largest domestic opening weekend since “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” in 2019, a strong sign that appetite to go to the movies remains high among Americans. Comparatively, “Black Widow” made $60 million through streaming purchases.
* In yet another crackdown of big-tech companies, Chinese regulators are reportedly set to order Tencent (TCEHY) to give up their exclusive rights to music labels and pay a small fine.
* Broadcom (AVGO) is reportedly in talks to by SAS Institute, a software company with upwards of $3 billion a year in revenue in a deal valued between $15-$20 billion. This is yet another acquisition by one of the world’s largest semiconductor companies.

2021-07-07 02:45:13,r/stocks,"How do I know or could tell if I overpaid for a stock? Is there a rule I could use? Strategy, is there a science? Explained","I wanted to let everyone know there is an exact formula where you could tell if you overpaid for this stock, relative to its own history, relative to the market, and relative to the peers. Before I do this, I want to remind you I am not telling you what to do and I am not trying to talk down your security. These are facts, not opinions, and if you are upset about the facts, it is not my fault. It is your choice if you still decide to stay in the security or not. I also remind you that I do not control stock prices, bidders do, so just because fair value is far below doesn't mean it will ever hit that valuation as long as someone is willing to bid. For instance, and I dont think this will cause alot of anger, AMZN based on my evaluation is worth about $1,400..... It trades at $3,000+ but may never drop as long as someone is willing to bid.

**My own rule and this is my own no one says this or tells me this. Do not buy a company with 0 PE, a company that loses money (Bottom Line) Unless revenues/sales is growing at least 50% year over year (Top Line)** This is not to say that you can not make money on a company that loses money and has slower growth, I personally will pass and not take the risk.

So let's get into this and use company's that everyone knows. For each sector I will choose 3 different companies. Instead of boring you with all the exact top, bottom line numbers I am just telling you, ""**How to tell if I overpaid for my stock or I got a steal! Relative to that stock, relative to the stock market and relative to the sector""** By the way this isn't some made up theory or mumbo jumbo or some formula that analysts use to reinforce their sales targets. So please focus and pay attention. I will cover 2 sectors, 3 companies in these 2 sectors. You can do this for free yourself I am going to tell you how.

Banks

Banks are relatively stable, pay dividends, usually have steady earnings, sales and are usually a great conservative sector. **I like to use Morningstar, you can can probably get the information in many places but I am a creature of habit I have traded since 1995.**

The first bank I will look at is C Citigroup, 2/26/2021, Closing price of $66, PE ratio 13.52, EPS 4.87. These details are very important because I am trying to tell you how you can tell if you overpaid for this stock now, relative to its past, the market and its peers. **I go on morningstar, I type in the symbol, (By the way I am not going to tell you step by step for these 6 securities, this first 1 and thats it!!! Hopefully, you get the idea)** I then click on financials. Quickly I see a bunch of ratios, revenue growth, return on equity. I am telling you I love this site, if they were to charge me $20 a month I would pay it, but shhhh don't tell them. I then scroll down and I see 2017, 2018, 2019 and I see year to date. Now I do own JPM, and that will be discussed shortly, I dont want the reader to think there is any bias I am just telling you how to read this. I immediately see how slow the growth it is, it seems less then 5% (Top Line), Bottom Line EPS went up gradually as well. What does that mean? If last year you paid above $60 a share you are still getting a pretty good deal relative to itself because top line, bottom line does show some appreciation. There are other factors I am telling you a quick way. Relative to the market (S&amp;P) that is easy because the PE is 13.52 and it trades cheaper then the index (banks relatively do). Finally, is this a good buy or should I look at BAC or the leader (We pay a higher premium, multiple for industry leaders) JPM.

BOA Bank of America 34.71, PE ratio 18.55 EPS 1.87. Immediately you see sales and earnings are pretty much the same. So this should not be higher than it was last year, you can than check the chart. The numbers do not merit this 18.55 multiple. So if it was cheaper, I am sorry it should be! If you are holding BAC I am not saying sell, but you are now paying higher than last year. S&amp;P as we said, banks trade lower. Relative to C, I would buy C based on the fundamentals because their is more growth in top and bottom lines and it trades lower!!!

The Industry leader, many of us pay a premium and if it has a higher multiple you just pay for it, its natural. I do own it

JPM Chase, 115.08, PE ratio 34, EPS 3.38, Sales have gradually gone up but earnings have gone down, me personally, (and I do have it long term), after seeing these fundamentals if the next quarter they do not beat by a lot I would get out, there is a drop off in earnings and it has this PE.....I don't know exactly what it traded a year ago, but it deserves to be lower, so definitely do not pay more. This is the leader so trades above the SP. Relative to the peers and a drop off of earnings, I personally would not get in, it is trading at a higher premium and I am not sure if it deserves it.

**If you have a stock and you are unsure of its peers, go on yahoo finance type in the symbol and it usually shows you peers on the far right, it is important to see how it trades compared to its peers. Which I am going over on this next sector.**

**Finally it is very hard to use any formula for a company in the red, losing money because how can you calculate what you should pay for a loser!!**

Automobiles

Usually these are safe, have high debt though and have multiples near 10-15 because the debt and slowing growth.

F Ford 11.70, PE ratio 11, EPS 1.06, Sales are down and so is earnings. So relative to itself, and its trading near highs (I do own it) I would not add, last year about this time it was 8-9. People are paying a higher premium on EV and expect future... possible but the current numbers do not. Car's trade lower than SP. Lets see to its peers

GM General Motors 51.33, PE ratio 11.85 EPS 4.33, Sales are also down and earnings as well... So this is the same story and traders are paying a premium based on it's past hoping for a better future. SP same story and relative to F i would say these are trading about the same.

Industry leader

TM Toyota 147.93, PE ratio 12.11, EPS 12.21 Sales are actual even and earnings are actually up, I would say that this is actually cheap, so if you like TM this is a good entry point. Also, this is the leader and deserves a high PE. Relative to its peers, TM is much better, not even by a little.

Hope this helps, you can do this with any industry or stock.",0,0,UltimateTraders,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/of840b/how_do_i_know_or_could_tell_if_i_overpaid_for_a/,of840b

2021-06-25 22:40:34,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, June 25, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, June 25, 2021**

***Please note:*** *I've seen a lot of questions surrounding the analyst price target upgrades that I post, so I just wanted to clear some things up and explain my reasoning behind including them.*

*I frequently get asked if I think analyst price target predictions are ""accurate"" or if I expect a stock I mention to hit the price predicted.* ***The answer to both these questions is NO.*** 

*I really don't put much, if any importance, on the actual numbers predicted by an analyst. They are just a meter to gauge how bullish or bearish they are. My purpose in including price target upgrades is to find trends in analyst thinking. In other words, if I see a bunch of different, well-known analysts all giving bullish target increases on a stock, I'll start doing research on a stock to see why they are so bullish. I have found quite a few profitable trades in this manner.*

***In short, the purpose of the price target upgrades is idea generation. Keep an eye out if you start seeing the same stock receiving bullish target increases by different analysts.***

Stocks were mixed, but mostly positive today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) recording a fresh intraday high and the Dow Jones (DIA) nicely continuing its recovery after falling last week, driven higher by a boost in bank stocks across the board after the Fed removed all pandemic-era restrictions on capital distributions. The Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly after several days of reaching new all-time highs. The core personal consumption expenditures, which serves as the Fed’s preferred gauge for inflation was released but did not adversely affect the market, another signal the market is prepared to stomach higher than usual inflationary readings as the economy continues to recover. 

The core PCE index measures the changes in prices paid by consumers for goods and services, minus volatile food and energy prices, which are staples and therefore not considered in the equation. The report registered a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, in-line with Wall Street estimates and marking the fastest jump since 1992. However, it is important to note that the report is still reflecting “base effects” as prices rebound from the pandemic-induced collapse last year. 

Yesterday, the Federal Reserve released the results of its “stress test” on US banks, an annual test instituted after the 2008 financial crisis meant to determine the financial health of lenders during an extreme hypothetical financial crisis (not unlike what was experienced last year).The test used a hypothetical “severely adverse” scenario where the U.S. economy saw GDP shrink by 4%, the unemployment rate rise to 10.75%, and the stock market contract by 55%. In the end, the test showed the 23 largest banks could withstand $474 billion in losses from loans and other positions and still emerge with more than double the minimum required capital.

The results of this stress test are extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Given the clean bill of health, these restrictions have now been fully lifted, paving the way for banks across the board to raise dividends and ramp up stock buyback programs. To put in extent how much money this is, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters.

In other news, President Joe Biden announced he had reached an infrastructure agreement with a bipartisan group of senators, which catalyzed a jump in industrial stocks that had been lagging the last few weeks. The deal, which would cost $1.2 trillion over the next five years, commits  $312 billion toward traditional infrastructure priorities such as roads, bridges, public transit, airports and waterways. The bulk of the remainder will be invested in water, broadband and power grid restoration, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. 

Gabriela Santos, global market strategist at JP Morgan said, “The way we're thinking about it is, it has the positive side of the deal in terms of the equity market perspective: More spending on physical infrastructure, electric vehicles, 5G and broadband, without the tax increases which would have been a negative from the equity market perspective. This is certainly a positive especially for the more domestic, cyclical-heavy parts of the market, as well as parts of technology like semiconductors, which are more related to the 5G and the green theme.""

2021-06-24 22:53:01,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, June 24, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, June 24, 2021**

The market edged higher once again, with both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) driven higher by an incredible rally in technology stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA), which suffered its worst performance since October 2020 last week continued to recover, pushed higher by a rally in bank and industrial stocks. “Reopening stocks” like cruise lines, hotels, and airlines continue to underperform the market, pressured by the rotation back to growth and concerns that inflation will drive prices in this sector higher. 

After driving the market higher in the beginning of the year, the last two or so months have seen the market firmly rotate from value and cyclical stocks back to growth and technology stocks due to recent inflationary numbers and labor market disruption that threaten to drive prices for services in this sector higher. However, as I have said previously, while I acknowledge the risk, I am not yet concerned that current inflation will become a persistent threat, at least in the near-term. While that may change and I advise people to be ready in case the Fed is forced to tighten rates sooner-than-expected, I expect value and cyclicals to continue recovering as the US economy continues to reopen. With the stock market’s great performance in the last 12-14 months and government coronavirus stimulus, I expect savings-laden consumers to spend big this summer after being cooped up indoors for so long. 

Keith Lerner, Portfolio and Market Strategist at Truist Securities said, “The value trade is still intact. It got overcrowded, it got over-loved ... but when we look at the fundamental drivers behind that trade, they're still intact. So the first thing is, context. Yes, they had a big run this year, but they've trailed for about 14 years, so we've had a long underperformance cycle,"" he added. ""And the second part is, why did they underperform for so long is because we had really slow economic growth. And this year and next we expect above-trend economic growth. And the earnings momentum and the earnings leverage for these areas is still positive."" 

Later today, the Fed is set to release the results of its “stress test” on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. **If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge if it happens.** 

On Friday, Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting ""base effects"" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the board

* **As I was finishing the recap the news is out, the Fed is ending pandemic-era restriction on banks in stock buybacks and dividend increases.

* After being under pressure in recent months, shares of Tesla (TSLA) have begun rallying again, with the stock up more than 10% this week alone. 
* Today, Microsoft will unveil the long-awaited sequel to Windows 10. Windows 11, the product's first new version in almost six years, includes only limited changes to its visual design, but it seeks to reposition the operating system as a hub in a computing universe incorporating rival companies' platforms, including Android mobile software developed by Google and a digital storefront developed by Amazon (AMZN).[ Read more here ](https://www.cnet.com/news/microsofts-windows-11-reveal-event-every-upgrade-announced/)
* The House Judiciary Committee voted on Thursday to approve the final piece of its six-part package, the ""Ending Platform Monopolies Act,"" which restricts big tech companies' ability to leverage their platform dominance to promote other lines of business and disadvantage competitors. The vote on the bill was 21-20. The bill will now move on to the House floor and, if passed there, the Senate. The bill is newsworthy but pretty much doomed to fail.
* Snapchat (SNAP) users globally will get access to Universal Music Group's library of recorded music and content for their own content-making on the social media platform, the companies said Thursday. This move comes as US social media companies across the board continue to implement more “TikTok-like” features. To show just how much TikTok has grown, parent company ByteDancehas a market cap of roughly $250 billion, almost $100 billion more than Snap and Twitter (TWTR) combined.

Stocks rose again today, as inflationary concerns continue to abate, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) powering to a new fresh intraday high driven by the continued rallies in mega-cap tech stocks like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) continues to hover 2-3 points below its record high while the Dow Jones (DIA) continues to recover after suffering its worst performance since October 2020 last week. 

In a meeting with the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell once again reiterated that interest rates will not be raised on inflation fears alone and sees current pressures as transitory. Powell said, “We will not raise interest rates preemptively because we fear the possible onset of inflation. We will wait for evidence of actual inflation or other imbalances.” He went on to further say recent price increases “don’t speak to a broadly tight economy that would require higher interest rates” but come from factors “directly affected by the reopening”. Powell then went on to further reiterate the Central Bank is keeping a close eye on a “broad set of labor market statistics” before any adjustment to the current policy is considered. He said “We will not just look at the headline numbers for unemployment. We will look at all kinds of measures…. That is the most important thing we can do to ensure the benefits of the recovery are more fully shared”. 

As expected, response by lawmakers to Powell’s testimony, no surprise, split squarely down partisan lines, with Democrats focusing on labor market imbalances and unemployment and Republicans focusing on concerns surrounding inflation. I do not place much, if any, weight on what was said by lawmakers, just interested in what Powell had to say. 

Looking ahead, market participants are gearing up for Q2 earnings, with analysts expecting a repeat of Q1 record setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand by savings-laden consumers as the US economy is finally open to begin broadly reopening thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine.  So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher.""

which stocks do you think have room to fall?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Commodities-related stocks, like energy names and materials shares, were down sharply Thursday afternoon. Energy was the worst-performing S&amp;P 500 sector, falling 3.5%. Materials lost 2.2%.  
&gt;  
&gt;Financial stocks fell on the flatter yield curve, but REITs were slightly higher. Technology stocks rose 1.2%, and health care gained 0.8%.

&amp;#x200B;

energy, materials, financial, all down. Probably missed a lot of the move on the sell side.

but would you bet there's still some downside to capitalize on, or are people gonna be buying the dip Monday?

X, CLF, have pulled back a lot.

lumber is a falling knife. Looks very shortable with lots of room to fall on lumber related stocks

technical analysis fans, what do you think are support levels for shit like BAC C JPM X CLF WY XOM FANG etc?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Strategist expect some of the Fed reaction is just temporary**, and reflects investors who were too far offsides in some positions.  Commodities had already begun falling ahead of the Fed announcement, after China announced plans to release metals reserves.
