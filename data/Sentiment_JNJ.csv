$PEN is a medical device company that specializes especially in thrombectomy (removal of blood clots) which they are pretty much the market leader. they have always been priced at a frosty P/E because they pretty much have a monopoly in the space and the market is pricing them at a premium for that luxury

basically, when a person has a life threatening bloodclot, they stick in a catheter in and they have proprietary software that can determine whether they are removing blood or the clot as desired, it's a very specialized procedure that saves a ton of lives. 

that being said, this stock has the most predictable trading pattern ever known to mankind. Every time this stock touches the low 300s, it sells off to the low 200s. you can open the chart and see this trading pattern for the last 5 years.

the reason it has been selling off recently has nothing to do with the company itself - the market has been selling off medical device companies while the market rallies to all time highs in a rare sector rotation out of the industry, most likely to fomo into the AI tech rally (see MDT, JNJ, ABT). i expect this sector rotation to be short lived and the sector to be bought into again as the market continues to roar higher

you would be buying into a great company with a stellar balance sheet and improving margins each quarter. the company has everything you want to see in your holdings - no debt, flush with free cash flow and consistent sequential topline growth

TLDR - price target 300,

2025-07-30 15:17:13,r/stocks,EURUSD falls to lowest since early July What does this mean for equities and macro?,"With the recent macro situation, this could have a knock-on effect on equities and risk assets:

This morning, the EURUSD fell to its lowest since early July and is currently hovering around 1.0800. That's not a small drop, and a few days ago we were near the top of 1.09.

There are probably a few reasons at the heart of this decline: 

US economic data was too strong 

Q2 GDP was revised upwards to 2.8% (previously 2.3%).

Core PCE (the Fed's most watched inflation indicator) was higher than expected.

These data strengthened the market's expectations that the Fed will “keep interest rates high for longer” and made the dollar stronger.

ECB releases dovish signals 

Eurozone inflation data showed some easing.

Germany's latest PMI data is very weak, recession fears are rising again.

Some ECB officials are starting to sound cautious, and the market expects that rate cuts could start in early 2026 (and there are even suggestions that they could be possible by the end of 2025).

Safe-haven capital is pouring into the dollar 

Geopolitical situations are heating up (e.g. Ukraine, global trade tensions), allowing the dollar to attract a lot of capital as a safe-haven asset.

Meanwhile, U.S. bond yields remain firm 10-year U.S. bonds are close to 4.3%.

What does this mean for the markets?

Large tech stocks and those companies that are heavily influenced by the dollar (e.g., $AAPL, $MSFT, $META) could be under pressure, especially since a good portion of their revenue comes from Europe.

Multinationals (e.g., $PG, $KO, $JNJ) could take a loss in Q3 earnings due to exchange rate losses.

Eurozone stocks (which can be followed via the $EZU or $FEZ ETFs) could be pressured by economic weakness, but a weak euro favors German exporters, such as automakers.

Dollar-denominated commodities (e.g., gold, crude oil) could come under pressure in the short term due to a stronger dollar, unless macro risks push up safe-haven demand, such as gold.

My take?

Short-term weakness in the euro is justified, but the next thing to watch is whether US inflation continues to “stick”, and the Fed's attitude at its annual meeting in Jackson Hole at the end of August. If Powell is hawkish again, we could see EUR/USD fall to 1.07 or even 1.06.

Is anyone hedging their exchange rate risk with forex manipulation, long DXY (dollar index) options, or in company earnings reports?

2025-07-17 07:49:17,r/ValueInvesting,Slowly Building My Defensive Portfolio,"Hi

I’ve been slowly building my portfolio and lately I’ve been focusing more on defensive stocks. With all the market volatility and uncertainty, I’ve realized it’s not just about chasing growth, it's about having a foundation that holds up when things get rough.

Been reading a bunch, and one deep dive that really stuck with me broke down what makes a stock *truly* defensive not just high dividend yield or “safe sector” labels. It made the case that real defensive names tend to share a few things:

* They sell products people need regardless of the economy
* They generate predictable cash flow
* And they keep debt low while steadily raising dividends

Based on that lens, here are some of the names I’m seriously looking into right now:

Procter &amp; Gamble ($PG) is kind of the go-to for this category. I mean, people aren’t going to stop buying toothpaste or diapers just because rates are up.

Johnson &amp; Johnson ($JNJ) also has my attention with solid mix of pharmaceuticals and consumer health, and they’ve been raising dividends for a very long time now.

Coca-Cola ($KO) just makes sense to me. Their pricing power and global reach are hard to ignore. Honestly feels like one of those stocks you can tuck away for years.

Walmart ($WMT) is interesting too. It actually tends to do well in downturns, since people trade down to save money. Nice built-in hedge there.

NextEra Energy ($NEE) has that stable utility income, but they’re also leaning hard into renewables, which adds a bit of long-term growth potential.

UnitedHealth Group ($UNH) is one I’m still researching, but combining healthcare with insurance seems like a pretty safe long-term bet.



Still early in the process, but trying to build something I can hold through the next 10–15 years and sleep well at night doing it.

2025-07-12 07:54:44,r/ValueInvesting,Alaska Permanent Fund a good portfolio for individual stocks?,"When Trump signed that executive order in February to explore creating a national wealth fund, I didn’t think much of it. But the more I read, the more I kept seeing comparisons to the Alaska Permanent Fund.

For context: Alaska set up this fund in the 1970s to invest oil and mineral revenues for future generations. It’s grown into an $7 billion portfolio and pays dividends directly to state residents every year. Not a bad track record for government-run investing.

I started digging into what they actually hold, and while a big chunk is in index ETFs (which makes sense for size and stability), there are also some individual stock picks that caught my attention:

* Berkshire Hathaway – $38 million
* AT&amp;T – $30 million
* Johnson &amp; Johnson – around $25 million
* Cisco Systems – about $24.7 million
* T-Mobile – also $24.7 million

That combo of telecoms, healthcare, and a Buffett anchor position is interesting. I'm tempted to just mirror a slice of this portfolio in my own. Anyone else ever looked into the Alaska Permanent Fund before this? Or already own any of these?

2025-05-12 15:15:04,r/stocks,(05/12) Interesting Stocks Today - Major Reductions in Tariffs!,"This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

I don't know how sustained today's move will be- we've made a massive move upwards, and even 30% tariffs will still reduce business with China by 70% in the medium term (\~6 to 9 month timeframe)

News: [Us And China Agree To Major Reductions In Tariffs For 90 Days](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-12/us-and-china-agree-to-major-reductions-in-tariffs-for-90-days)

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&amp;p=d) **/** [**AMZN (Amazon)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN&amp;p=d)\- Both stocks are up \~6% following announcement of a 90-day suspension of U.S.-China tariffs, reducing U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%. Watching $214/$215 in AAPL and seeing if we can make another move higher. Currently long. Obviously this is a 90-day suspension and not actually a guarantee that things will return back to normal. Everything in consumer disc is moving off this news. Risks I'm seeing from this are potential re-escalation of trade tensions and more supply chain disruptions, and I'm thinking of possibly flipping short if we make a massive move upwards.

[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&amp;p=d) **/** [**JD (JD.com)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JD&amp;p=d)\- Chinese tech stocks like BABA and JD are also major winners of tariffs, with both up roughly 6%, following the 90-day agreement. Watching $135 level (basically just seeing which Chinese stocks are close to breaking highs). Risks are the same as American stocks. Other notable stocks I like on this are BIDU/TCEHY (trades OTC)

[**PFE (Pfizer)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PFE&amp;p=d) **/** [**MRK (Merck)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MRK&amp;p=d) **/** [**JNJ (Johnson &amp; Johnson)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JNJ&amp;p=d)\- Trump announced plans to sign an executive order implementing a ""most-favored-nation"" policy to reduce U.S. prescription drug prices by up to 59%. This policy aims to ""align"" U.S. drug prices with the lower prices paid by other countries. Obviously pretty terrible news for anyone investing in pharmaceutical stocks because it affects major revenue sources for this company. The US has limited direct negotiating and mainly relies on private pharmacy benefit managers to negotiate prices in insurance plans currently, which results in sky-high insurance costs. I'm Interested in MRK, we're already broken lows (even during the tariffs) because MRK is highly dependent on Medicare reimbursement (MRK).

[**BP (BP)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BP&amp;p=d)\- BP up on reports that several major oil companies, including Shell, Chevron, and ExxonMobil, are evaluating potential takeover bids. BP is considered undervalued, with a market cap of £57B against asset valuations of \~£120B. No levels I'm watching at this time.

This is the THIRD time the company's bankruptcy strategy has been blocked in court. JNJ has always moved significantly off these updates (first and second rejections were in 2021/2022 because it means they have to pay out billions), overall not too interested in a short, but maybe a long if we sell off significantly- we always recover from these types of moves.

[**NMAX (NMAX)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NMAX&amp;p=d)\- NMAX experienced a surge of over 700% in the IPO yesterday, shares are currently above $100 (from an initial IPO opening of \~$15). This is similar to DJT all those years back (which was renamed), more interested in a short around $130. Worth noting $100 was the level yesterday afterhours and we sold off from there, broke it today. There's usually a pop in these conservative news outlets when they IPO, mainly interested in the short today.

[**MRNA (Moderna)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MRNA&amp;p=d)\- Dr. Peter Marks, head of the FDA's vaccine program, has resigned, citing conflicts with RFK Jr. Also, 10K FDA employees were fired today. Read through from this is all actions done through FDA will be far, far slower because of all the employees fired, so these pharma/biotech companies will potentially move far slower as well.

We saw pretty big moves in MRNA and NVAX yesterday (7% move in MRNA!!) , we may see continuation of the selloff today due to the new news of the FDA employees. Watching the $6 in NVAX, and $26 in MRNA.

&gt;

&gt;We recently compiled a list of the [**Top 10 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/top-10-dividend-stocks-to-buy-according-to-hedge-funds-1464133/). We recently compiled a list of the [**Top 10 Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/top-10-dividend-stocks-to-buy-according-to-hedge-funds-1464133/). In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against the other dividend stocks.

&gt;The sustained high inflation over the past two years has resulted in increased borrowing costs, posing difficulties for both businesses and consumers. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding potential interest rate cuts by central banks, regulatory changes under the new US administration, and ongoing geopolitical tensions have further dampened economic activity. In this challenging landscape, competition for capital has intensified, with companies focusing on their competitive advantages and adjusting their strategies for both short-term stability and long-term growth to secure essential resources amid rising economic uncertainty.

&gt;Dividends are becoming increasingly attractive in the current market environment. A report from S&amp;P Global indicates that global dividend growth saw a significant boost in 2024, rising by 8.5%. This growth was especially notable in the Asia-Pacific region, where government policies encouraged companies to shift from annual to semiannual dividend distributions. Meanwhile, the US market experienced a surge in new and reinstated dividends, with the technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) sector playing a key role in driving this trend. The report also pointed out that over the past decade, companies across the broader market—excluding real estate investment trusts (REITs)—have, on average, distributed 85% of their discretionary cash flow (DCF), which is calculated as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. On average, this distribution has been divided between dividends and share buybacks, with 47% allocated to dividends and 38% directed toward buybacks.

&gt;Global dividend growth had been slowing since the post-COVID recovery, but that trend reversed last year, with the growth rate accelerating to 8%. Shareholders received approximately $180 billion more in payouts than in 2024, which came as a surprise given the prevailing geopolitical and economic uncertainties, according to an S&amp;P Global report. The firm projects that total global dividend payments will remain at $2.3 trillion in 2025.

&gt;Analysts point out that earnings growth has traditionally been the key driver of dividend increases. With strong earnings growth recorded last year, expectations for 2025 are even higher. Goldman projects an 11% rise in earnings per share this year, up from an estimated 8% in 2024, which is expected to drive a 7% increase in dividends, compared to a 6% rise last year. Meanwhile, Ohsung Kwon, a US equity strategist at BofA Securities, holds an even more optimistic view, forecasting a 12% dividend boost this year, supported by accelerating earnings growth.

&gt;Historically, dividends accounted for 40% of the market’s total returns from 1936 to 2012, but their contribution has dropped to just 16% over the past decade, according to a BofA Securities research note published late last year. However, Kwon expects dividends to play a more substantial role in overall market returns moving forward. In view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks according to hedge funds.

&gt;Our Methodology

&gt;For this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds and identified the top 10 companies that pay regular dividends to shareholders and have dividend yields of at least 1%, as of February 25. This means the stocks mentioned in this list are the most popular dividend stocks among the elite hedge funds in America. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in the companies.

&gt;Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ([**see more details here**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/premium/newsletters/quarterly)).

In addition to its pharmaceutical business, the company is a major player in the medical device industry, providing further diversification. Its financial performance remains stable and reliable. Since the start of 2025, the stock has surged by nearly 15%.

&gt;In the fourth quarter of 2024, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) reported $22.5 billion in revenue, marking a 5.2% increase from the prior year. As a prominent healthcare company, it remains focused on developing treatments for diseases with substantial unmet needs, including multiple myeloma, lung cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and heart failure. The MedTech division recorded a 6.2% rise in global operational sales, with acquisitions and divestitures contributing 1.5% to this growth. Strong demand for electrophysiology products and Abiomed supported growth in the Cardiovascular segment, while the General Surgery unit saw increased sales of wound closure products.

&gt;Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s quarterly dividend currently comes in at $1.24 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.00%, as of February 25. The company maintains one of the longest dividend growth streaks in the market, spanning 62 years.

&gt;Overall JNJ ranks 8th on our list of the dividend stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for JNJ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than JNJ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the [**cheapest AI stock**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/cheapest-ai-stock-with-10000-return-potential/).In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against the other dividend stocks.

&gt;The sustained high inflation over the past two years has resulted in increased borrowing costs, posing difficulties for both businesses and consumers. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding potential interest rate cuts by central banks, regulatory changes under the new US administration, and ongoing geopolitical tensions have further dampened economic activity. In this challenging landscape, competition for capital has intensified, with companies focusing on their competitive advantages and adjusting their strategies for both short-term stability and long-term growth to secure essential resources amid rising economic uncertainty.

&gt;Dividends are becoming increasingly attractive in the current market environment. A report from S&amp;P Global indicates that global dividend growth saw a significant boost in 2024, rising by 8.5%. This growth was especially notable in the Asia-Pacific region, where government policies encouraged companies to shift from annual to semiannual dividend distributions. Meanwhile, the US market experienced a surge in new and reinstated dividends, with the technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) sector playing a key role in driving this trend. The report also pointed out that over the past decade, companies across the broader market—excluding real estate investment trusts (REITs)—have, on average, distributed 85% of their discretionary cash flow (DCF), which is calculated as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. On average, this distribution has been divided between dividends and share buybacks, with 47% allocated to dividends and 38% directed toward buybacks.

&gt;Global dividend growth had been slowing since the post-COVID recovery, but that trend reversed last year, with the growth rate accelerating to 8%. Shareholders received approximately $180 billion more in payouts than in 2024, which came as a surprise given the prevailing geopolitical and economic uncertainties, according to an S&amp;P Global report. The firm projects that total global dividend payments will remain at $2.3 trillion in 2025.

&gt;Analysts point out that earnings growth has traditionally been the key driver of dividend increases. With strong earnings growth recorded last year, expectations for 2025 are even higher. Goldman projects an 11% rise in earnings per share this year, up from an estimated 8% in 2024, which is expected to drive a 7% increase in dividends, compared to a 6% rise last year. Meanwhile, Ohsung Kwon, a US equity strategist at BofA Securities, holds an even more optimistic view, forecasting a 12% dividend boost this year, supported by accelerating earnings growth.

&gt;Historically, dividends accounted for 40% of the market’s total returns from 1936 to 2012, but their contribution has dropped to just 16% over the past decade, according to a BofA Securities research note published late last year. However, Kwon expects dividends to play a more substantial role in overall market returns moving forward. In view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks according to hedge funds.

&gt;Methodology

&gt;For this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of over 1,000 hedge funds and identified the top 10 companies that pay regular dividends to shareholders and have dividend yields of at least 1%, as of February 25. This means the stocks mentioned in this list are the most popular dividend stocks among the elite hedge funds in America. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in the companies.

&gt;Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ([**see more details here**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/premium/newsletters/quarterly)).",0,0,Potential-Focus3211,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j0t0g1/johnson_johnson_jnj_among_the_top_dividend_stocks/,1j0t0g1

Currently at $26.25, Pfizer's back down to where it was at in the late 90's. It's chart looks absolutely terrible, it's 5, 10, and 20 year returns are all most all negative (depending on when you got in &amp; out), and anyone who's bought &amp; held after 2000 is likely severally in the red. 

Pfizer godawful performance is really made salient when you compare it to its competition (LLY, NVO, ABBV, JNJ). Even battle-bruised JNJ has performed better than Pfizer. 

Pfizer is the worse performing large cap drugmaker &amp; I'm curious why have they underperformed for so long? Bad management? Inferior drugs? Fraud? What would Pfizer need to do to improve their performance?

I have held this dental precision tools company stock for one year, and q4 earnings result showed a beautiful 27% YoY revenue growing, but earnings growth was a paltry under 2% growth. This, after a q3 lowered guidance. 

The other company which deserves my scorn is Kenvue, this company is guiding a -2 to +2% growth this year. This FMCG company is behaving like a Slow moving consumer Goods company that is still part of JNJ. Even slow poke Unilever and PG are doing so much better. 

I am more upset with these two companies than RDDT’s slight DAU miss.

2025-01-24 05:10:35,r/stocks,Switched from Ameriprise managed account to Fidelity - Sell individual stocks?,"After a year of trying an Ameriprise managed account, I recently moved everything to Fidelity to start managing it myself. They underperformed the S&amp;P500 (before their fee), and almost all positions are just S&amp;P500 companies anyways, so I figured if I went 100% into an S&amp;P index on my own I can't do worse.

I'm not sure how best to proceed with the current number of individual stocks. There are 64 positions total and it's unrealistic that I'll be able to keep track of the performance/trajectory of that many companies. Buffet's ""pick a few winners"" comes to mind. I've been assuming the best thing to do is to slowly liquidate the one's I don't have a specific interest in, and buy VOO/SPY in their place.

There are many companies that I like and would like to hold on to (AAPL, AMD, AMZN, BRKB, GOOGL, JNJ, KO, MSFT, NVDA, NFLX, PG). However, the majority are S&amp;P 500 companies that I don't follow closely (ABT, ADBE, AMAT, AMGN, AMT, AVGO, AZN, BA, BMY, CAT, COP, CRM, CVX, ... to name a few). It's not that I don't know those companies, but it feels ignorant to hold onto them knowing that I won't have time to monitor their performance.

Is there a best way to go about liquidating those and moving into an S&amp;P 500 index?

The stock market is a dynamic environment where prices fluctuate constantly, influenced by a multitude of factors. One valuable tool for investors is the 200-day moving average, which helps identify long-term trends and potential buying opportunities. When a company's stock price falls below its 200-day moving average, it can signal a potential undervaluation, especially if the company has strong competitive advantages and solid management.

This article examines ten publicly traded companies that meet this criteria. These companies have been selected based on their competitive strengths, management team track record, and current stock price relative to their 200-day moving average.

3. Warren Buffet's approach to stock analysis based on the two texts above
4. My own variations to this approach that have evolved over the years.

2024-12-13 02:30:05,r/ValueInvesting,"a tiny review post on three ""AI"" tools on evaluating J&amp;J ","**OBJECTIVE**: I wanted to see if what investors commonly knew about JNJ were reflected in these AI tools.

What i wrote earlier on JNJ : [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1hcx4v7/comment/m1ryzlj/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) 

My key points were:

a. people buy JNJ for dividend and safety  (Strength) 

b. JNJ is a slow growth company (Weakness) 

c.  they spun off their consumer healthcare dividend to improve profitability of the parent company (Opportunity or Catalyst) 

d.  Litigation risk of the Talcum powder issue is ongoing (Threat) 

\--------------

I then went to check JNJ against three AI tools i sometimes monitor:

[**(i) INVESTING dot com for SWOT analysis**](https://www.investing.com/news/swot-analysis/johnson--johnsons-swot-analysis-stock-poised-for-growth-amid-challenges-93CH-3766439)

On Dividends, *""*[*InvestingPro*](https://www.investing.com/pro/JNJ) *data reveals the company maintains robust profitability with a healthy gross profit margin of 69.4% and has demonstrated consistent dividend payments for 54 consecutive years.""* 

On the slow growth, *""The Innovative Medicine segment emerged as the primary growth driver, demonstrating a year-over-year underlying growth of 5.6%, excluding Covid-related impacts.*

*However, the MedTech segment experienced slower growth at 3.7%, attributed to seasonal factors and challenges in the Asia Pacific region. Analysts believe that JNJ is making significant operational progress, particularly in executing its pipeline, which supports the reiteration of positive ratings and increased price targets by several firms.""*

No mention of  Kenvue spin off masking the results or as a catalyst for future results.

Finally,  Only a one line under weakness *""Ongoing litigation risks, particularly related to talc products""*

[**(ii) BeyondSPX** ](https://beyondspx.com/quote/JNJ)

On Dividends, they mentioned this in passing: *The company's strong balance sheet and consistent cash flow generation have enabled it to invest in research and development, pursue strategic acquisitions, and reward shareholders through a steadily growing dividend.*

On the Slow growth: *For the full year 2024, Johnson &amp; Johnson has provided guidance that reflects its confidence in its business strategy and growth prospects. The company expects adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 5.7% to 6.2% with a midpoint of 6%, and reported sales growth between 5.1% to 5.6% with a midpoint of $88.6 billion. The company anticipates an adjusted pre-tax operating margin decline of approximately 200 basis points due to the addition of the V-Wave transaction. However, excluding the impact of asset acquisition accounting and related R&amp;D investment, Johnson &amp; Johnson expects to improve operating margins by 50 basis points.*

*Looking further ahead to 2025, Johnson &amp; Johnson remains confident in its ability to deliver growth in the Innovative Medicine segment, despite facing significant loss of exclusivity for some products. The company expects sales in this segment to be above the $57 billion commitment stated in 2021. In the MedTech segment, Johnson &amp; Johnson continues to target operational sales growth in the upper end of the 5% to 7% range, in line with the 2022 through 2027 weighted average market growth rate.*

No mention of the Spin off as the catalyst. 

On the talc litigation, this is what it had to say:

*.... However, net income decreased by 37.7% to $2.69 billion, primarily due to a $1.75 billion charge related to the talc litigation settlement proposal and a $1.25 billion payment to secure the global rights to the NM26 bispecific antibody.....*

*Despite its long history of success, Johnson &amp; Johnson has not been immune to challenges and controversies. The company has faced significant legal battles and product liability claims related to its talcum powder and opioid products, which have resulted in substantial financial settlements and reputational damage.*

*In response to these issues, the company has taken proactive steps to enhance its governance, strengthen its compliance processes, and prioritize a culture of transparency and accountability. Johnson &amp; Johnson has reached various settlement agreements to resolve talc-related claims and has settled the majority of opioid-related lawsuits. The company's ongoing efforts to resolve these issues demonstrate its commitment to finding responsible solutions and minimizing the impact on its stakeholders.*

The only menion was (D) Litigation risk:

*Q: Can you provide an update on the talc litigation and the next steps for resolution?*

*A: Joaquin Duato, CEO, stated that Johnson &amp; Johnson is making meaningful progress towards a comprehensive resolution of the talc litigation. Erik Haas, VP of Litigation, added that the case will remain in Texas, and the parties are working on a schedule to resolve issues by the end of the year, aiming for a confirmation hearing early next year.*

**My Conclusion:**

All three are quite good in tell me about the progress of the drugs in the pipeline, For example, Guru focus summarizes the earnings Q&amp;A, so theirs is probably the most accurate, eg. 

*""****Q****: Can you elaborate on the growth drivers for CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI in the multiple myeloma portfolio?*  
***A****: Jennifer Taubert noted CARVYKTI's strong growth due to demand and capacity expansion. TECVAYLI is seeing good uptake, and future growth is expected from combinations with other treatments. John Reed highlighted TECVAYLI's best-in-class data and potential in combination therapies.""*

Also, Gurufocus could highlight that the China business for JNJ was having challenges. *""The MedTech segment experienced headwinds in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China, affecting overall growth.""*

  
***Q****: What are the dynamics in the Asia-Pacific region, specifically China, affecting MedTech?*  
***A****: Tim Schmid explained that volume-based procurement and anti-corruption campaigns in China are impacting sales. Despite these headwinds, J&amp;J remains confident in the region's long-term growth potential, given the large patient population and strategic importance.*

  
However, i think all three are good in collecting data but they are not at the level of making inferences, like what sort of investors would want to invest in JNJ ? Growth investors, defensive investors or dividend investors? 

Among the three, BeyongSPX is the most polished for writing essays, the Gurufocus ones is great becasue it gives me only 5 Q&amp;A which is all my head can absorb scanning through the various companies, and i like [Investing.com](http://Investing.com) because i get a sense that it is edited by a human being (some details are a tad too specific)

2024-08-15 18:30:21,r/ValueInvesting,When to Sell KO (Coca-Cola) Stock and Potential New Investments ,"Hey everyone,

I've been holding KO (Coca-Cola) stock for a while now, having bought in at $64. The stock has appreciated, and I'm currently sitting on some nice profits. I'm wondering when would be a good time to close out my position? Should I wait for further gains, or is now a good time to cash in, given the market's current volatility?

Also, I have around $10,000 ready to deploy into new investments. I'm looking for some solid stock suggestions that have good potential for growth. Here’s what I’m considering:

1. **Tech Giants:** With AI and tech continuing to drive the market, I'm thinking about adding to positions in companies like Apple (AAPL) or Microsoft (MSFT). They've had strong earnings reports and seem to be well-positioned for the future.

2. **Healthcare:** Stocks like Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) or Pfizer (PFE) might offer some stability, especially with the ongoing advancements in the healthcare sector. What do you guys think about the long-term prospects of these stocks?

3. **Energy:** With the current global situation, energy stocks might be a good play. Companies like ExxonMobil (XOM) or Chevron (CVX) could benefit if oil prices rise. Any thoughts on the sustainability of these companies' dividends?

4. **Dividend Aristocrats:** Considering Coca-Cola is a dividend aristocrat, I'm also looking at other dividend-paying stocks for consistent income. Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) or PepsiCo (PEP) could be interesting additions.

Would love to hear your thoughts on whether I should hold or sell my KO stock and any other stock suggestions you have for my $10k investment. Looking forward to the discussion!

2024-08-01 20:13:46,r/stocks,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&amp;P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&amp;P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&amp;P 500 over the next 24 months.

My parents basically have been telling me it's a good stock and I shouldn't touch it, but, honestly, they're boomers and have never had to really operate in today's economy.

I'm 29 and debt free, living modestly. I don't plan on touching the money any time soon. I don't know much at all about stocks or finance.

  
Basically, I see no reason not to transfer the whole thing to index funds, just looking at charts. But I want to see if maybe there's some reason I'm unaware of to keep it all in JNJ.

Winning contracts can significantly boost a company's stability and credibility.

2023-12-16 01:19:11,r/ValueInvesting,Eyeballing the DJIA,"Hello, as an exercise I am looking through as many companies as quickly as possible. Emphasis is on _quick_ and not _detailed_. Some goals include familiarizing myself with a spectrum of companies and their rough characteristics and to get in the habit of regular analysis. To start, I've eyeballed the DJIA.

# DJIA Component Analysis

Summary:

The DJIA is priced richly, but out of its components, I think the following are
worth a closer look as far as Mega Caps are concerned:

- Apple (AAPL)
- Caterpillar (CAT)
- Chevron (CVX)
- Goldman Sachs (GS)
- Home depot (HD)
- JPMorgan Chase (JPM)
- McDonald's (MCD)
- Microsoft (MS)
- UnitedHealth Group (UNH)
- Visa (V)

## 3M (MMM)
- High dividend yield 6%
- Revenue and earnings are stable
- Trading around a reasonable 10 PE
- Meh return on assets 7.67%
- High debt to equity 357%
- Meh current ratio 1.05
- Stable capex
- Mostly stable FCF
- Strong profit margin ~40%

The high debt to equity plus mediocre return on assets is a red flag. Chemical
companies are known to need large amounts of capital outlay on R&amp;D and new
products though. The strong profit margin could indicate competitive advantage.

## American Express (AXP)
- Elevated PE ratio 16.34
- Earnings the last 4 years not smooth
- Revenues growing after a sharp loss in 2020
- Good profit margin 14.7%
- Poor return on assets 3.4%
- High debt to equity 176%
- Good current ratio 1.63
- Stable capex
- FCF looks to be trending up

It's priced for growth and I'd need to look at the 10 year chart to see if it
checks out. The poor return on assets and high debt to equity ratio is notable,
but I wouldn't be surprised if it's acceptable as a quirk to this specific line
of business.

## Amgen (AMGN)
- Elevated PE ratio 19.35
- Stable revenues last 4 years
- Earnings trending down
- High profit margin 28.2%
- Meh return on assets 7.86%
- Extremely high debt to equity 789%
- Great current ratio 2.86
- Capex trending up
- Steady FCF
- Issued a lot of debt in 2023 and got a lot of cash

It's priced for growth but the historical data doesn't pan out for it. 
Pharmaceutical companies need large amounts of capital outlay for R&amp;D and new
products but the extremely high debt to equity is concerning.

## Apple (AAPL)
- High PE ratio
- Revenue and earnings has grown last 4 years
- High profit margin 25%
- High return on assets 20%
- High debt to equity 199%
- Meh current ratio 0.99
- Capex trending up
- FCF trending up
- Stable cash position

It's priced for growth but the historical data might actually justify it.
High profit margin, high return on assets both look great. It's definitely a 
good idea to look at ten years of earnings and investigate whether growth can
hold.

## Boeing (BA)
- Negative PE
- Negative earnings for past 4 years
- Negative profit margin -3.7%
- Tiny return on assets 0.46%
- Meh current ratio 1.15
- Capex kind of stable but uneven
- Negative FCF 2019-2021, now positive
- Cash position even but bouncy

Money loser, easy pass. Ten years earnings may be worth looking at, maybe it has
cyclical properties.

## Caterpillar (CAT)
- Somewhat reasonable PE ratio 14.4
- Stable earnings last 4 years
- Revenues somewhat growing
- Good profit margin 13.6%
- Good return on assets 10%
- High debt to equity 181%
- Ok current ratio 1.45
- Stable capex
- FCF trending up

This looks pretty decent actually.

## Chevron (CVX)
- Reasonable PE ratio 10.5
- Earnings have grown the last 4 years but the 10 year should be checked.
- Mediocre return on assets 7.4%
- Low debt to equity 12.37%
- Ok current ratio 1.25
- Capex even but bouncy
- FCF trending up
- Meh profit margin 12.5%

This looks a little interesting. It's unusually unlevered and the price looks
ok.

## Cisco (CSCO)
- Somewhat ok PE ratio 14.4
- Revenue and earnings have steadily grown the last 4 years
- Ok/good return on assets 10.7%
- Low debt to equity 19%
- Good current ratio 1.5
- Stable cash position
- Increasing capex
- FCF trending up
- Good profit margin 23.4%

This looks pretty ok but some growth is built into the PE ratio. Take a look at
the 10 year earnings to make sure things check out.

## Coca-Cola (KO)
- High PE ratio 23.7
- Growing revenue and earnings last 4 years
- Ok return on assets 8.5%
- Elevated debt to equity 150%
- Meh current ratio 1.14
- Increasing cash position
- Fairly stable capex that trends slightly up
- FCF trending up
- Good profit margin 23.9%

It's priced for growth and looking at the return on assets, I'm not so sure
they can live up to it. It's worth looking at the 10 year earnings.

## Disney (DIS)
- Insanely high PE ratio 70!
- Profit way down from 2019, what happened?
- Revenue growth in 2022
- Low return on assets 2.8%
- Low debt to equity 44%
- Meh current ratio 1.05
- Stable cash position
- Stable capex
- Unstable FCF, it's growing maybe?
- Low profit margin 2.65%

It looks like its earning dropped off a cliff from 2019 and it's priced like it
is still making that much money. It's possible they're heavily reinvesting but
I wouldn't count on it.

## Dow (DOW)
- High PE ratio 27
- Inconsistent earnings the last 4 years
- Revenue increasing the last 2 years
- Pretty decent price to book 1.82
- Low return on assets 3%
- Good current ratio 1.79
- Good debt to equity 82%
- Fairly stable cash position
- Stable but growing capex
- Fairly stable and growing FCF
- Low profit margin 2.85%

Last year was the second best earnings they had out of 4 years and the PE ratio
is still high. Book value and debt looks good, they're not going anywhere. The
return on assets is awful though. 

## Goldman Sachs (GS)
- High/moderate PE ratio 16.5
- Earnings trending higher with abnormal spike in 2021
- High profit margin 17%
- Low return on assets 0.5%
- High debt to equity 548%
- Good current ratio 1.64
- Cash position nearly doubled between 2020 and 2021
- Capex trending down
- Uneven FCF, dipping into the red
- Ok/good profit margin 17.76%

Earnings growth the last four years could justify the PE ratio. A view of the
10 year earnings and the business is prudent. The high debt to equity may just
be the nature of the business but I don't really know.

## Home Depot (HD)
- High PE ratio 20.9
- Both earnings and revenues consistently grown the last four years.
- High return on assets 18%
- Insane debt to equity 3444% (?!), that can't be right
- Good current ratio 1.3
- Mostly stable cash position
- Stable capex
- Uneven but stable FCF
- Meh profit margin 10.22%

Earnings growth the last four years could justify the PE, the 10 year earnings
should be looked at. Amazing return on assets. The debt to equity is insane and
I don't trust the number given by Yahoo Finance.

## Honeywell (HON)
- High PE ratio 24
- Revenue and earnings both look kind of stable
- Meh return on assets 7.7%
- Okish debt to equity 119%
- Good current ratio 1.35
- Stable cash position
- Stable capex
- Decreasing FCF
- Meh profit margin 14.87%

It's priced for growth but I don't see much/any growth on the 4 year earnings.
It may be worth looking at the 10 year earnings.

## IBM (IBM)
- High PE ratio 21
- Stable revenue
- Strongly decreasing earnings
- Poor return on assets 4.55%
- High debt to equity 252%
- Poor current ratio 0.9
- Uneven cash position, trending lower
- Decreasing capex
- Decreasing FCF
- Meh profit margin 11.32%

It's priced for growth but seems to be shrinking.

## Intel (INTC)
- PE ratio N/A (23ish based on 2022 earnings)
- Revenue looks to be heading lower
- Earnings trending lower
- Negative return on assets -0.72%
- Low debt to equity 46%
- Good current ratio 1.53
- Growing cash position
- Growing capex
- FCF trending down strongly into the red
- Negative profit margin -3% (?)

It's priced to historic earnings but it is yet to be seen whether they can
return to those times. In the meantime, they're spending greatly on capex.
It may payoff at a later date.

## Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)
- High PE ratio 29
- Revenues seem to be increasing, spikes from 2021 to 2022 into 2023
- Earnings also spike from 2021 to 2022 into 2023
- High profit margin 35%
- Ok return on assets 10%
- Low debt to equity 42%
- Ok/good current ratio 1.21
- Fairly stable cash position
- Increasing capex
- FCF trending down
- High profit margin 35% (!)

It's priced for high growth. While metrics look fine, they seem to be more of
a stalwart than a grower and it is doubtful they can grow to expectations.

## JPMorgan Chase (JPM)
- Reasonable PE ratio 9.6
- Revenues and earnings both bouncy  
- Low return on assets 1.34%
- Return on equity 17%
- Debt to equity N/A
- Current ratio N/A
- Bouncy cash position
- Bouncy FCF
- High profit margin 36% (!)
  
I don't think I can adequately evaluate banks at a glance. At the very least, 
the PE ratio looks good and could merit further investigation.

## McDonald's (MCD)

- High PE ratio 25
- Bouncy revenues and earnings
- High profit margin 33%
- Good return on assets 14.3%
- Debt to equity N/A
- Good current ratio 1.71
- Bouncy cash position
- Stableish capex
- Bouncy FCF
- High profit margin 33% (!)

It's priced high but has good return on assets. It's worth taking a second look
with the 10+ earnings history.

## Merck (MRK)
- Really high PE ratio 58(!)
- Revenue has had consistent growth the last 4 years
- Earnings trending up but a bit lumpy
- Weak return on assets 5.4%
- Good debt to equity 84%
- Ok/good current ratio 1.38
- Fairly stable cash position
- Stable capex
- FCF trending up quickly
- Low profit margin 7.7%
  
Why is this priced insanely high? The FCF has a really high trajectory which is
also strange. The weirdness is worth a second look but the high PE ratio means
that even if you did look, you still won't find something worth buying.

## Microsoft (MSFT)
- High PE ratio 36
- Revenue and earnings both consistently growing strongly the last 3 years
- Good return on assets 14.5%
- Low debt to equity 48%
- Good current ratio 1.66
- Growing cash position
- Growing FCF
- High profit margin 35% (!)

It's priced high but might actually be growing enough to justify it.

## Nike (NKE)
- High PE ratio 37
- Consistent revenue growth
- Fairly consistent earnings
- Meh return on assets 9.35%
- Ok debt to equity 87%
- Strong current ratio 2.87
- Stable cash position
- Stable capex
- Fairly consistent FCF
- Low profit margin 9.8%
  
Metrics are pretty good but it's doubtful they're worth the high PE ratio.

## Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)

- High PE ratio 24
- Stable, small revenue growth
- Stable, small earnings growth
- Ok return on assets 10.4%
- Good debt to equity 74%
- Bad current ratio 0.67(?)
- Stable cash position
- Stable capex
- Stable FCF
- Ok profit margin 18%
  
It's priced as a growth stock but looks like a stalwart. The current
ratio looks bad but it's likely a nothingburger.

## Salesforce (CRM)
- Insane PE ratio 98 (!!)
- Good, strong, consistent revenue growth
- Lumpy earnings
- Bad return on assets 3.68%
- Good debt to equity 23%
- Meh current ratio 1.04
- Stable cash position
- Growing capex
- Fast growing FCF
- Low profit margin 7.6%

Metrics look pretty good. It's clearly a growth stock but it's already
priced for hyper growth.

## Travelers (TRV)
- High PE 20
- Growing revenue
- Stable earnings
- Low profit margin 5.4%
- Low return on assets 1.43%
- Good debt to equity 40%
- Poor current ratio 0.33 (!?)
- Stable cash position
- Stable FCF
- Increasing SGA
  
The PE is high and there are some weak metrics.

## UnitedHealth Group (UNH)
- High PE 23
- Growing revenue
- Growing earnings
- Low profit margin 6%
- Low return on assets 7.5%
- Low debt to equity 67%
- Increasing cash position
- Increasing capex
- Increasing FCF

It's a growing stalwart. 

## Verizon (VZ)
- Low PE 7.5
- Stable revenues
- Stable earnings
- Ok profit margin 15.5%
- Low return on assets 5%
- High debt to equity 180%
- Low current ratio 0.69 (!)
- Stable capex
- FCF mostly stable but a little lumpy
  
Metrics are a little mixed here.

## Visa (V)

- High PE 31
- Growing revenues
- Growing earnings
- High profit margin 53% (!)
- Good return on assets 15.5%
- Good debt to equity 55%
- Good current ratio 1.45
- Stable cash position
- Growing capex
- Increasing SGA
- Growing FCF

The metrics are good and the price reflects this.

## Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)
- PE N/A
- High dividend yield 7.64%
- Stable revenues
- Earnings grew until 2023 where it bombed into deep negative
- Negative profit margin -2.21%
- Low return on assets 1.48%
- Ok debt to equity 121%
- Low current ratio 0.63 (!)
- Growing SGA
- Cash position decreasing
- Capex increasing
- FCF decreasing

The metrics look concerning.

## Walmart (WMT)
- PE 25
- Growing revenues
- Stable earnings
- Low profit margin 2.55%
- Low return on assets 6.44%
- Good debt to equity 83%
- Low current ratio 0.85 (?)
- SGA mildly trending up
- Stable cash position
- Growing capex
- Stable FCF

The metrics don't look spectacular.",13,3,livingdeadghost,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/18jehl6/eyeballing_the_djia/,18jehl6
2023-12-04 11:36:01,r/stocks,US Citizen Trying to Avoid PFIC,"Hi All,

As the title suggests, I am trying to avoid breaching the PFIC regulation while continuing to invest. Once tax season rolls around I normally max out my Roth IRA, however I am not in a sticky situation where all my earned income in the past year has been made outside the US. Hence, I will most likely be opting for the FTC, so that I can contribute to my Roth IRA.

Unfortunately due to EU and US regulations I am now in a sort of investing purgatory where I cant invest in ETFs/mutual funds in either market without being in tax paperwork hell. So I am now looking at buying individual stocks, but I am a noob and am looking for advice. I would like to purchase stock that is more on the safe side and acts like the S&amp;P500. I am not really looking for dividends, at the moment I am more so in a ""set it and forget it"" mindset.   


So perhaps another way to phrase my question is, **what would you invest in if you wanted to invest in index funds, but were not allowed to?** I will of course do the leg work to figure out what sort of maintenance I need to perform on the stocks (i.e. how often do I need to login and check on my stocks, when do I rearrange my stock allocations). If anyone has links for videos/docs on how to maintain stocks that were particularly helpful to them, that would also be dope.

Some opinions/options I have found through reading reddit include:

* Utility companies
* Chips (e.g. Nvidia)
* Insurance companies (e.g. Allianz)
* Boring services we will almost always need (e.g. Waste Management WM)
* Huge Pharma (e.g. JNJ, Pfizer, P&amp;G)
* Food (e.g. KO, Pepsi, General Mills, Costco)
* Green tech I am weary of, ive read that the renewable sector is stull in flux, companies are not yet stable

A friendly request ... please don't roast me, I am not the most financially savvy person, I am just trying to prepare for retirement and keep my money safe from inflation in a responsible way. If I wrote something that sounds stupid or doesn't make sense, please teach me so I understand ""the way"". Thanks in advance for your help.",11,7,Worldly_Assistant746,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18ahi8t/us_citizen_trying_to_avoid_pfic/,18ahi8t

2023-11-12 04:09:55,r/stocks,"Stocks with good dividends without debt drag, a prep for recession &amp; USA bond problems","Hello, in a world of debt with a probable 'recession by design' coming,  
I have some parameters of low-debt consumer staples and some defensive names.  
  These are what I am most interested in now.  This is due to   
\*- declining USA consumer confidence  
\*- Bankruptcy of property development majors in China  
\*- the fastest rise in interest rates in decades  
\*- The end of student loan payment respite  
\*- The continuation of the end of eviction protections (yes those were still in  
place this year in some liberal states !)  
\*- The 150,000 jobs added recently was not bad, but it is a declining trend  
\*- The debt ceiling debacle returns in December  
  
  When a company stares down the barrel of rising interest rates and they  
want to take on more debt to work on a project like a new product, the situation  
is much worse of the company already has a lot of debt.  So being in a state of  
low debt gives more growth potential in addition to the obvious safer situation.  
  Comsumer staples stocks do well when people become convinced that a recession  
is coming, and during the recession they tend to stay stable.   
 Then you sell these stocks when layoffs start to decline as you are well into the recession itself.  
 There are some industries that carry more debt than most.  These are the  
ones who consider their revenue streams predictable and reliable.  They can  
take on debt and be confident that they will be able to meet the financing payments.  
Consumer staples fall into this category, as do utilities.  
  Cyclical industries such as semiconductor capital equipment are ill-advised to  
take on a lot of debt.  
  
  Numerous consumer staples stocks have debt to equity higher than 100%.  
Surprised?  I still grapple with the fact that Circuit City went under with only  
25% debt to equity reported, and yet many companies trudge on for years with debt  
to equity higher than 100%.  I highlight ones I found that according to Reuters  
have less debt than that.  I will perhaps stretch perception of what 'low debt'  
means and call this &lt;100% = low debt (at least it is in consumer staples land).  
Sometimes you see web sites with financial metrics put a '0' for debt, but often  
that is wrong.  It is better to see a small non-zero number for debt to equity.  
Naturally to be worth investing in it we would like to see a non trivial dividend.  
  
Here is the list, with valuation metrics as of 11/11 thrown in:  
'Back PE' refers to 'Backward looking PE' as opposed to forecasted PE  
pr/sls refers to price to sales.  Theorists argue this is the most important value metric.  
I can endeavor to follow up with debt to EBITDA.  EBITDA is 'earnings before interest, taxes,  
depreciation, and amortization'.  This is another important measure of debt.  
The two measures of debt total and long term I separate with double slash  
and it does not mean division.  
  A main motivation here is that if you truly believe (as I do) that USA bonds have  
transitioned to something one should refuse to own at any yield, then these stocks are  
one of the best options left to be a store of value in the future.

2023-10-26 04:18:42,r/ValueInvesting,TSVT's market cap is below the cash it has on its balance sheet,"TSVT's market cap dropped to $178million today. It had $96million in cash and $187million in marketable securities at the end of Q2 (June 30). At projected cash burn of $70million/quarter, it should have as of today approximately as much cash as it's market cap. It has no debt, and shareholder equity is at $367million.

TSVT has a 50/50 profit sharing agreement with BMY for the gene therapy Abecma, which is the fifth line treatment for multiple myeloma. This sells for $481,000/patient, and there are 36,000 new patients per year in the USA, of which 12,000 per year die. TSVT has a FDA application in the review process to raise the treatment to the third line with decision deadline in December, and a phase 3 clinical trial in the pipeline for second line / front line treatment. When the FDA approves third line (very likely), it would triple the targetable market, and I would put the 20 year discounted cash flow valuation of the company at around $2billion (&gt;10x of market cap today).

There are 3 risks for TSVT: 1) There is a competing treatment by JNJ/LEGN called Carvykti, which has shown better results in the phase 3 clinical trials, but it's too early to say which treatment will perform better in the larger population. 2) Currently both treatments are bottlenecked on the production capacity. This is not expected to increase significantly before 2025, and it is doubtful as to how TSVT will raise enough cash to survive the next 18months. 3) Lots of people are shorting TSVT, probably on the cashflow risk mentioned above? It could also be because funds want to load up on it at a lower price, institutional ownership has increased from ~80% to ~90%. I don't really know why.

I believe TSVT is a pretty good bet that has a decent chance at 10x in the next two years, or even 2x in the next 2 months. I bought some today at $3.51. I think I would buy some more if it drops another 20%. Then probably some more if it drops to $2.50. Anything below that I would think somebody out there knows a lot more than I do and it's about to go bankrupt so I'd take a L and wait it out.

I decided to post here because I'm anxious, scared, and excited at the same time because I finally saved up some money and invested it for the first time.  I quit drinking beer and buying useless crap, and saved up (don't laugh) $1,000 dollars and had it sitting there in a credit union with pennies for interest and I didn't like that.  

I'm really kicking myself for not doing this when I was younger.  I remember when I was in my mid 20's ""this close"" to making a brokerage account and getting started, and I never did it.  Did this scare any of you the first time you got in to trading?  

The first share I bought was 1 full share in the Vanguard VGT ETF.  I know it sounds dumb, but it was pretty scary and exciting at the same time.  My position is focusing 80% ETFs and sprinkle in some individual stocks to play around with.  

My primary goal is dividends and compound reinvesting, in the hopes that I can have a nice-ish passive income 20-30 years from now.  I'm wondering what you guys think of my current positions:

**ETFs:** VGT, VONG, VTI, SCHD, and SCHG

**Stocks** *(I bought fractions of these)*:  AAPL, AMZN, HD, JNJ, KO, MSFT, NVDA, O, RTX, WM, WMT

2023-10-04 03:46:43,r/stocks,Response to falling bonds: low debt stocks that are recession friendly,"With bond yields rising, a company that has high debt has a significant earnings drag.  Rising yields makes new borrowing expensive and kills growth, even when you are diligently releasing new products and retiring old unpopular ones.  Also bond yields rising pushes us toward recession, whether we actually get to recession naturally I don't know, but consumer staples put you in a prepared spot for it.

The following is a list of low debt consumer staples names with competitive dividends.  Throwing in PFE because it is recession friendly even if not a consumer staple name.

PFE, KHC, TSN, HRL

somewhat less competitive dividend 2% &lt; Div &lt; 3%   but still low debt

JNJ, BG, MDLZ, ADM

Some good consumer staples names with good dividends that have more debt

K, GIS, CPB, REYN, CAG, CPB    among these six names CAG has the lowest debt to equity

Other stocks with high dividends but also higher debt but not amongst the highest I found

Past suggestions that are in the backlog include:

* Price targets
* Historical share count chart
* % funds allocated to RND
* A chart that compares the stock price with a historical fundamental of choice
* Insider trading, % of stock allocated in indexes and mutual funds

According to the DOW newswire - 

Then, J&amp;J dropped a bombshell. It still holds around 90% of Kenvue shares, and it had said previously that it plans to dispose of the rest in one of two ways: either through a spinoff, where J&amp;J shareholders receive distributions of Kenvue stock, or a split-off, whereby J&amp;J shareholders could choose to exchange their shares for Kenvue ones.  
On Thursday, J&amp;J Chief Financial Officer  Joseph Wolk  said the company would opt for the latter split-off option, and that ""the launch of the tender could occur as early as the coming days.""",15,9,imasysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/154xfdy/jnj_spinoff_outcome/,154xfdy

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Tuesday morning, boosted by an important round of first-quarter earnings results that topped Wall Street expectations and suggested companies are faring better than feared in this tough economic environment.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained 65 points, or 0.2%, while S&amp;P 500 futures were 0.4% higher. Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.6%. The moves came after the major averages gained to kick off a stacked week of corporate earnings.
*****
&gt; Bank of America added about 3% before the bell after surpassing first-quarter expectations on the top and bottom lines as rates rose. Johnson &amp; Johnson’s results topped estimates and the drug and raised its 2023 guidance, lifting the Dow member nearly 2% in premarket trading. Netflix weighs in after the market close.
*****
&gt; Some of Tuesday’s bullish sentiment was dented after Goldman Sachs reported lighter-than-expected first-quarter revenue.
*****
&gt; In global economic news, China GDP rose at a 4.5% pace in the first quarter the highest level in a year and more than the 4% estimate.
*****
&gt; Stocks finished higher during Monday’s regular trading session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 100.71 points, or 0.3%. The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.33%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.28%.
*****
&gt; While earnings results so far have proved resilient, traders are on the lookout for insight into how companies are holding up amid a period of persistent inflation and rising interest rates, paying close attention to financials after dual bank failures last month sent shockwaves across the sector.
*****
&gt; “There’s been a lot of pessimism about the economic outlook, about the financial outlook, since the beginning of last year,” Yardeni Research’s Ed Yardeni said Monday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
&gt; “I have said that I think we’re in a recession. We’ve been in a recession since last year. But it’s a rolling recession, and it keeps rolling in different industries, and all in all, it isn’t adding up to an economywide recession,” Yardeni added.
*****
&gt; On the economic front, traders are watching for the latest housing starts and building permits data. March housing starts are expected to fall 3.4% to 1.40 million units, according to consensus estimates from Dow Jones.
*****
&gt; March building permits data is forecasted to drop 4.9% to 1.45 million units, according to economists polled by Dow Jones.

# [Stock futures are flat after Dow, S&amp;P 500 snap four-day win streaks: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/04/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were lower on Wednesday as traders assess the state of the global economy following a losing session.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 15 points, or less than 0.1%, while S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures were also down less than 0.1% each.
*****
&gt; Johnson &amp; Johnson shares rose nearly 3% in premarket trading after the pharmaceutical company said Tuesday it would pay $8.9 billion over the next 25 years to settle claims that its talc products caused cancer.
*****
&gt; Wednesday’s moves come as concern over higher rates simmered once again. New Zealand’s central bank overnight hiked rates by 50 basis points, noting that inflation was “too high and persistent.”
*****
&gt; On Tuesday, the Dow shed nearly 200 points, snapping a four-day win streak as broader economic concerns weighed on equities. The S&amp;P 500 fell by 0.58%, also snapping a string of four consecutive winning sessions. The Nasdaq Composite dropped by 0.52%.
*****
&gt; Investors digested the latest job openings report that suggested the Federal Reserve’s efforts to cool the labor market might finally be having an effect. In February, the number of available positions fell below 10 million for the first time in nearly two years.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, the energy market added to uncertainty this week after OPEC+ said it would cut output by 1.16 million barrels of oil per day.
*****
&gt; “I think it’s some consolidation after a stellar rally that we had last week,” Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital, said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
&gt; “But that still doesn’t deter me from saying that I think we can have a more positive tone to April because if you look at the broader picture, we sort of have the recipe for a soft landing, which is inflation expectations are coming down. And broadly speaking, economic data is surprising to the upside. So that actually still supports a resilient stock market,” Amoroso added.
*****
&gt; On Wednesday, traders are expecting the latest ADP private payrolls report before the bell. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting a rise of 210,000 jobs in March, down from an increase of 242,000 in the previous month.
*****
&gt; The latest reading of the ISM Services Index is also set to release. Economists are forecasting a reading of 54.3, according to Dow Jones consensus estimates. That’s down slightly from 55.1 in the previous release.

2023-02-19 08:37:14,r/stocks,UFPT- UFP Technologies company discussion,"Who are they:

UFP is a custom packaging and component manufacturer. They make single use packaging and parts that are included in a wide variety of products. Padding that goes inside a helmet? UFP. Gaskets that go into cars? UFP. The stuff that keeps your electronics padded during shipping? UFP. Most importantly for the business, the single use medical device packaging is made by UFP. They actually have a wide variety of products that go into a variety of applications across all industries. It's a little hard to describe since they make so many different things, but their website has a lot of information.

The company is based in Newburyport, MA and has a market cap of $878 million. They currently have a 17% ROE and gross margins around 25%. They have a net cash position (more cash than debt).

&amp;#x200B;

Management

UFP has an experienced management team. The CEO, Jeffrey Bailly, has been in the position since 1995, and has also been chairman since 2006. Numerous other executives have been with the company for 15 years or more. Under their management, the stock has done very well. I would describe this as an experienced and proven management team.

&amp;#x200B;

Growth drivers and moat

I'd rate the company as having a narrow moat. Most of their designs are custom creations that meet the specifications laid out by their customer. Because of this, they are involved in the design process with their clients. As a result, it would be costly for their customers to seek out a new packaging manufacturer as they would need to completely restart their design process and establish a new relationship. Since packaging makes up a relatively small expense in the process, it isn't really cost effective to constantly change packaging providers. At the same time, it is not easy to break into the industry as there are high upfront costs and a lot technical know how to effectively compete in the industry. It is also an industry that requires a reputation for quality, since device makers want to not lose sleep over something like packaging. 

The largest and fastest growing division of UFP is their medical packaging unit. It currently provides about 85% of revenue, and increasing. They are in the process of building new manufacturing facilities in Mexico and the Dominican Republic. This will help them lower production costs, and expand their products internationally.

UFP also has a history of bolt on acquisitions. The packaging industry has a lot of smaller players and there is a long runway should they wish to continue to utilize this strategy.

This strategy has resulted in a 5 year CAGR in the earnings of 13%. This includes 2020, which was a very bad year for medical devices. 

&amp;#x200B;

Risks

Medical packaging is a zero failure industry. Failure of their products could potentially lead to financial liability, and harm to patients. UFP acknowledges this in their 10K. It is always an issue in this field, but so far UFP has not had major problems.

They also state customer concentration as a potential risk. As of last 10K, they get 34% of revenue from their top ten customers. However, no individual company makes up more than 10% of revenue. In my opinion, this is the nature of medical devices. There are a few big companies that dominate the market (JNJ, SYK, MDT, etc.) and lots of smaller players.

They do list other risks in the 10K, but those were the ones that jumped out at me as being particular to this company. I also question how long their growth story can continue. If they keep it going, this could have a long runway in a fractured market. If not, this could descend into mediocrity.

&amp;#x200B;

Final thoughts

This company and stock have had a phenomenal run, yet still have a market cap less than $1 billion. It is trading in line with its historic multiples, and in my opinion is fairly valued. I do not own shares in this company, but would potentially be interested. It has had an amazing rally in the last few months, and could potentially be due for a pullback. 

For the first 9 months of this fiscal year (They report full year earnings in March) the company has already made $4.41/share(per the last 10Q). This puts them on track to earn $5.88-$6 per share this year, giving them a 18x multiple. That would be low for the company, and also low for a growing medical company.",14,10,creemeeseason,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1164lng/ufpt_ufp_technologies_company_discussion/,1164lng

# [Stock futures dip after back-to-back gains on Wall Street](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/23/stock-market-news-live-updates-futures-open-to-close.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures dipped slightly Tuesday as investors struggled to continue a strong start to the week during a busy stretch of corporate earnings.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 100 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures slipped 0.3%, and Nasdaq-100 futures pulled back by 0.4%.
*****
&gt; The moves in futures comes after a solid start to the week on Wall Street. On Monday, the Nasdaq Composite led with a gain of 2.01%. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow added 1.19% and 0.76%, respectively. It was the second straight positive day for the major averages, and all three are up in 2023.
*****
&gt; The gains have come despite an underwhelming start to earnings season and more signs that the U.S. economy is slowing, with some expected the rally to level off.
*****
&gt; “We do not see much scope for markets to rally in the near term, especially given our outlook for continued pressure on corporate profit growth,” wrote Mark Haefele, chief investment office at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a Tuesday note to clients.
*****
&gt; That’s in part because Monday’s close levels sits above the firm’s respective June and December price targets for the S&amp;P of 3,700 and 4,000.
*****
&gt; Earnings season continues Tuesday with results from software giant Microsoft after the bell.

2023-01-03 15:54:57,r/stocks,Financial Metrics of over 8000 Stocks Compiled," As a dividend-growth investor, I'm always looking for better ways to evaluate the investment quality of a stock individually as well as part of my broader portfolio. In the very beginning I used to heavily invest in stocks that were Dividend Aristocrats. But I started asking questions such as, how are these stocks performing compared to their peers. Are there stocks with better performing ROEs? What level of risk (Sharpe ratio) was taken to achieve those earnings? What is the forecasted earnings growth over the next 5 years? How many consecutive years have they increased dividends? What's their payout ratio? What are analysts thinking? Are there sectors/industries I'm overinvested or underinvested in?

So I decided to write some programs to pull free financial data from multiple sources. I consolidate all of these different data sources, cleanse and standardize the data, and came up with my own scoring metric on how to rank each stock. It does lean more towards small cap stocks which I typically avoid, but it's still informative to know what ranks high. The metrics I use for calculating my score include metrics such as Current Dividend Yield, 5-yr Forecasted Earnings Growth, ROE, Payout Ratio, Sharpe Ratio, Piotroski F Score, Dividend List Membership (Aristocrats, Champions, Kings, etc.) and it favors stocks with strong histories of paying quality dividends. I try not to give any one metric too much weight.

Pasted below is a link to a GoogleSheets spreadsheet that has the entire list. Hopefully you can use the data to make more informed investing decisions.

What are your thoughts on my top rankings? Any surprises? Any questions on any particular metric? Hopefully it has provided you with extra investment insight. I'm always looking for ways to refine my methodology and scoring, so any suggestions would be appreciated.

2022-12-30 18:24:48,r/ValueInvesting,Looking back on Previous Valuations," Dear Value Investing subreddit members, 

I hope this message finds you well. I recently returned to this subreddit after taking some time away to focus on my new job as an analyst. As I looked back on my previous posts, I wanted to see how accurately I was able to predict the value of certain companies. After reviewing my recommendations, I believe I did a satisfactory job utilizing various valuation methods, including DCF, DDM, and relative valuations, to determine the intrinsic value of the companies in question. I would appreciate your honest feedback on my reports, which are attached below. If there is interest, I would be happy to continue providing similar reports on this subreddit, either as a one-time service or on a recurring basis. If you are interested, please feel free to reach out to me directly and we can talk about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Sincerely, 

Endured Markets

2022-12-08 19:39:22,r/stocks,The bottom is in. Just keep dcaing into indexes and in 20 years you'll have a lot more money.. Easy,"The bottom is always in when your outlook is 20 years from now my friends!

The best way to make money long term is to keep buying in small amounts each week into and index.

Ignore Cnbc! They're in business to keep people watching. Yes, you can learn some things and get a general market sense, etc,but take everything you hear with a grain of salt!

Remember that the people they have on are usually trying to pump their own stocks or get you to go along with their investing thesis,not to help YOU, but to make money for themselves. That's just my opinion.

Anyways I have about 20 good companies that I average down in but I'm slowly coming around to the idea of indexing a larger portion and just dcaing.

Some indexes I like are VTI QQQ QTEC IGV XLV IBB.

Then I have mostly blue chips like UNH MSFT AAPL GOOGL NVDA LIN UNP COST ASML LRCX etc.

But I think for the average investor with a 10 to 20 year look out, the ""bottom"" is NOW.

I mean by that that when you look back 5, 10 and 20 years from now most indexes and good companies will be a ""bottom"" compared to where they'll be in those.time frames.

So for the average investor seriously you're best bet to be successful long term is to pick an index or two, not a sector, but a broad index or two like say VTI and QQQ and just do a 50/50 weekly.

For example if you inest $100 A week, just put $50 into VTI  and QQQ each week and get on with life. You're not concerned with what happens next week, next month etc. You just keep buying!

So if you throw $50 into QQQ and it's  ""crashes"" 50% next week .... awesome!!! THATS A BUYING OPPORTUNITY!!

Always keep positive and have a positive outlook on life. Keep yourself fit and as healthy as possible and don't eat a lot of junk. Try to eat as little as you can. That's what I do now. I fast every day for at least 12 hours.

So keep buying into indexes. If you want to mess with individual  stocks I think you should keep it to about 20% of your portfolio  and maybe under 20 positions.

I also like to keep at least 30% cash right now, but maybe I should have more of that cash in low risk stocks like JNJ etc.

Anyways good luck all and remember that if you're under 40 you should just keep buying on autopilot into VTI or whatever. Don't woŕy about seeing RED in your portfolio.  You aren't concerned with what happens short term and RED means you now can buy either your index or favorite stocks for cheaper!!",0,0,apooroldinvestor,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zg7c4g/the_bottom_is_in_just_keep_dcaing_into_indexes/,zg7c4g

# [S&amp;P 500 futures are flat as Wall Street awaits Powell speech on economy](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/29/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures were flat on Wednesday as Wall Street awaits an afternoon speech on the economy from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.
*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures were essentially little changed, with the benchmark looking to snap a 3-day losing streak. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 18 points. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.1%.
*****
&gt; Traders were hit with two reports Wednesday morning that caused volatility in stock futures. On one hand, a labor report signaled the job market could be cooling, raising hopes the Federal Reserve would slow its aggressive rate-hiking campaign. On the other hand, an updated reading of third-quarter gross domestic product was released and it showed the economy was stronger last period than first realized.
*****
&gt; Payroll processing firm ADP said Wednesday that private companies added just 127,000 positions for the month, well below the 190,000 consensus estimate from economists polled by Dow Jones.
*****
&gt; But the Bureau of Economic Analysis also said Wednesday that third-quarter GDP increased at a 2.9% annual rate, according to its second estimate. That was revised higher from the 2.6% first estimate.
*****
&gt; Powell will give a speech at the Brookings Institution this afternoon that may give further insight into the central bank’s thinking on future interest rate increases. The Fed is slated to meet later this month and is largely expected to deliver a smaller 0.5 percentage point rate hike after four consecutive 0.75 percentage point increases to tame high inflation. Any signal of a pivot on future rate hikes would likely send markets higher.
*****
&gt; “This is a Fed-made recession, so eventually when he does pivot, the market should move higher pretty quickly,” said Steve Grasso, CEO of Grasso Global, on CNBC’s “Fast Money” Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a mixed session. The Nasdaq Composite shed 0.59% and the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.16%, marking the third straight negative day for each. The Dow Jones Industrial Average notched a marginal gain, closing 3.07 points, or 0.01%, higher.
*****
&gt; Stocks have been weighed down by China’s zero-Covid policy and have failed to fully recover from losses even as the country announced steps toward reopening, such as an uptick in vaccination rates for the elderly.

2022-11-06 09:32:35,r/ValueInvesting,"How to know if passive investing works long term when more and more people are doing it, is it not self fulfilling prophecy?","So I know there is plenty of research that index investing worked for over 100 years. But now I realized that first index fund started in 1975, in emerging markets 1987. The prior research was done when nobody invested in index fund. Hardly anyone invested in index funds in 80s.

The new resereach which has been done over last 30 years could be flawed, because passive investors increased from almost 0 % to almost 50 % ( https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/passive-likely-overtakes-active-by-2026-earlier-if-bear-market/ ). Ofc you are gonna underperform the market, if more and more people are ""blindly"" buying the same stocks and you buy different stocks.

If index funds are making the market inefficient, there could be opportunites for active funds. However, reaching for these opportunities would also mean to underperform market in the short term - or even medium term (at least for the duration for which the passive investors are increasing)... which seems like a nightmare for majority of active funds. They are more inclined to just grab some pricey stocks like JNJ,MCD,WMT, for they are highly included in indexes and their prices are pushed further and further.

And if we conclude that the market is still efficient, when will it stop? What about when the number of passive investors rise to 80 %? Or 95 %?

I was thinking whether to give up on stock picking and focus more on my work, but I am terrified by the growing number of passive investors. Every no-brainer (blind) investment fails given the sufficient time, because everyone is going to do it.

&gt; Stock futures rose Tuesday morning after the Nasdaq Composite posted its best daily performance since July.

&gt; Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 2.13%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 506 points or 1.67% and S&amp;P 500 futures jumped 1.88%.
*****
&gt; Strong earnings results on Tuesday morning were adding fuel to a rally that began on Monday. Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson rose 1.7% in premarket trading after it beat estimates on the top and bottom lines for the third quarter. Goldman Sachs rose more than 2% after strong trading results helped the investment bank beat expectations for earnings and revenue.
*****
&gt; Those reports continued a strong stretch of earnings, including beats from Bank of America and Bank of New York Mellon on Monday.
*****
&gt; The Dow is coming off a strong start to the week, adding roughly 551 points on Monday. The S&amp;P 500 also rose 2.65% for the day. The Nasdaq surged 3.43% as tech stocks rebounded, led by names such as Amazon, Meta Platforms and Microsoft. It was the best day for the tech-heavy index since July 27.
*****
&gt; Fears of a recession and overly aggressive central banks have helped push the U.S. markets to their lows of the year in recent weeks, but the solid start to earnings season may signal that the economy is currently in better shape than feared.
*****
&gt; “3Q and 4Q earnings should confirm fundamentals remain anchored in resilient labor market and Covid reopening. Equity valuation will likely remain tied to global central bank rhetoric and rates, which is turning incrementally less negative. As such, we see equities primed for upside into year-end on resilient 2H22 earnings, low equity positioning, very negative sentiment and given more reasonable valuation,” Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, JPMorgan’s head of global macro research, said in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; “Next year, however, we expect a more challenging earnings backdrop relative to current expectations,” he added.

2022-09-30 02:07:37,r/stocks,FCF Yield of Stocks I am Watching,"I recently compiled a list of stocks with their free cash flow (FCF) yield to see how good or bad that investment might be compared to a **2 year treasury bond (which is currently yielding \~4.2%)**. The yield was calculated using the enterprise value (EV) of the company since a lot of the companies carry a high debt load (think about AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Comcast for example). 

**Here is the equation for FCF yield of a company/stock that I used: FCF(ttm)/EV and FCF(5 yrs avg)/EV.** So basically I looked at the trailing 12 months (ttm) free cash flows and last 5 years average free cash flows as well. The data was taken from Yahoo Finance app and approximate. If you like any of the stocks based on their FCF yield, definitely do additional research to verify /cross check the numbers (some of the data might be inaccurate because of human error ).

2022-08-03 04:25:25,r/ValueInvesting,What's the appeal of stocks like NEE? Why do they get away with such a high PE?,"I've owned a small position in NEE (about 2%) and recently sold with a small gain.

I figured it has outperformed for many years so ah what the heck...

I heard that utilities are good in high inflation times because they have steady earnings, but I believe NEEs earnings have been declining for a few years?

What's the appeal with NEE if it's earnings have been declining?

Why does it get away with a 65 PE?

I.mean it is a steady stock with low volatility for the most part, but what's the appeal?

Why does it have such a high PE and have a 133% return the last 5 years and a 15% CAGR return for over 20 years?

It's also the heaviest weighting (about 15%) of XLU.

Also what would be the case for investing in a utilities index when it doesn't outperform the market as far as I can tell?

NEE HAS outperformed the market though.

Would there be a case to be made for investing in something that DOESN'T beat the market? Perhaps low volatility and security? Risk trade off?
 
For example JNJ typically does not outperform the market, but is a steady stock that also doesn't fall as much during volatile times, etc? So people with large amounts of cash would use JNJ as a sort of ""safe"" place to store cash instead of risking a short term large loss in the market?

Would that be a similar appeal of utilities also? Or a stock like NEE?

# [Stock futures gain ahead of a busy week of earnings, Fed meeting](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/24/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures rose on Monday morning, coming off a positive week for the major averages, as traders brace for the busiest week of corporate earnings, as well as insights into further interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 173 points, or 0.5%. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.5% each as well.
*****
&gt; On Friday, the major averages fell on the back of weaker-than-expected earnings from Snap that sent tech shares tumbling. Still, all three benchmarks closed the week higher, with the Dow up 2%. The S&amp;P 500 advanced about 2.6%, and the Nasdaq capped the week up 3.3%.
*****
&gt; It was the second positive week in the last three for the major averages. The S&amp;P 500 has been attempting a comeback after falling into a bear market earlier this year. The index is currently up more than 8% from its 2022 and trading near the highest levels since early June.
*****
&gt; Investors shifted into risk assets last week after absorbing some strong corporate results that had Wall Street deliberating whether the bear market has found a bottom.
*****
&gt; “Equities have managed to stage a rally MTD, and climb a wall of worry. The bounce has been led by cyclical and Growth stocks, helped by longer end yields stabilizing, which in turn eases the pressure on P/E’s,” Barclays’ Emmanuel Cau wrote in a Friday note.
*****
&gt; “This confirms to us that the market’s focus has switched from inflation worries to growth worries, with a sense that bad news is becoming good news again,” Cau added.
*****
&gt; As of Friday, about 21% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 reported earnings. Of those, nearly 70% beat analysts’ expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; Investors will face a stacked week of earnings ahead that will include reports from major tech giants Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve on Wednesday will also conclude its two-day policy meeting. Economists are widely expecting a three-quarter point hike.

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Tuesday as traders pored through more corporate earnings reports a day after the market failed to sustain a sharp rally.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures climbed 164 points, or 0.53%. S&amp;P 500 futures ticked up 0.68%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.72%.
*****
&gt; Johnson &amp; Johnson reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, although the pharmaceutical giant also cut its full-year revenue and profit guidance. Hasbro’s revenue for the previous quarter came in a tad below expectations, while the toymaker’s earnings per share beat a Refinitiv forecast.
*****
&gt; Netflix is set to report after the close Tuesday. Later in the week, Tesla, United Airlines, American Airlines, Snap, Twitter and Verizon are among those scheduled to report.
*****
&gt; IBM shares fell 5% in the premarket, after the tech company lowered its forecast for cash flow, even while reporting earnings that beat Wall Street’s earnings and revenue estimates.
*****
&gt; So far, roughly 8% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported calendar second-quarter earnings. Of those companies, about two-thirds have beaten analyst expectations, FactSet data shows.
*****
&gt; “When we think about earnings and we think about where stocks are now, we think there’s upside simply because there may be overpricing of this recession that some people think is imminent or already upon us,” said Julian Emanuel, senior managing director at Evercore ISI, during Monday’s Fast Money on CNBC.
*****
&gt; # Dow reversal
On Monday, the Dow shed more than 200 points to end the day in the red, reversing a morning rally fueled by solid earnings reports from Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. Oil broke above $100 a barrel, and b/itcoin surged to the highest levels seen since mid-June.
*****
&gt; Late in Monday’s session, stocks were dragged down on a Bloomberg report that Apple would slow hiring and spending on growth next year to prepare for a potential economic downturn. Shares of the iPhone maker ended the day about 2.1% lower.
*****
&gt; The news came as traders weigh the potential for a U.S. recession, especially as inflation remains at multidecade highs and the Federal Reserve raises rates to curb said inflationary pressures.

2022-07-17 18:10:26,r/ValueInvesting,What top 10 company will no longer be there in 5-10 years?,"It's tempting to buy some of the top growth companies after the recent market downturn but history tells us that  in 5 years 1-2 of the top 10 stocks will change and in 10 years up to half could be different. 

There is a chance one of the top 10 stocks at the end of 2021 already has hit there all time highs and may not fully recover.

The top 10 stocks in the US at the end of 2021 before most of the sell off were:

1. Apple
2. Microsoft
3. Alphabet
4. Amazon
5. Meta
6. Tesla
7. Berkshire Hathaway
8. Nvidia
9. Visa
10. JP Morgan and Chase

For international top 10 add in Tencent, Alibaba, and TSMC to the mix. Already from the end of 2021 to the second quarter, Alibaba and TSMC are out and UnitedHealth and JNJ are in. 

Personally, I think that Berkshire Hathaway and Nvidia are good bets to be out in 5-10 years. Berkshire because of questions about what is the company like when Buffett and Munger pass away. Nvidia I think may still be the leader in GPUs but never get back to previous all time highs due to decreased crypto mining demand. 

JP Morgan and Visa could flirt in and out of the top ten also.

What companies do you think will be out of the top ten in 5-10 year? And the million dollar question, which companies will replace them?",193,50,dtown4eva,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/w1av32/what_top_10_company_will_no_longer_be_there_in/,w1av32
2022-06-30 20:54:34,r/ValueInvesting,Maybe safe-haven stocks aren’t so safe after all?," With all this volatility, I’m hearing a lot of people advise that investors put their money in “safe-haven” stocks. Common safe-havens I hear people advise are companies like JNJ, PG, WMT, BMY, COST, and KO.

As a value investor, I decided to analyze these stocks to see if they are selling at fair or discounted value. These stocks typically make up a large portion of most value ETFs. But are they truly “value” stocks in the sense that they are selling below their intrinsic value?

Here is what I found:

**Johnson &amp; Johnson**

JNJ is a great company. It has a great ROE, impressive profit margins, low debt, fairly consistent earnings growth over the past 10 years and a solid brand.

But is it selling for fair value? Not even close. Assuming a 9% earnings CAGR (a generous assumption considering its growth rate for the past 5 years is 5.7% and analysts are estimating a 5% growth rate over the next 5 years), JNJ’s intrinsic value is only $94/share. It is currently selling at $177. JNJ would need to maintain a 19% earnings growth rate in order to justify its current price.

**Procter &amp; Gamble**

PG is another great company. It has all the same strengths as JNJ (High ROE, profit margins, low debt, consistent earnings and many strong brands). There are a few red flags, though. First, insiders are selling the stock at a rapid rate and its debt level is higher than JNJ. This is especially concerning because PG has significantly less cash to cover its debt. 

Despite these red flags, PG is worth well over $160billion. The only problem: its current market cap is $345billion. To justify its current, high price, PG would need to maintain a 21% growth rate, which is very unlikely considering its past growth rate of 9.5%.

Procter &amp; Gamble may be viewed as a safe haven by many investors, but is not a good value.

**Walmart**

WMT is a behemoth. But it is still very overpriced. By analyzing its fundamental value, including its earnings, past growth rate, expected future growth rate, profit margins, ROE and debt levels, I calculated Walmart’s intrinsic value to be $52/share. It is selling for $122. 

**Bristol-Myers Squibb**

BMY is, perhaps, the most overpriced stock on this list. I calculate its value at around $22/share. It is currently selling for $77. I was surprised to see that most pharmaceutical companies are selling at a massive premium, including LLY, ABBV, BIO, BIIB, GILD, MRK, PFE and WST. Pharmaceuticals do not look like good hunting grounds for value investors right now.

**Costco**

I love Costco. I spend hundreds of dollars there every month and have tremendous brand loyalty. But is Costco selling at a reasonable price? No.

I calculate the value of COST to be around $130billion. It has a market cap of $212billion. I wouldn’t touch Costco unless it drops 40-50%.

**Coca-Cola**

KO will always be part of value investment history because of Warren Buffett’s massive investment in the company. It was certainly a value stock in 1988. But is it a value stock now?

It doesn’t look like it. Despite its stellar ROE and profit margins, it is growing too slowly to justify its high PE of 26. It looks like it is selling at close to double its intrinsic value.

I also feel concerned about the level of insider selling on the stock. It was a legendary value buy in 1988, but it doesn’t look like a good value in 2022.

**VALUE OPTIONS**

There are some good value stocks out there.

FAANG- After the recent dip, all FAANG stocks look fairly priced to me. META, NFLX and AAPL look underpriced.

INTC- I calculate INTC’s intrinsic value to be around $100/share. It is selling for $38. The semiconductor space looks undervalued as a whole, so value investors should take a closer look here. 

Financials look like a great value. JPM, C, MA, DFS, TROW all look like good values. Plus, the tailwind of higher rates could help boost earnings even further.

Autos- With the exception of TSLA, most auto stocks look underpriced. TM, HMC and F are a few of my favorites. I also like auto dealer stocks like ABG and CRMT.

Retail- WMT and COST are both overpriced, but there is good value in the retail space. TGT is selling at a very reasonable price and BBY looks like it is selling at a 50% discount. There are also awesome values in the small-cap retail space like CONN, ASO, KIRK, BGFV and TCS.

2022-06-27 14:48:55,r/stocks,"BioHorizons of Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC) signs licensing and manufacturing agreement with Australian breakthrough bio-tech company","**BioHorizons of Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC)** reportedly accounts for 8-10% of the worlds global dental implant market. It just announced a 25 year deal with Australian listed bio-tech **Orthocell (OCC.AX)** in its dental application of its collagen scaffold technology, CelGro Bone (dental) aka Striate.

[https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/companies/biotech-orthocell-breaks-through-with-231m-licensing-deal-for-striate-plus-dental-device/news-story/3d139c17d8c0298d482e0924543ac751](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/companies/biotech-orthocell-breaks-through-with-231m-licensing-deal-for-striate-plus-dental-device/news-story/3d139c17d8c0298d482e0924543ac751)

It is no surprise BioHorizons picked up the technology. Orthocell gained FDA 510K approval (and EMA and TGA) in CelGro Dental early in 2021 having passed the FDA's animal studies showing significant improvements to standard grafts in the market. Additionally the procedure allows for one less surgery than the traditional two stage approach and repairs tissue faster as reported in human studies at just over 4 months vs 8 months as standard.

**BioHorizons of Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC)** noticeably put a number of clauses in the contract, effectively poison pills to discourage other suitors from any takeoever. The parent group may well be looking at the nerve application too. Orthocell forewent the 510K route with the FDA last year in its Nerve application of the same technology, Remplir, for a more lucrative regulatory route. This deal now explains that strategy, with sufficient funds to advance its CelGro Nerve application (Remplir) with the FDA (its already TGA approved as well) as recently highlighted on national Australian news:

[https://7news.com.au/news/public-health/new-hope-for-nerve-repair-as-collagen-scaffolding-technology-brings-movement-to-paralysed-patients-c-6762649](https://7news.com.au/news/public-health/new-hope-for-nerve-repair-as-collagen-scaffolding-technology-brings-movement-to-paralysed-patients-c-6762649)

It had already passed FDA pre-requisite studies for 510K approval in nerve, but recently announced 24 month data on a phase II human trial, that showed functional recovery of muscles controlled by the repaired nerve, improving to 85% (23 of 27) at 24 months post treatment and rather heart warmingly, in the quadriplegic patient cohort, functional recovery (MRC ≥3) of muscles controlled by the repaired nerve improving to 92% (11 of 12) at 24 months post-treatment. This data ofbviously cements perhaps a 'de novo' regulatory pathway with the FDA, given the higher novel proprietary advances made by the product, rather than a simple 510K route making it more attractive again to large US Pharma for further partnership in what it reports as a ""global addressable market in peripheral nerve reconstruction is estimated to be worth more than US$7.5 billion per annum, with approximately 3,000,000 procedures that could use Remplir™ completed each year.""

The main other potential candidate would be **Johnson and Johnson (JNJ)**. OCC is also overdue on announcing final data in its collaborative trial in its ATI (autologous tenocyte stem-cell injection) treatment with DePuy of Johnson and Johnson, which was guided for this quarter (suspect they will roll into July on that annoncement with this game changer). Initial data suggested:

"" 95% of participants at 12 months post OrthoATI™ treatment reported a level of function of the treated shoulder consistent with a successful outcome after having received an average of 4 failed conservative treatments including physiotherapy and steroid injection.""

The company reported that ""Ortho-ATI® could be applicable to &gt;480,000 rotator cuff patients per year in the US alone, which equates to a market opportunity of approximately US$4-5 billion"". There are 4,000 tendons in the human body, with the product also having shown similar potential in achilles, gluteal, patellar and other tendons, with published medical studies in tennis elbow.",14,5,Historical_Job_8609,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/vluqlj/biohorizons_of_henry_schein_inc_hsic_signs/,vluqlj

2022-05-07 05:19:28,r/stocks,The best and hardest time to buy,"""The time to buy is when there's blood on the streets.""

I find the biggest difficulty in investing is the discipline to manage your emotions. This post is for those who feel the same way.

Right now, everything is down (except oil). Even the people who started DCAing index funds recently -- allegedly the safest way to invest -- have lost money. The natural instinct is ""damn all of this, I cut my losses and I'm outta this madhouse"". The problem is: That's the worst thing to do.

Stopping to invest/DCA in times of trouble is a great mistake. *Now* is a far better time to put money in the market than was a year ago. It's unfortunately also much harder, emotionally. Because one not only has to fight the own feeling of fear and uncertainty, but also the one-thousand bears that crawl out of their caves, prod their chest and tell how everything is gonna get worse.

The problem of reddit is that it's an amplification of market sentiment and yesterday's losses. It's a manic-depressed Mr. Market telling you how the world is going to end tomorrow. That makes it even harder to feel good putting more money into something that has already created a loss. But I am absolutely convinced that the long term winners of this game are those that make the right decision to keep on investing today and in the months to come. There's a reason Warren Buffet sold last year, but is spending his cash now. Because whatever anybody bought last year, they can get cheaper now. So don't let Mr. Market be your master, but make him your servant. 

I don't know how the market will be tomorrow, in a month, or a year. Perhaps things get worse before they get better (which is why I invest my spare cash over time, rather than everything next Monday). But I am sure, that, down the line, things are gonna be fine.

I am not advocating to hold onto bad businesses based on hopium. But good stocks of a solid business won't go bankrupt. AAP, JNJ and TGT will still live tomorrow to take consumer money. Broad index funds will still represent strong businesses. So my advice to all who are new to this game and sad now: Don't let your own fear or current craziness deter you from long term investing. Stick with it and reap the rewards in years to come.",58,29,joe-re,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/uk4dte/the_best_and_hardest_time_to_buy/,uk4dte

If you bought into some memestock, sorry, but sucks to suck, that likely won't recover.  If you're holding quality stocks (i.e. MSFT, JNJ, AAPL, etc...) you will be fine in time, or better yet, if you're holding ETFs (i.e. SPY, VOO, QQQ) just keep buying and don't even worry about it.  

The market always feels like the point of no return when we are in these cycles, but guess what, the market bounces back.  Sure, some stocks don't, which is why its wise to stay away from the crap memes and just buy ETFs or super solid companies, because they have shown us they always come back. 

I don't know where the bottom is, nobody knows, it could be today, it could be 2 years from now, time will tell.

We research the company, we know they’re profitable and stable, but we end up paying too much for their stock. Which companies in your portfolio are you holding that you entered at too high of a price? I’ll start…

1) MMM - I grabbed 10 shares at around 178 after it came down from 200 alongside AMGN and JNJ. Of the three purchased at the time, only MMM hasn’t printed. It’s a “forever” hold for me, but man, why did I think the high 170s was a decent price?

2) DIS - Bought on my first day in the market back in April of 2021. I had no clue how to value stocks at the time, and I grabbed them at 187. It’s only returned to that price once since then (August earnings beat), but otherwise it’s a permanent red mark.

3) INTC - Same as Disney. Day one purchase, just happened to buy when it was at 67. Have since added more at 47 to bring my average down, but wow, why the rush to buy?

4) CI - Not a day one buy, but I bought based on its up trending chart, hoping to continue riding the wave. Little did I know my 259 entry would be near the top of the wave, because CI since then dipped as far down as the high 190s.

5) RIO - Lured in by its dividends, I happened to buy at 90 when commodity prices were near their peak. It climbed to 97 before quickly tumbling into the 60s. It’s climbing again though, but I need to sell it and buy back in when commodities drop again.

*****

# [S&amp;P 500 futures slide by more than 1% as market’s wild ride continues](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/24/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock index futures fell sharply in early trading Tuesday, after a wild session that saw the Dow erase a more than 1,100-point decline to finish the day in positive territory.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 230 points, or 0.7%, having earlier fallen by as much as 380 points. S&amp;P 500 futures dropped 1.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures fell 1.9%.
*****
&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield, which has climbed this year as the Federal Reserve tightens its monetary policy, rose Tuesday morning. The higher rates pressured growth-oriented parts of the market with technology shares lower in early morning trading.
*****
&gt; During regular trading Monday, the Dow gained 99 points, or 0.3%, and snapped a six-day losing streak. At the lows of the day, the 30-stock benchmark shed 3.25%. The S&amp;P 500 advanced 0.28% for its first positive session in five, after losing nearly 4% earlier in the day. At one point the benchmark index fell into correction territory, dropping 10% from its Jan. 3 record close.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6%, reversing a 4.9% decline from earlier in the day. The comeback was the first time the tech-heavy index clawed back a 4% loss to end higher since 2008.
*****
&gt; “The buyers are coming in to buy the dip here,” Lindsey Bell, Ally’s chief money and markets strategist, said Monday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.” “Things looked a little bit over-stretched to the oversold side, so it’s not surprising. But that doesn’t mean we are going to be in the clear ... there’s a lot that we have going on this week,” she said
*****
&gt; Ultimately, Bell said volatility is here to stay until the Fed begins hiking rates.
*****
&gt; Despite Monday’s comeback, the S&amp;P 500 is still down 7.5% in January, its worst month since March 2020 at the onset of the pandemic.
*****
&gt; Markets have been rattled by a combination of factors, primarily a Federal Reserve expected to start raising interest soon to combat inflation, and geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine. The economic impact of omicron also has been a concern, though signs that the Covid variant spread is diminishing have lessened those fears.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s signal that it would began raising rates as soon as this March is the main culprit behind the market’s volatile start to the year.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee will begin its two-day meeting on Tuesday, with an interest rate decision slated for Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. The Fed is not expected to begin hiking rates just yet, but is likely to maintain a path to tighter policy this year as it fights the highest inflation in decades.
*****
&gt; “We’re in what I call the triple threat of ... rapidly rising rates, and the market has been working overtime, as have all of the algorithms, to try to figure out what that means, and what that pace means for valuations and global equities,” UBS Private Wealth Management’s Alli McCartney told CNBC Monday.
*****
&gt; Monday’s reversal was “capitulation,” she said, before adding that while volatility is here to stay, the market narrative is beginning to shift towards one of strong earnings growth supporting stocks.
*****
&gt; Monday’s volatility follows the S&amp;P 500′s worst week since the pandemic took hold in March 2020. Spooked by rising rates, investors have rotated out of high-growth areas of the market in favor of safer bets. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note stood at 1.769% on Monday.
*****
&gt; The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has been hit especially hard and fell into correction territory last week. The index is down 11.4% so far this year, underperforming the S&amp;P and Dow, which have declined 7.5% and 5.4%, respectively.
*****
&gt; “Considering expectations for solid gains in the economy and corporate profits...we’re not convinced the fundamentals support any near-term technical weakness beyond the classic 10.0% correction,” said John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management. “Yet a review of the technical and fundamental backdrops suggests a bottom is forming,” he added.
*****
&gt; Investors digested a slew of quarterly earnings reports before the open.
*****

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, January 24, 2022**

What an action-packed day! After dropping steeply in the morning, stocks reversed sharply higher to close the day in the green as market participants look ahead to a busy week of earnings and new commentary by the Federal Reserve. 

**Markets Today (low of the day to closing price)**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -3.72% to +0.42%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -4.75% to +0.46%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -3.03% to +0.43%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -2.72% to +2.30%
* Volatility Index (VIX):  +18.71% to 2.24%

* Shopify (SHOP): -11.45% to +6.39%
* Goldman Sachs (GS): -4.82% to -0.15%

This year has not been kind to stocks so far, with expectations for tighter monetary conditions by the Federal Reserve causing the 10-year Treasury yield to spike to spike to its highest level in two years, sparking volatility in technology and growth stocks which greatly benefited from easy financial conditions since 2022. With inflation persisting at a higher level than originally expected, members of the Fed are now calling for three to four interest rate hikes next year, with the earliest projected for March 2022. 

On Wednesday, the Fed is set to have its January monetary policy meeting and press conference by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, which is expected to produce no changes to existing policy. However, as the Fed looks in to rein rising inflation, the meeting will likely set the stage for the Fed to indicate the potential timeline for an interest rate hike. 

Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a note to clients “Until we get a further selloff in risk assets, the Fed will simply not be convinced that raising interest rates and reducing the size of its balance sheet in 2022 will more likely cause a recession rather than a soft landing. Either outcome would dampen inflation, of course, which is why 10-year Treasury yields have stopped climbing. But only a soft landing would allow public companies to continue to post strong earnings. The risk of a hard landing is why U.S. large caps are under so much stress.""

As of the start of the week, only about 13% of S&amp;P 500 companies had reported quarterly results, according to Goldman Sachs. And so far, one trend that has begun to emerge has been relatively weak commentary about the outlook for this year. 

David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, said “Investors are very interested in forward-looking guidance from management, and recent information on that front has been concerning. Bank executives emphasized higher operating costs in the coming year. Following the release of 4Q results, only six companies in the S&amp;P 500 provided formal near-term guidance for 1Q 2022. Unfortunately, five of the six firms guided below consensus for next quarter, including three of the stocks that actually beat expectations in Q4."" 

Looking ahead, a number of large-cap stocks are set to report earnings results this week, offering investors a view into how companies are holding up amid surging Omicron cases, rising inflation, and a tight labor market. Here are some of the earnings I will be paying close attention to:

**Tuesday:** Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), American Express (AXP), Microsoft (MSFT), Capital One (COF), Texas Instruments (TXN)

**Wednesday:** Boeing (BA), Abbott (ABT), Tesla (TSLA), Intel (INTC), Lam Research (LRCX), Las Vegas Sands (LVS), ServiceNow (NOW)

**Thursday:** Mastercard (MA), McDonald’s (MCD), Apple (AAPL), Robinhood (HOOD), Visa (V), Western Digital (WDC), Atlassian (TEAM), Valero (VLO)

**Friday:** Chevron (CVX), Caterpillar (CAT), Weyerhaeuser (WY)

**Highlights**

* IHS Markit's preliminary January services purchasing managers index (PMI) slid to 50.9 from December's 57.6. This marked the lowest level in about 18 months. Readings above the neutral level of 50.0 indicate expansion in a sector. Meanwhile, the institution's manufacturing PMI also fell in January to a 15-month low, reaching 55.0 compared to December's 57.7.
* AT&amp;T (T) is reportedly rolling out the fastest consumer broadband offered by major internet providers
* Tesla Inc on Monday fought back against JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co over a disputed bond contract, countersuing the bank for seeking a ""windfall"" following Elon Musk's notorious 2018 tweet that he might take his electric car company private. In a filing in Manhattan federal court, Tesla accused JPMorgan of ""bad faith and avarice"" for demanding $162.2 million after the bank had unilaterally changed the terms of warrants it received when Tesla sold convertible bonds in 2014.
* Meta Platforms (FB) said on Monday that its research team has built a new artificial intelligence supercomputer that it thinks will be the fastest in the world when completed in mid-2022.
* Texas and the District of Columbia sued Alphabet Inc's Google on Monday over what he called deceptive location tracking practices that invade users’ privacy.
* Luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz is teaming up with self-driving sensor maker Luminar Technologies Inc. (LAZR) to pursue fully-automated driving 
* China cut its one-year loan prime rate by 10 basis points. The home mortgage rate was also cut by 5 basis points. Following the lending rate cuts, shares of U.S.-listed Chinese tech companies traded mostly higher in Hong Kong on Thursday, lifting the benchmark Hang Seng Index to its highest level in almost two months

# **Markets are expected to remain on edge as the Fed meets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/21/markets-are-expected-to-remain-on-edge-as-the-fed-meets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Market turbulence is likely to continue in the week ahead as the Federal Reserve meets and the biggest of big tech —Apple and Microsoft — report earnings.
*****
&gt; Stocks on Friday closed out their worst week since 2020, with big losses in technology and consumer discretionary names. FANG darling Netflix was ripped after its Thursday afternoon earnings, and traders are watching to see whether the same fate will take down other big tech names.
*****
&gt; It was a painful week on Wall Street, with the Nasdaq slumping 7.6% for the week, its worst performance since March, 2020. The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 4,397, down 5.7%, and is now 8.7% from its Jan. 4 high.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq has fallen 15.5% from its high and is off to its worst start to the year, through the first 14 trading days, since 2008, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve’s meeting Tuesday and Wednesday trumps everything else for markets, as investors await any new clues on how much the central bank will raise interest rates this year and when it will start. Economists expect the Fed to steer markets to a quarter-percentage-point March rate hike.
*****
&gt; There is also an avalanche of major earnings reports expected, including nearly half the Dow 30′s blue chips, such as 3M, IBM, Intel, Caterpillar and American Express. The two biggest stocks in terms of market capitalization, Microsoft and Apple, report Tuesday and Thursday respectively. Tesla reports Wednesday.
*****
&gt; The economy will also be a focus with a first look at fourth-quarter GDP on Thursday, and Friday’s personal consumption expenditures data, which includes the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.
*****
&gt; Stocks could be in for more volatile trading, after a wild week of seesaw action resulted in steep declines in major indexes. The weakest major sectors for the week were consumer discretionary, off 8.5%, followed by communication services and technology, both lower by about 7%.
*****
&gt; Earnings season has been mixed so far with some high-profile negative stock reactions when investors did not like what they heard.
*****
&gt; Netflix stock cratered Friday, losing 22% after a disappointing disclosure about subscriber data when it released earnings Thursday afternoon. JP Morgan Chase fell sharply a week earlier when it reported higher expenses and slower trading activity.
*****
&gt; “We do not think that the earnings season is a macro catalyst to send the indexes significantly in one direction or the other. This is a stock-by-stock story,” said Julian Emanuel, chief equity, derivatives and quantitative strategist at Evercore ISI.
*****
&gt; “The good reports are likely to be rewarded but in a much more muted fashion, whereas the companies that miss on either [revenues or earnings] are going to be disproportionately punished. It doesn’t matter if you beat or miss, but if you had negative comment around margins and costs, you’re going to pay a price,” he added.
*****
&gt; # Fed ahead
&gt; The same inflation that is showing up in rising costs in company earnings and higher prices has become a major concern for the Fed. Investors will be listening closely to hear how worried the Fed is about inflation when Chairman Jerome Powell briefs the media Wednesday afternoon after the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee releases its statement.
*****
&gt; The Fed is not expected to raise interest rates or change policy at this meeting, but it could be setting the stage for how it will act when it finishes up its bond buying program, likely in March. Many economists expect the Fed could start raising its fed funds target rate from near-zero with a quarter-percentage-point hike in March.
*****
&gt; “The baseline is we see four hikes and the start of quantitative tightening somewhere around the middle to later in the year,” Emanuel said. “I don’t think the Fed is going to do anything to talk the market out of that stance.”
*****
&gt; The Fed has also said it could move to shrink its balance sheet this year, and that would be another type of policy tightening, as the central bank steps back from replacing the maturing securities on its balance with market purchases. That would in essence start to decrease the size of the nearly $9 trillion balance sheet.
*****
&gt; The Fed has sounded much more hawkish, or in favor of rate hikes and other policy tightening, particularly since it released its December forecast. Powell is not likely to change his tone this week, even with stocks selling off, Emanuel said.
*****
&gt; “If Powell were going to come off sounding dovish, the presumption would be that would be a positive for the market, but we might argue that would not be,” he said. “If the market doesn’t really believe he’s going with the four-hike plan, it’s very likely that 10-year yields which have broken out of the three-year range by going over 1.80%, could make a very quick move to 2%.”
*****
&gt; He added “growth is already backfooted versus value. That would be very destabilizing for the market.”
*****
&gt; The Fed is already considered to be behind the curve by some Fed watchers.
*****
&gt; “The Fed has never responded this slowly to an emerging inflation risk and even today is signaling a benign hiking cycle,” wrote Ethan Harris, Bank of America’s head of global economic research. “If they are wrong, and inflation settles closer to 3% than 2%, it is bad news for both stocks and bonds.”
*****
&gt; # Bond yields stall
Bond yields continued to stair-step higher early in the past week but fell back down by the end of the week. The widely watched benchmark 10-year Treasury yield touched 1.9% in the middle of the week before slipping back to 1.76% Friday.
*****
&gt; Ian Lyngen, BMO head of U.S. rates strategy, said the bond market is pricing in a move in the fed funds rate to 1.75%. He said the Fed would have to indicate it could push the funds target higher in order for the 10-year to get to 2%
*****
&gt; “We expect it will consolidate in this range until Wednesday,” Lyngen said. “If the Fed does not come out as more hawkish, then we’ll see a classic ‘buy the rumor, sell the fact,’ and the 10-year yield drifts lower.” Yields move opposite price.
*****
&gt; Tech and growth stocks have been most negatively impacted by the move higher in rates. Those stocks are valued on the prospect of their future profits, and the assumption is in an environment of cheap money, valuations can be higher.
*****
&gt; But as the Fed tightens and inflation continues to flare, many strategists expect cyclical and value stocks to perform better. Since the start of the year, the technology sector is down 11.4%. Energy has been the outperformer, and is the only major sector higher this year, up 12.8%.
*****
&gt; “The Fed’s whole intent of this is to tighten financial conditions so in a way, if you’re the Fed what you’ve seen in the first three weeks of the year you may be perfectly fine with,” Emanuel said. “I don’ think if you’re Powell you’re going to try to talk the market out of the mode that it’s currently in. I think you’re pretty happy with how the year has started.”
*****
&gt; Emanuel expects the S&amp;P 500 to end the year at 5,100. As for the current sell-off, he said the S&amp;P 500 is likely to reach its 200-day moving average at about 4,425, but there’s no guarantee that will be the bottom of this sell-off.

&gt; # Tech Sheds a Trillion

&gt; Earlier this week in our Sector Weightings report, we highlighted how the weight of the Technology sector remains well above that of any other sector, though, it did come off recent highs. In terms of market cap, the Tech sector is still valued at nearly $11 trillion. The next largest sectors are Health Care and Consumer Discretionary at a little over $5 trillion. Utilities is currently the only sector with a market cap under $1 trillion. Remember, back in April 2020, the S&amp;P 1500 Energy sector's market cap got down to just $701 billion!

&gt; Taking a look at the changes three weeks into the new year, Tech has already shed over a trillion dollars in market cap. Combined, Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, and Communication Services have also fallen by over a trillion dollars. Meanwhile, only Energy has seen its market cap increase.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/01/012122-Sector-Mkt-caps.png))**

&gt; As for the individual stocks of the S&amp;P 500, there are currently five members with market caps above $1 trillion, and those five stocks have seen a combined drop in market cap of roughly $850 billion year to date. Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are the biggest of these with market caps of $2.69 trillion and $2.65 trillion respectively, and as such, their declines year to date are the largest of any S&amp;P 500 stock. Of the 25 largest S&amp;P 500 members, only a handful have seen their market caps rise so far in 2022. Exxon Mobil (XOM) has seen the largest increase followed by Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/B) and Chevron (CVX).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/01/012122-Sector-Mkt-caps-Largest.png))**

&gt; In the table below, we show the 25 S&amp;P 500 stocks that have seen their market caps rise the most this year. Not only does an Energy stock top the list, but across these 25 names, Energy stocks have the most representation. Financials also have a decent number making the list while not a single Consumer Discretionary or Tech name is to be found.

&gt; # More Lows Than Highs

&gt; With more than half of the S&amp;P 500 lower today, the index is once again looking to end the week in the red and with weak breadth. As a result of the consistent declines lately across the index, the net reading of the percentage of stocks at new 52-week highs versus lows is on pace to see the first negative reading since December 2nd.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/01/012122-Large1.png))**

&gt; Moving down through the spectrum of market caps, the readings on net new highs only get worse. The S&amp;P 400 which is comprised of mid-cap names has an even lower reading of -6.23% of net new highs today. That is the lowest since November 30th, and prior to that, you would have to go back to the record low readings of March 2020 to find the last time that there were as wide of a margin between the number of stocks hitting new lows versus new highs.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/01/012122-Mid1.png))**

&gt; Moving down again to the small cap S&amp;P 600, once again the reading only gets worse. This index is seeing a double-digit negative reading. With a net 11.13% at new 52-week lows, it is the weakest reading since March 23, 2020 and is in the 5th percentile of readings going back to the start of the data in 1995.

&gt; # A/D Line Nearing Selling Climax Indices Test Support

&gt; Today’s late market selloff put further pressure on support levels as 69% of stocks traded today declined while only 26% advanced, including all of the nearly 9000 stocks traded on NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ combined. This is close to the Advance Decline Selling Climax levels 70% total issues declining with no more than 15% advancing. It appears we are nearing the end of this January selloff, which may occur as we approach the FOMC meeting next week.

&gt; The chart above shows the major market averages have caught up with the decline in the NASDAQ and NYSE Advance/Decline Lines that has been going on in earnest since July 2021 and more precipitously since the November highs. NDX and NASDAQ have both hit the 10% correction level this week down -10.4% and -11.9% respectively at today’s close. From their early January highs DJIA and S&amp;P 500 are down -5.7% and -6.5% respectively.

&gt; As you can see from the chart below the NASDAQ 100 (NDX) has fallen through two support levels at 15700 and 15250 rather quickly over the past two weeks. In the process NDX and breached it’s 50- (pink line) and 200-day (blue line) moving averages and two monthly pivot point support levels (green dotted lines) as well as the uptrend line since the March 2021 low. NDX currently sits just below 14900 support and right on the uptrend line from the September/October 2020 lows.

&gt; # How Did Stocks Do The First Year Under President Biden?

&gt; President Biden took over the Oval Office a year ago yesterday, on January 20, 2021. So how did things go for the stock market? Let’s dive into it.

&gt; “The Dow gained 12.3% the first year under President Biden, which is right about the average first year return of 12.1%,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But where things really stand out is how many new highs were made, with a very impressive 43 new highs, the third most ever.”

&gt; As we share in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Dow gained 12.3% during his first year in office, which ranks 9th out of all the first years for all Presidents since 1900.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/blog-chart-1.21.22-1.png))**

&gt; Breaking it down a little more, stocks historically have done much better under a Democrat that first year than under a Republican, although that 91% gain under FDR had a lot to do with that. Still, stocks rose more than 30% during both President Obama’s and President Trump’s first years, breaking with the historical trend.

&gt; And of course, let’s not forget that stocks did amazingly well right after President Biden won the election in November 2020, so you could say some of those gains were pulled forward perhaps. Here’s a chart we shared a year ago on this. It was the best Election Day to Inauguration Day return ever.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blog-1.21.22-2.png))**

&gt; Lastly, the stock market’s gain during President Biden’s first 100 days in office was one of the best ever.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/blog-1.21.22-3.png))**

&gt; All in all, the economy and stocks did quite well the first year under President Biden. Given this is a midterm year and emotions will run high, we want to remind investors to separate your politics from your investments. Many people have not liked past Presidents, only to miss out on big gains. A strong economy (and we expect it to be this year) matters a lot more to your investments than the makeup of Congress or who is in the White House.

&gt; # January Seasonal Pattern Update: Tech &amp; Small-Cap Extend Declines

&gt; As of today’s close NASDAQ is down 8.3% and the Russell 2000 is down 8.1%. S&amp;P 500 and DJIA are down 4.9% and 3.6% respectively. This is the worst start to a year on the 12th trading day since 2016 when DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 were all down over 9%. Compared to the recent 21-year seasonal pattern for January, weakness could persist through the end of the month, but given the current magnitude of declines some modest recovery before the end of the month is also likely. One possible catalyst for a late-month rally could come from the Fed on January 26.

&gt; The first Fed rate hike is like taking the training wheels off. Some volatility is perfectly normal, but by no means does it mean you fall down. In fact, bull markets go another 3 years plus after the first Fed hike, with the S&amp;P 500 up nearly 70%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zyQEBTd.png))**

&gt; Today the S&amp;P 500 closed beneath it's December low during the first quarter. Happened 36 other times since 1950. Full year up 50% of time and up only 0.3% on avg. Definitely a concern for the bulls. Not the end of the world, but a worrisome signal.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9fmezdB.png))**

&gt; Compare this to the 36 times the December lows held in Q1. S&amp;P 500 up 18.6% on average and higher 94% of the time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yKzBj2A.jpg))**

&gt; Here's a nice way to show how the December Low Indicator is a big deal. The 36 times the December lows held in Q1, full year was rather strong. The 36 times it didn't hold (like 2022), there was some tougher sledding. For now, we chalk this up as a warning sign.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wrNHRqZ.jpg))**

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is down 5.9% in Jan so far. Worst since 2016 when it was down 9.0% at one point during the month (closed the month down 5.1% though). Worst ever? Down 10.8% in 2008 and 10.9% in 2009. Again, this is the monthly low, not what where it closed at the end of the month.

&gt; It is worth noting that midterm years can be quite weak early in the year. Incredibly, the average midterm year (since '50) is actually down YTD as of October 5th..

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pQBJkMy.jpg))**

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has already pulled back 6.5% this year. Remember though, the average year (since 1980) sees a 14% pullback and your average midterm year (since 1950) pulls back 17%. After a year with very little volatility, the bottom line is 2022 was likely due for a rockier ride.

2021-12-24 19:10:37,r/stocks,Do stocks like PG make sense in an accumulators portfolio?,"To me I think of proctor and gamble more as a way to preserve already attained wealth.  To me that would be something like $50 to $100k i didn't want to risk much of and may still be some years from retirement.

If I was within maybe 5 years I'd maybe have even less than the $100k (for example) in something like a PG just to make up for inflation.

Anyways I'm wondering if someone like myself that's in accumulation mode should even have a stock like PG with any sizeable percentage.

I mean if I have 10 to 20 years till retirement, why not something like COST instead?  Or heck even MSFT performing poorly should give a better return than Proctor and Gamble.

Even things like JNJ.  Are those better suited to preserving already attained wealth?

I realize bonds were in the past, but now they don't yield that much.

Back in John Bogles days bonds could yield up to 10% with relatively low risk.

So I guess my main question is is it better to be mostly in growth type stocks if you have a long runway and not much of a portfolio?

Does holding 5% in Proctor and Gamble (one stock for example) do anything for someone sub 6 figures portfolio?

&gt;Under CEO Arvind Krishna, IBM has spun off a pedestrian business of managing data centers into Kyndryl Holdings (KD), refocused on the cloud and artificial intelligence, and vowed to start growing again for the first time in about a decade.

&gt; Wall Street is skeptical about IBM’s prospects, but one bull, BofA Global Research’s Wamsi Mohan, has compared Krishna to Satya Nadella, the Microsoft CEO who transformed the company over the past seven years.
&gt; 
&gt; IBM, whose shares trade around $126, is valued at 11 times projected 2022 earnings. And it has the highest dividend yield in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, at 5.3%.
&gt; 
&gt; If Krishna is successful in boosting sales and margins while making IBM relevant again, there could be a lot of upside in a largely forgotten stock.

Is IBM really a hidden gem or is it rightfully forgotten? Here are the rest of the picks:

*****

#[Dow futures up nearly 100 points after J&amp;J shares pop on split news](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/11/stock-futures-inch-higher-as-wall-street-looks-to-avoid-losing-week-amid-high-inflation.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures moved slightly higher early Friday morning as Wall Street looked to end the week on a positive note after a historic inflation report.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 90 points. S&amp;P 500 futures added 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Dow component Johnson &amp; Johnson saw its shares pop about 3% in premarket trading following a Wall Street Journal report that the company is splitting in two. Johnson &amp; Johnson is reportedly breaking off its consumer health division into a separate publicly-traded company.
*****
&gt; The move in futures comes after the stock market appears to have withstood the hottest inflation report in 30 years on Wednesday. The major indexes are on track to snap five-week winning streaks but are still within striking distance of their recent records.
*****
&gt; Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for the Schwab Center for Financial Research, said that year-over-year comparisons to an abnormal 2020 and rising wages may have dented the reaction to the inflation report.
*****
&gt; “Big numbers get big headlines, and yes prices are higher, but you’ve got also wage increases that are just about to the same amount as inflation is. So inflation is definitely real, but the impact isn’t quite as severe as people think,” Frederick said.
*****
&gt; The inflation report was the latest complication from economic data that investors have sorted through in recent weeks, with some professional investors looking optimistically toward 2022.
*****
&gt; “We’ve probably reached maximum supply chain disruption and I think the labor market is going to free up a bit as we saw with the jobs report last Friday,” said Brent Schutte, the chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual.
*****
&gt; This week has seen more dramatic action in the bond market, where the inflation report led to a sharp reversal from the recent decline in the 10-year Treasury yield on Wednesday. The bond market was closed on Thursday for Veterans Day.
*****
&gt; On Thursday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5%, while the S&amp;P 500 edged slightly higher. The Dow dropped nearly 160 points, dragged down by Disney’s post-earnings slide.
*****
&gt; Through Thursday, the Dow is down 1.1% for the week, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are down 1% and 1.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; After a busy week of earnings and economic data releases, Friday is relatively light for investors. The preliminary read for November consumer sentiment and the September report on job openings and labor turnover will be released Friday morning.

2021-11-05 04:55:04,r/stocks,Johnson and Johnson - a possible cellular medicine revolution?,"Quite a few analysts have bemoaned where J&amp;J's next business growth catalyst comes from.

Practically every human being will endure some sort of degenerative tendon injury in their lifetime.  You have 4,000 tendons in your body.  50% of people over 60 years old have rotator cuff (four shoulder tendons) tears of some form - 95% over 80.

4 years ago Johnson and Johnson announced a collaborative trial with little known Orthocell (OCC.AX) of Australia.  It takes patients own tendon stem cells (Tenocytes) from a biopsy, multiples them into millions of cells over 4-6 weeks and then re-injects into the partially torn tendon.  It mimics and massively amplifies the body's own injury repair mechanisms with a massive dose of the patients own tendon stem cells.

(My case anecdotal, but the procedure saved me from disability 7 years ago)

Orthocell has conducted over 1,000 stem-cell procedures over the last decade.  It has reported an 87.5% satisfaction/success rate amongst patients.

The results of a four year collaborative randomised controlled trial are due out in the next month or so, of the treatment vs corticosteroid injections as a control.  There is a second trial ongoing vs surgery.

OCC has already gained FDA (EMA and TGA) approval on another collagen based product. It has over 100 patents across the world on its treatments and products, yet remains a largely unheard of, small entity.  The results of the J&amp;J sponsored trial and a possible ensuing partnership or takeover might change that.

This is a very simple and convenient out-patient procedure that will be phase 2/3 tested soon.  J&amp;J partnered last year with Fate Therapeutics in the far more complex area of induced pluripotent stem cells for off the shelf NK- and T-cell products (a popular area of big pharma pursuit).  This treatment presents a far quicker and simpler business opportunity for the DePuy Synthes aspect of J&amp;J to quickly provide a cheap ($5,000 US?) convenient treatment options for patients. It would also likely become the preferred first treatment for insurance companies.  Shoulder rotator cuff surgeries in the US can be well over $20,000 with rehab and hospital fees etc.

If JNJ do announce a takeover or partnership, this could be a very lucrative and simply commercialised business opportunity for J&amp;J that has a massive potential mkt. around the world.",35,20,Historical_Job_8609,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qn2pe2/johnson_and_johnson_a_possible_cellular_medicine/,qn2pe2

2021-10-25 20:35:39,r/stocks,"Curious, was MRNA manipulated on Friday 10/22?","I see this happen all the time, but was wondering what you guys think about this one. On Friday, 10/22:

Deutsche Bank's Emmanuel Papadakis initiated coverage of Moderna (ticker: MRNA) with a Sell rating on the shares and a target price of $225.

This is also while:

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has recommended booster doses of Moderna (MRNA) and Johnson &amp; Johnson's (JNJ) COVID-19 vaccines for certain groups.     

This triggered a massive selloff and the stock fell from $333 to a low of $317 that day, closing around $326 after multiple days of gains. My question is:

Why does MRNA fall even though there were generally favorable news for the stock that day? 

As in, CDC endorsing took weeks of work while Mr. Papadakis was only a day thing.

Now the stock is sitting at $345 gaining again today building on news starting from the CDC endorsement.

Was this an inside job to cover their Short positions? I am completely baffled by the market response. I would love to understand how this scenario works from a financial (not speculative) perspective.

I am 26 yrs old and looking for some safe investments to make. I understand there is a risk that the market can collapse within the next 2 years. If that happens I would have to adjust my time horizons. I am looking for safe investments while I amass savings to buy a home.

&amp;#x200B;

As of right now I have about 30,000 CAD (local currency) in my investing account invested in the VFV TO and VOO. Some of the 30K is in random stocks (Loblaw, JNJ, FVRR, etc.) but it's largely in index funds.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything anybody can recommend because as of right now every time I get paid I dump any leftover money into VFV TO.

  
Thanks.",10,5,Clownier,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qf6jhz/looking_for_opinions_approx_2_year_time_horizon/,qf6jhz

**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, October 20, 2021**

***Quick rant:*** *It’s remarkable how quickly market sentiment changes. It seems two weeks ago, everyone was predicting an imminent market crash and, in many occasions, going as far as insulting my intelligence for presenting a different viewpoint and remaining bullish even during the height of the Evergrande situation and a looming US debt default. Now it seems the doomsaying posts and articles have all but disappeared. The market has dipped significantly roughly 5-6 times this year and every time it happens I see the same upswell of doomsaying articles and market crash predictors. Not to go on a rant, but it amazes me how willing people are to fight against the trend. Like I’ve said, it is important to acknowledge risks present in the market and be prepared to react to the unforeseen, but I don’t get why people decide to consciously decide to fight market trends, it is much easier and more profitable to just ride them until you can’t anymore. There’s a saying that goes, pessimists sound smart, optimists make money. I have found this saying to be true.* 

The incredible rally in the stock market continued, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) climbing seven straight days to claw back the losses suffered in September when the index dipped -5% from highs for the first time all year. While the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly today, the index has rocketed more than 6% higher from the lows on October 4, a stunning comeback. The Dow Jones (DIA) reached a new intraday all-time high, carried by continued strength in financial stocks. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, traded modestly higher today. Market participants remain encouraged by stronger-than-expected corporate profits amid ongoing supply-chain pressures.

Very strong corporate earnings reports from bellwethers like big banks, Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), and Procter and Gamble (PG) have assuaged fears that corporate profits would slow down dramatically amid supply chain constraints. As the earnings season kicked off, market participants were nervous that ongoing inflationary pressures, labor market imbalances, and congestions issues at ports would greatly weigh on corporate profits. So far, that has not proven to be the case. 

Jon Adams, Senior Investment Strategist at BMO Capital Markets said, “We think investorshave been too pessimistic on earnings expectations. It does look like Q2 was likely the peak, but Q3 is going to be strong, probably above 30% year-over-year growth. We think the strength will continue into the fourth quarter, we’re not overly concerned about profit margins. We are closely monitoring supply chain issues and increasing wage pressures but still think that profit margins are at healthy levels, and that there's more upside to come.""

**Highlights**

* The price of … reached new all-time highs, breaking $65k for the first time after the first-ever ETF was launched in the market yesterday.
* Sharers of Pinterest (PINS) rocketed higher after Bloomberg reported that PayPal (PYPL) was considering acquiring the company for $70 a share (roughly $39 billion). Shares of PINS were up more than 10% while shares of PYPL fell after the report was released.
* Adobe (ADBE) says it expects holiday-period online sales to reach an all-time high of $207 billion from November 1 to December 31 in the US. That would represent a jump of 10% YoY. The company says it expects global online sales to reach $910 billion, also a record.
* The 30-year fixed mortgage rate increased to 3.23% for the week ended Oct. 15, according to a weekly update from the Mortgage Bankers Association. This is the highest level in six months and higher than the 3.18% during the prior week. 
* Facebook (FB) will change its name in order to reflect itself as a “metaverse” company. As a reminder, the metaverse is a shared, 3D virtual space in which people can interact with the environment and other via online avatars accessed using virtual reality technology.
* Jack MA, founder of Alibaba (BABA) was seen traveling in Europe, specifically Spain, in the first overseas trip since the government began cracking down on his companies over a year ago. 
* DraftKings (DKNG) is launching online betting operations in Connecticut

*****

# [Dow futures jump 160 points as investors bet strong profits will continue to lift market](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures gained on Tuesday as major companies continued to report strong third-quarter earnings, easing concerns that persistent Covid cases and rising costs would derail corporate America’s profit recovery.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed about 164 points, or 0.5%. S&amp;P 500 futures added 0.5% and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.4%.
*****
&gt; The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 come into Tuesday both sitting about 1% from record highs.
*****
&gt; Dow member Travelers saw its shares gain more than 3% in the premarket after the insurance company’s quarterly earnings report topped expectations.
*****
&gt; Fifth Third Bancorp shares ticked up in early morning trading after its profit and revenue beat Wall Street estimates.
*****
&gt; Procter &amp; Gamble continued the bullish trend with better-than-expected earnings, but its shares dipped more than 1% in premarket trading. The consumer products giant said it is raising prices to cover rising commodity and freight costs and warned that inflation may continue.
*****
&gt; Johnson &amp; Johnson also beat third-quarter earnings expectations by 25 cents per share, but saw its shares dip in early morning trading.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere, Walmart shares gained around 2% in the premarket after Goldman Sachs added the big box retailer to its conviction buy list, saying the stock could rally nearly 40%.
*****
&gt; As of Tuesday morning, 82% of S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported earnings beat expectations, according to FactSet. Taking into account those reports and estimates for those to come, third-quarter profit growth will come in at 30%, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; Other major reports after the bell Tuesday include Netflix and United Airlines.
*****
&gt; On Monday, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite notched their fourth day of gains. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.34%. The Nasdaq was the relative outperformer, gaining 0.84% as Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet all closed higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 36 points, dragged down by a 3% drop in Disney’s stock.
*****
&gt; While reports have been strong, investors are looking for commentary from corporate America about supply chain issues and inflation.
*****
&gt; “The financials got earnings season off to another strong start, but let’s be honest, COVID and supply chain issues aren’t going to impact this group. Now it gets very interesting to see what other industries will have to say about the health of the economic recovery,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.
*****
&gt; Netflix could set the tone for technology earnings this season. Three months ago, the streaming giant forecasted paid net subscriber adds of 3.5 million, while analysts expect about 3.84 million, according to StreetAccount. Analysts are also forecasting fourth-quarter subscriber guidance of 8.5 million, which would be the highest outlook since the first quarter of 2019.
*****
&gt; Shares of Netflix have traded lower on six of its last seven earnings releases.
*****
&gt; Earnings from United Airlines should give investors a gauge on the travel recovery from the pandemic and Procter &amp; Gamble earnings could show how strong the consumer is in the goods sector.
*****
&gt; Stocks are coming off of a winning week but have been volatile since September. Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity strategist Mike Wilson — who has been calling for a correction in the broader market — told clients on Monday that although fundamentals are deteriorating, the market seems to be resilient to a bigger pullback.
*****
&gt; “Whether we end up getting this finishing move at the index level this year or not will depend largely on retail participation, the message that 3Q earnings brings from a guidance standpoint, and the path of PMIs into year end,” said Wilson.
*****
&gt; Economic data from China weighed on investor sentiment after it reported low GDP and industrial production for September that fell short of expectations. Industrial production in the U.S. also fell for September as supply constraints continued to hinder manufacturing, the Federal Reserve reported Monday.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 18, 2021**

The market carried on its incredible momentum, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) bouncing for the fourth straight day to add to gains after experiencing the first -5% decline all year. Technology stocks, which have recently been pressured by a rising Treasury yield, came back with a vengeance, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) jumping roughly 6% from October 4 lows. Market participants are encouraged by an unexpected uptick in retail sales despite a new report showing inflation rose once again in September amid widespread supply-chain disruptions. Looking ahead, market participants continue to digest corporate earnings report, with many notable companies like Tesla (TSLA), Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), Netflix (NFLX), and Intel (INTC) among many others reporting later this week. 

Not to toot my own horn, but as I have continuously said, I continue to see any dips in the markets as buying opportunities, including this latest dip and the recent bounce highlights why. While I acknowledge current risk factors that exist in the market (China, inflation, supply-chain issues, etc), these are all issues that have been known about and have been affecting the market for months. Just because we see a sudden uptick in “doomsaying” headlines from mass media, doesn’t mean the fundamentals of the bull market in US equities have shifted (remember they are paid for you to engage with the content). Until something fundamentally changes (like inflation forcing the Fed to suddenly hike the interest rate), I continue to stick to my plan. Just be sure to be prepared for any eventuality, I do this by having zero-margin in my long-term account and adhering to stop losses in trades.

A strong start to earnings season, with big banks handily beating estimates last week, helped fuel optimism that corporate profits held up better than anticipated despite widespread supply-related disruptions. Big banks from Morgan Stanley (MS) to Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) handily topped estimates in their third quarter results last week. As a reminder, consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP. 

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DPCERE1Q156NBEA](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DPCERE1Q156NBEA)

Victoria Fernandez, Chief Market Strategist at Crossmark Global Investments said, “We started off this week really strong. The banks have done great ... That started to relieve a few people's concerns, especially when you had the CEOs of the bank saying the consumer looks strong. And that, I think, is going to be the key for the market going forward. If the consumer is there and they're willing to spend — which we've seen in the month of September \[when\] retail sales started to come back a little bit — then I think that gives a little more optimism to the market that as we continue to reopen, as earnings are strong, the consumer will be there, and the equity markets will continue to trend higher.""

Last week, The Department of Commerce released their monthly report on retail sales, which showed an unexpected rise in consumer spending in September despite supply-chain constraints. Retail sales for the month increased by 0.7%, against the Dow Jones estimate for a decline of 0.2%. Compared with a year ago, sales were up 13.9%. Still despite robust consumer spending, economists warn that supply bottlenecks will increase heading into the holiday season, as demand increases. Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets said,  “The solid retail sales report reflects both consumer resilience and escalating prices. The main concern now is that supply-chain disruption and micro-chip shortages appear to be spreading, limiting selection and tamping down goods demand.” 

As of Friday, the expected earnings growth rate for the S&amp;P 500 was 30%, according to FactSet. That figure — based on both actual earnings from companies that have reported so far and expectations for future results — represented an increase from the prior week, when the anticipated earnings growth rate for the third quarter stood at about 27.6%.

**Highlights**

* Apple (AAPL) unveiled new versions of its Macbook Pro laptops that use their proprietary M1 chip, making them more powerful than the predecessors that used Intel (INTC) chips.
* Optimism among U.S. homebuilders posted a surprise jump in October, with strong demand for homes helping offset ongoing supply chain and labor issues in the housing market. The National Association of Home Builders' October Housing Market Index jumped to 80 in October from 76 in September. This index, which tracks confidence among domestic homebuilders, was expected to fall to 75 in the latest reading, according to Bloomberg consensus data.
* Alibaba (BABA) is reportedly planning to build its own in-house chip using a 5nm wafer designed using Arm architecture in a bid to strengthen its position in the cloud computing market.
* Arm, which is the midst of a potential $54 billion take over by NVIDIA (NVDA) announced new tools aim at cutting the development time of connected devices by up to 40%. Arm on Monday released tools that it hopes will let makers of ""internet of things"" devices, from connected traffic control lights to smart home appliances, develop their chips and code at the same time, shaving two years off the typical five-year timeline to create a device. Arm is one of the most important tech companies, I recommend everyone read up on them. 
* Amazon (AMZN) hired 150,000 seasonal workers as the holiday season, the busiest of the year, kicks off.

2021-10-14 11:12:08,r/ValueInvesting,How do you compare REIT valuations vs corporations?,"If you investing in both REITs and corporations, how do you compare its valuations?

I'm asking this, because for REITs valuations people usually use Price / FFO, or dividend yield model.

For corporations, using dividend yield model is usually flawed as many SP500 companies do share repurchase.

REITs grow through rental increases, property value increases, but usually through the use of share dillution (and sometimes even to cover operating expenses in case of the high payout ratio, i.e. WPC).

So how would you determine if a slow grow company, i.e.  $JNJ has a low EPS 5 year growth is a better or worse purchase comparing to slow grow REIT, i.e. $UHT [https://alreits.com/reits/UHT](https://alreits.com/reits/UHT)

*****

&gt; # 1. Wall Street looks higher after Monday’s tech decline

&gt; * U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open Tuesday as tech stocks bounced, one day after the Nasdaq sank more than 2.1%. Monday’s session was marked by rotation out of tech names as bond yields remained elevated. The S&amp;P 500 on Monday fell 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 323 points, or nearly 1%.
&gt; * PepsiCo on Tuesday raised its full-year forecast after its quarterly earnings and revenue topped analysts’ expectations. The company’s shares were up nearly 1% in the premarket.
&gt; * Johnson &amp; Johnson said Tuesday it has submitted data to the FDA for emergency use authorization of a booster shot of its Covid vaccine for all adults. J&amp;J shares rose modestly.
&gt; * Volatility that accompanied September’s market decline continued in October, with the first two trading days of the new month up big and then down big. The Nasdaq, as of Monday’s close, was almost 7.3% away from its latest record close Sept. 7, inching nearer to a correction. The S&amp;P 500 was 5.2% from its Sept. 2 record high. The Dow was more than 4.5% away from its Aug. 16 record close.

*****

&gt; # 2. U.S. faces recession if Congress doesn’t act on debt limit , Yellen says

&gt; * Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC on Tuesday she believes the economy would fall into a recession if Congress fails to address the borrowing limit before an unprecedented default on the U.S. debt. “I do regard Oct. 18 as a deadline. It would be catastrophic to not pay the government’s bills, for us to be in a position where we lacked the resources to pay the government’s bills,” Yellen said on “Squawk Box.” On Monday, President Joe Biden urged Republican senators to “get out of the way” on the debt ceiling. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said Democrats should use their majorities on Capitol Hill to act without GOP votes.

*****

&gt; # 3. Oil prices rose to around 7-year highs after OPEC, allies moves

&gt; * U.S. oil prices, as measured by West Texas Intermediate crude, rose modestly Tuesday morning to around seven-year highs near $78 per barrel. WTI jumped roughly 2.3% on Monday as international oil producers decided to keep a cap on supplies. Despite pressure from the U.S. to ramp up output, OPEC and its allies were concerned that a fourth global wave of Covid infections could slow a demand recovery, a source told Reuters just before Monday’s vote. U.S. oil prices have surged more than 60% in 2021, bringing major energy companies along for the ride. Exxon has gained nearly 50% this year.

*****

&gt; # 4. Facebook whistleblower to testify; platform outage fixed

&gt; * Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen is set to testify at Tuesday’s hearing of the Senate Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection. After recent reports in The Wall Street Journal based on documents she leaked raised a public outcry, Haugen revealed her identity in an interview on the CBS program “60 Minutes,” which aired Sunday night. She insisted that “Facebook, over and over again, has shown it chooses profit over safety.” Shares of Facebook rose 1% in Tuesday’s premarket after closing down almost 5% in their worst session in nearly a year.

&gt; * Facebook and its Instagram and WhatsApp services are back online after a massive global outage. Facebook said late Monday that “the root cause of this outage was a faulty configuration change.” The roughly six-hour incident marked the longest stretch of downtime for the social media company since 2008, when a bug knocked the site offline for about a day, affecting around 80 million users. The company’s platforms currently have billions users.

*****

&gt; # 5. Tesla must pay ex-worker $137 million over hostile workplace, racism

&gt; * A San Francisco federal court decided that Tesla must pay a former contract worker, Owen Diaz, around $137 million after he endured racist abuse working for the company, his attorneys told CNBC. The jury awarded more than attorneys had asked for their client, including $130 million in punitive damages and $6.9 million for emotional distress. Diaz told the court that colleagues used epithets to denigrate him and other Black workers, telling him to “go back to Africa” and leaving racist graffiti in the restrooms and a racist drawing in his workspace. Diaz’s lawyers said the case was only able to move forward because their client had not signed one of Tesla’s mandatory arbitration agreements.

*****

&gt; # 1. Dow futures dropped after starting October with a strong rally

&gt; * U.S. stock futures fell modestly Monday after finishing a rough week with strong rally on the first day of October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the way higher Friday, with an advance of 482 points, or 1.4%. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.2%. The Nasdaq’s 0.8% gain broke a five-session losing streak. The tech-heavy index was more than 5.2% away its latest record close on Sept. 7. The S&amp;P 500 was nearly 4% away from its Sept. 2 record close. The Dow was more than 3.6% away from its Aug. 16 record close.

&gt; * The month of October has a reputation for volatility, but the fourth quarter has mostly been a positive time for the market. Many strategists on Wall Street expect stocks to eclipse their recent highs after a rocky period in October. The S&amp;P 500 has averaged outsized gains of 3.9% in the fourth quarter and was up four out of every five times since World War II, according to CFRA. September was the worst month in 2021.

*****

&gt; # 2. U.S. trade rep to vow to enforce ‘phase one’ deal with China

&gt; * Washington must enforce the U.S.-China phase one trade agreement, and it will raise broader policy concerns with Beijing, according to remarks set to be delivered Monday by U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai. CNBC reported last week that the top trade advisor would announce that Beijing has not complied with the phase one deal that was reached under former President Donald Trump’s administration. Tai’s speech, at 10 a.m. ET at Washington think-tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, will outline the Biden administration’s China trade strategy.

*****

&gt; # 3. Troubled Evergrande set to raise more cash from partial sale

&gt; * Indebted developer China Evergrande Group is set to sell part of its stake in its property services unit, the second asset sale in as many weeks as the liquidity-squeezed Chinese real estate giant scrambles to raise cash. Trading in shares of Evergrande and Evergrande Property Services was halted Monday morning. In a filing with the Hong Kong exchange, Evergrande said it requested the trading halt ahead of an announcement about a “major transaction.” Last week, Evergrande said it will sell a $1.5 billion stake in Shengjing Bank to a state-owned asset management firm.

*****

&gt; # 4. Whistleblower says Facebook ‘substantially worse’ than rivals

&gt; * Frances Haugen — a Facebook whistleblower who brought internal documents detailing the company’s research to The Wall Street Journal and Congress — revealed her identity ahead of an interview she gave to the CBS program “60 Minutes,” which aired Sunday night. The documents showed Facebook executives had been aware of negative affects of its platforms on some young users.

&gt; * According to her website, Haugen was a former product manager on Facebook’s civic misinformation team. Haugen previously worked as a product manager at Pinterest, Yelp and Alphabet’s Google, according to her LinkedIn profile. “I’ve seen a bunch of social networks and it was substantially worse at Facebook than anything I’d seen before,” Haugen told “60 Minutes.” Shares of Facebook, down 10% in the past month, fell nearly 1% in Monday’s premarket.

*****

&gt; # 5. Tesla beats expectations with Q3 deliveries despite delays

&gt; * Shares of Tesla — up close to 10% year to date — rose nearly 3% in the premarket after the company said Saturday it delivered a better-than-expected 241,300 electric vehicles during the third quarter of 2021. The company produced 237,823 cars in the quarter. Most were Model 3 and Y vehicles, the more affordable mid-range offerings. The rest were the higher-end Model S and X vehicles. Tesla does not break out delivery numbers by model, nor does it report sales or production numbers from China versus the U.S. In its Saturday press release, Tesla acknowledged delivery delays during the quarter, blaming them on “global supply chain and logistics challenges.” It also thanked customers for their patience.

2021-10-01 20:39:27,r/stocks,Vicarious Surgical (NYSE: RBOT) - Future Challenger and Disrupter to Intuitive Surgical's Robotic Surgery Monopoly,"**Vicarious Surgical (RBOT)** has the potential to be the first real, meaningful competition to Intuitive Surgical’s monopoly on robotic surgery with its robotic platform poised for FDA approval in 2023 with commercialization starting at that point. The company expects to hit $1B in revenue by 2027, which on a discounted basis to today assuming a similar EV/sales multiple as ISRG, would value the business today at around $5B, or 300%+ above today’s share price. Note the opportunity is highly speculative as the company has no revenue today and the platform has yet to achieve regulatory approval.

**Background**: Vicarious was founded in 2014 by two MIT engineers with the vision of creating a much more simple, effective, and nimble single port robotic system for abdominal surgeries. The company is backed by Kholsa Ventures, Bill Gates, and Eric Schmidt’s family office, with Auris (acquired by JNJ) former CFO as executive chairman. Beckton Dickenson, one of the largest publicly traded medical device companies, is also an investor in the PIPE. In September 2021, the company completed its combination transaction with D8 holdings, valuing the company at nearly $1B TEV and putting \~$200MM of cash on the balance sheet. The company’s system was granted the “Breakthrough Device” designation by the FDA, the only robotic system to receive this, which positions Vicarious for a faster approval process. Breakthrough designations are only granted to devices which make meaningful technological and patient outcome leaps relative to existing technologies and solutions. There are about 8MM shares in the free float and the remaining \~120MM in the hands of longer term institutional and founder owners.

The company is based in Waltham, MA (just outside of Boston) and currently has 33 job openings posted.

**Market:** the robotic surgery market was born primarily through Intuitive Surgical’s development of the da Vinci surgical system starting in the early 2000s, which originally was a multi-port/incision robotic system comprising of 3-4 surgical arms and a separate console. The platform grew originally from prostatectomy and hysterectomy procedures into heart, lung and other applications. The goal of robotic surgery was to advance from laproscopic procedures (minimally invasive manual surgery) toward greater precision, lower complications, and better accuracy by giving the surgeon greater control (the human hand can be unstable) and visibility (HD cameras inserted into the body). Other platforms serving other niches have been developed, including MAKO (for knee replacements, bought by Stryker), Mazor (bought by MDT), Stereotaxis (EP / cath procedures), Ascensus, and Procept. ISRG today generates nearly $5B of revenue and growing at a 20%+ rate with EBITDA margins of nearly 40%. ISRG’s surgical platforms cost \~$2-3MM each. Given this growth and share gain from traditional surgery, MDT has developed the Hugo system, JNJ has acquired Auris, and Stryker has made inroads as well.

**The Vicarious Solution**: The next stage of robotic surgery is to accomplish the same or better results but through smaller and fewer incisions. ISRG developed a single port system utilizing a 25mm incision and MDT’s Hugo system is a copy of the ISRG’s multi-port system.

Vicarious fits in by providing technology able to bring the same capabilities but into a single 10-15mm incision, which results in about a third of the size of an incision from any other single port platform. Additionally, the Vicarious system has two robotic arms and a camera that fit through a single incision, and the arms have 9 degrees of dexterity with the ability to reach 360 degrees, while other systems cannot do this.

Further, Vicarious’ system is smaller and cheaper, allowing more existing hospital ORs to adopt the technology without construction or disruption to the surgical suite. More on the technology can be found in various investor presentations by Vicarious and D8 as well as video interviews with Adam Sachs, the founder/CEO.

In short, the Vicarious system promises to be cheaper, smaller, more nimble, and offer better patient outcomes compared to the competition. The company’s investor materials point to a third party market survey showing that the Vicarious system scored in the 95th percentile in terms of customer feedback and receptivity. Mastering single port abdominal and thoracic surgery via robotics has been the holy grail of the robotic surgery market given it reduces complications, post op recovery time, etc, and Vicarious is poised to be the solution delivering better technology with a lower price.

**What’s the play?:** the company projects $1B in revenue by 2027, which would be about 3 years after FDA approval. Note ISRG is $5B today and likely to continue growing at 15-20% CAGR. Assuming the same valuation multiples as ISRG (20-25 times sales), that would work out to a roughly $20B TEV in 2027, and discounting this back to 2021 would yield a $5B net present value assuming a 25% discount rate. Today’s value is roughly $1.5B, so that is 3x today’s value. Even if you cut the company’s projections by 50%, you get a current value well in excess of today’s value.

That’s all well and good but my personal view is this company will never hit $1B in sales. Why? It will be bought before then. ISRG has $4B of total cash and no debt. Medtronic has $11B in cash. JNJ has $25B in cash. Beckton Dickenson has $3B of cash. These and many others have a strategic need to get a dominant platform in robotic surgery and ISRG at a $120B market cap is too expensive for any of them to buy out.

As soon as (or even before) the Vicarious system gets FDA approval, it will likely be bought out. Adam Sachs believes the business can be a $100B company, and I believe him given the novel nature of the technology and its capabilities.

I believe the best way to play this is via the warrants which offer asymmetric upside (trade at \~$2, which is right at intrinsic value with the share price at roughly $13.50). The warrants get dollar for dollar upside on the shares through $18 (and proportional above that), so these act like LEAP call options though with capped upside at $18 as the company can redeem them at that point in time. I own nearly 500,000 warrants, and this isn’t a quick flip position, as it would take several days to sell out of this. I owned ISRG back at $40-$50/share and sold out too soon - it is now trading at $1000.

**The Big Risks**: the obvious one is failure to achieve FDA approval. The others include the majors developing a competing option that’s even better than Vicarious, though not likely based on what is known to be in the pipeline now. Separately, there is the potential that the company needs future capital to commercialize beyond the $200MM on the balance sheet, though that should provide 2-3 years of support to get through FDA approval.

# **Markets brace for hot consumer inflation report in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/10/markets-brace-for-hot-consumer-inflation-report-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Investors are paying close attention to any reading on inflation these days, and the consumer price index will be the big one to watch in the coming week.
*****
&gt; The latest snapshot of the economy comes just a week before the Federal Reserve’s important September meeting. At that meeting, the Fed is expected to discuss more details about its plan to taper down its bond buying program, or quantitative easing.
*****
&gt; Market professionals say a hotter inflation reading could speed up the Fed’s plans to slow the $120 billion a month in bond purchases. The paring back of its asset purchase program would be the Fed’s first major step away from the easy policy it put in place to combat the pandemic.
*****
&gt; The consumer price index is expected Tuesday, and there is retail sales data is released Thursday. They are expected to show consumer prices jumped at a 5.3% annual pace in August, according to the consensus estimate from FactSet, while the consumer continued to pull back from the high spending levels of earlier in the year.
*****
&gt; # Hot CPI
&gt; “If the CPI is hotter than expected, it could make the difference between a September announcement for tapering or waiting to November,” Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said.
*****
&gt; Economists expect CPI to rise at a 0.4% pace month over month. The report comes after August’s producer price index — which was released Friday — showed a jump of 8.3% year over year, due in part to supply chain constraints.
*****
https://i.imgur.com/3ia6fMl.png
*****
&gt; The Fed’s formal announcement about tapering its bond-buying program, also called QE, is widely expected in November or December. Many of those who had expected a September announcement pushed back their time frame to later in the year after August’s employment report showed just 235,000 jobs added, about 500,000 less than expected.
*****
&gt; “Certainly the trend has been for the inflation number to come in above expectations. I think if that happens again, it will feed the narrative that high inflation is going to stick. Obviously, it’s an issue for the bond market if it’s viewed at all as accelerating the timing of the QE tapering, and or accelerating the timing of the first rate hike,” CIBC Private Wealth U.S. chief investment officer David Donabedian said. That would be a negative for stocks.
*****
&gt; “If markets have an inflation mutiny here and there’s volatility as a result, they could move it up to September,” Donabedian said of the Fed’s taper announcement. “But I think there’s kind of a one in four likelihood in my view.”
*****
&gt; # Stagflation?
&gt; That combination of higher inflation and slower spending, particularly after August’s weaker jobs report, has spurred talk about the threat of stagflation. Those worries have also increased as economists ratchet back growth forecasts for the third quarter to a still high level just above 5%, from above 6%.
*****
&gt; “I’m more about the ‘flation’ side of it than the ‘stag.’ I think the economy is going to perform fine right through next year,” Donabedian said. He said the slowdown in consumer spending after stimulus checks had boosted retail sales earlier in the year is not surprising and may be just a “short-term warning.”
*****
&gt; “We had this explosive growth in retail sales early in the year as a direct result of stimulus payments and vaccines coming and a burst of consumer optimism. It’s really settled down now,” he said. “There was an enormous amount of liquidity and saving and they spent what they spent out of that extra amount of savings and you’re going through a bit of a retracement here, which is why you’re seeing economists mark down their third quarter estimates. Consumer fundamentals are pretty good.”
*****
&gt; Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said he expects the CPI report to show that inflation is peaking, just as the Fed has said. But he says the slowing trend is not just an issue for consumer spending. It is also showing up in business spending and housing.
*****
&gt; “With where labor markets are, August was a bit of an egg. But growth in employment has been solid on average, very robust over the course of the year,” he said. “Even though employment disappointed in August, hours and and earnings were still pretty good. There’s income there for consumers to spend. We’re looking at this as a short-term hiccup.”
*****
&gt; Gapen said third-quarter economic growth may be somewhat slower than expected. However, he said some of the lost growth could show up in the fourth quarter.
*****
&gt; “It has some characteristics of stagflation, but true stagflation is rising unemployment and rising inflation. We don’t have that,” he said. “These are bottlenecks that are kind of constraining the pace of the recovery and lead to higher inflation. Demand isn’t the problem right now. Supply is. The unemployment rate is still coming down and employment is improving. It has the whiff but I wouldn’t call it stagflation.”
*****
https://i.imgur.com/tjC3emB.png
*****
&gt; Donabedian expects higher prices and shortages to continue into next year, as supply chains keep getting disrupted. Some companies, including PPG and General Electric, have already commented on how they see issues with supplies stretching into 2022. Donabedian expects to see more warnings ahead of the third-quarter earnings season.
*****
&gt; Stocks were lower this week, with the S&amp;P 500 losing 1.7% to 4,458. The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield has held above 1.3% and was at 1.33% on Friday.
*****
&gt; A number of strategists expect to see the stock market pullback during the typically choppy September and October period. Some say the Fed’s September meeting could be a catalyst, especially if the central bank sounds particularly hawkish.
*****
https://i.imgur.com/IP5Vq9T.png
*****
&gt; “We’re up over 30% in 2019, over 18% last year and over 21% in the first months of this year,” Donabedian said. “These are unsustainable rates or return. ...Our takeaway is it’s going to get tougher from here. Valuations are somewhat extended and this whole incredibly supportive policy framework is going to get a little less friendly.”
*****
&gt; # Now watch Congress
&gt; Donabedian said it will be important to watch discussions in Congress as it begins to put details around the infrastructure spending and what type of tax increases will be proposed to pay for it.
*****
&gt; “They’re going to start to fill in the blanks on where the money is going to be spent and what taxes and tax rates are going to be written into the legislation,” he said. “It’s the overall corporate tax rate, it’s the tax on foreign earned income, capital gains rates and dividend tax rate. These are big investor related issues.”
*****
&gt; He said the market has been ignoring the tax issue. “Those sort of issues went quiet over the summer but it’s back full bore over the next two weeks. It will get a lot of attention.”
*****
&gt; The tax decisions could have big implications for corporate earnings, which have been a big driver of the stock market’s gains. “One very direct way that could go wrong is if you get a large set of tax increases that go into effect in 2022. That’s a direct hair cut,” he said.

&gt; # Beige Book Decelerates As Delta Impact Widens

&gt; Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve updated its twice-quarterly qualitative assessment of the economy based on conversations with business contacts across the twelve regional districts. For each Beige Book release, we apply a natural language processing algorithm to assess the relative frequency of positive versus negative words, giving us a quantitative comparison of Beige Books over time. As shown in the chart below, our index of Beige Book activity has fallen from record levels recorded back in June to elevated but much more modest levels in September. That's consistent with the Fed's description of ""moderate"" growth thanks to the impact of the Delta variant.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/091021-Beige.png))**

&gt; In the second chart below, we show the relationship between GDP growth and our Beige Book Index from above. As shown, the current reading of our index equates to GDP growth of a bit less than 4% YoY. But keep in mind that extreme base effects are still driving wild YoY GDP readings. With that in mind, the Beige Book Index appears to be showing above-trend but decelerating growth, when accounting for base effects of the extremely low GDP reading from Q2 of 2020.

&gt; # Most Heavily Shorted Stocks

&gt; Over the course of 2021, we have seen some aggressive short squeezes, resulting in turmoil for certain financial institutions and millions in profits for some retail traders. The ""reddit army"" has gone after multiple stocks, most notably Game Stop (GME) and AMC (AMC). Let's dive into the 25 companies in the Russell 3,000 currently with the highest short interest as a percentage of float. Of these 25 companies, only 8 have experienced positive returns in 2021, and 6 have seen their share price half. Since GameStop peaked in late January, 20 of the companies on this list have lost value, and 9 have seen their equity trade down by 50%. Since AMC's peak in early June, 7 companies have seen price appreciation, and zero have seen their value decrease by 50%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/Russell-3000-Highest-SIPF.png))**

&gt; The average short interest as a percentage of float for the entirety of the Russell 3,000 is 3.46%, but certain sectors have much higher proportional short interest than others. Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, and Real Estate have the highest, while Utilities, Financials, and Consumer Staples have the lowest. High levels of short interest is a sign of negative investor sentiment, but certain sectors will consistently have higher figures due to the riskiness of their business models.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/R3000-Sector-Short-interest.png))**

&gt; To dive deeper, let's look at the average short interest in each industry. Retail, Pharma &amp; Biotech, and Consumer Services have the highest levels, while Banks, Tech Hardware, and Utilities have the lowest levels. The average short interest in the retailing industry is more than three times higher than that of banks for companies in the Russell 3,000.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/Industry-avg-SIPF-Russell-3000.png))**

&gt; Although there are many exceptions to the rule, in 2021 equities with higher short interest have generally underperformed the remainder of the Russell 3,000. The average return for equities with short interest between zero and ten percent were higher than that of equities with 33%+ short interest.

&gt; To support this, let's undergo a decile analysis. The stocks in the top 20% in terms of short interest have significantly underperformed the rest of the Russell 3,000 since GME hit its highs. While the equities in the bottom 20% of short interest have averaged a 22.23% return since January 27th (GameStop's top), the top 20% of most heavily shorted stocks have declined by 1.40% on average.

&gt; # Largest 25 Stocks in the S&amp;P 500, Now vs 20 Years Ago

&gt; Yesterday, we took a look at the makeup of the S&amp;P 500's largest 25 companies in 2021 and compared it to that of 10 years ago. Today, we will be extending the study to 2001, twenty years ago right before the 9/11 attacks. On the day before 9/11, the sectors with the largest number of components in the top 25 in terms of market cap were Consumer Staples, Health Care, Technology, Financials, and Communication Services. While all of these sectors still hold a spot in the current top 25 list, the makeup has shifted substantially. Energy and Industrials, which each accounted for 8% of the top 25 companies in 2001, now have zero representation in today's list. Consumer Staples also reduced its count from five to two.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/sector-breakdown-top-25-stocks-now-vs-2001-v2.png))**

&gt; Only four companies that made up the list of top 25 names in September 2001 remain on the list today. Those four companies are Microsoft (MSFT), J&amp;J (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Pfizer (PFE). The average return of these four equities, excluding dividends, is 221.81% with a median of 129.58%. While the turnover of this list has been high over the last 20 years, every member of this list is still in operation today, but two have been undergone mergers (Time Warner &amp; Royal Dutch Petroleum). Interestingly enough, the members of this list have approximately the same proportionate makeup of the S&amp;P 500, with only a 1.89% increase in the weightings of the top 25 stocks now relative to September 2001.

&gt; The US economy today is far different than it was in 2001. As it has changed, some companies have adapted and experienced massive growth, while others have been left in the dust. Apart from the two companies that are no longer independently publicly traded, the average return of the 25 largest companies from 2001 is 92.94% with a median return of 49.08%. Over that same period, the S&amp;P 500 has returned 310.61%.

&gt; # September Seasonal Pattern: Weakness After Mid-Month

&gt; September is the final month of the third quarter and historically it is essentially tied with August as worst month of the year. Since 1950, September is ranked last for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have fared slightly better, but historical average performance is still negative. Over the last 21 years, September has generally opened tepidly with mixed performance depending on index with Russell 2000 often rising the most through mid-month. However after mid-month, any gains have tended to fade quickly and turn into losses by month’s end. Sizable losses in 2001, 2002, 2008 and 2011 weigh heavily on average performance.

&gt; # September quarterly option expiration week: S&amp;P 500 up 13 of last 18

&gt; September’s option expiration week is up 59.0% of the time for S&amp;P 500 since 1982. DJIA and NASDAQ have slightly weaker track records with gains 53.8% of the time and 56.4% of the time respectively. However, the week has suffered several sizable losses. The worst loss followed the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. In the last eighteen years, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are tied for best record during September’s option expiration week, up thirteen times. Friday had been firm with all three indices advancing every year 2004 to 2011, but S&amp;P 500 has been down eight of the last nine since.

&gt; # What Could Happen The Rest of the Year to Stocks and Bonds?

&gt; This week in the latest LPL Market Signals podcast, Ryan Detrick and Lawrence Gillum discussed global central bank policy, recently weakening economic data, and where stocks and bonds could go the remainder of this year.

&gt; In today’s blog we will focus on their discussion on stocks and bonds.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index was up more than 20% by the end of August for the first time since 1997 and it has made a new high every single month this year so far (9 for 9). Incredibly, it made 53 new highs before August was over, the most ever. Any way you slice it, this year is historic for the bulls.

&gt; The catch (and there’s always a catch) is the S&amp;P 500 hasn’t pulled back 5% all year, with the last 5% pullback last October. Not to mention September is the worst month for stocks the past 10 years, 20 years, and since 1950.

&gt; But history says that great starts to a year tend to see continued strength the final four months. “Looking at the previous top 10 starts to a year ever, the final four months have gained eight times,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “So should we see any seasonal weakness, we’d use it as an opportunity to buy before likely continued strength.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 2021 ranks as the 6th best start to a year ever. The previous top 10 best starts to a year averaged a return of 4.0% the rest of the year, with a very solid median return 5.4%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.8.21-Blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Turning to bonds, we continue to expect higher yields due to the growth and inflation outlook, with a target of 1.75% on the 10-year treasury yield by year end. This of course could pressure bonds, as they trade inversely with yields.

&gt; From a portfolio point of view, we would keep overall interest rate sensitivity muted and favor mortgage-backed securities and short- to intermediate-maturity investment grade corporates. As a result of our higher rates call, we suggest being underweight longer maturity high grade corporates or long-term treasuries, which are more sensitive to rising rates. So sum it up, taking a more of a defensive posture as it relates to interest rate sensitivity makes a lot of sense the remainder of 2021.

&gt; Also, the potential this week for a European Central Bank (ECB) announcement on tapering could push European yields higher, which in turn could push U.S. yields higher as well.

2021-09-07 23:29:58,r/stocks,What is your typical initial investment?,"When I started trading I was trying to follow the mantra of ""don't invest more than you're willing to lose."" This resulted in sort of a max of $400-500 that I would put in per individual stock and I definitely had too many going at once to see any legit profit.

I have also read that I should have specific rules set and follow them, setting emotions aside. With this, I have set my initial investment around $1-2K as well as buying puts to hedge potential drops and/or setting Stop Limits for a % I would be willing to lose. My goal is to hit around a 20-30% ROI before selling. There are a few I've bought and plan to Hold for years, but others I would like to swing trade over the span of a few months.

The more I think about it, wouldn't it be better to put far more (10-20K) into a stock that is very likely to increase in value over time, like blue chip stocks - wait for it to drop to a 20-50 day MA, invest and look to get out when that 20% is hit.

But you can't time the market! I know, I know but stocks like MSFT, AAPL, JNJ, PG and many others aren't likely to just drop to 0 even if they do have a pullback (which is when I would buy). Plus, I would have purchased a Put and/or set a stop loss with what I'm comfortable losing.

How hard do you all go in on your initial investment and do you really need to up the ante to see consistently high returns? What are your thoughts on going in heavy on a strong stock and swing trading it?",26,14,CheeznChill,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pjwfxl/what_is_your_typical_initial_investment/,pjwfxl

Biontech has seen incredible gains this year, and while I know past gains doesn’t mean future gains, I think the company has great potential going into the future because of how much extra cash they now have. The other companies have been there for a bit longer, so maybe there’s less potential for growth since Covid is coming to a close (I hope).

2021-08-24 12:15:41,r/stocks,FDA Gives Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine Full Approval,"The U.S. gave full approval for use of the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc. PFE 2.48% and partner BioNTech SE BNTX 9.58% Monday, a move quickly followed by announcements from the Pentagon, the New York City school district and others that they would begin requiring vaccinations. The Food and Drug Administration’s approval was seen by public health officials as a key step to convince hesitant individuals to get the shot and to encourage employers to mandate it.

“Today I’m calling on more companies in the private sector to step up with vaccine requirements that will reach millions more people,” President Biden said. “I call on you to do that—require it.” The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was cleared by regulators last year on an emergency-use basis, as were subsequent clearances for Moderna Inc. MRNA 7.55% and Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ -0.43% vaccines.

I chose Coca Cola &amp;amp;amp; JNJ mainly for the dividends and them being reputable companies with a great track record. Also, they are nice defensive stocks. I chose Ford because they are my favorite automobile manufacturer and an american icon. They’re accelerating spending on electric vehicles, and with the announcement today that Biden signed an executive order to make 50% of all new vehicles electric by 2030, they seem like a great option, especially with chip shortages recovering. Spy is my favorite ETF because it’s a good indicator of the overall market, and its average APY being 13.55%. In 2020, the YTD return was 18.77%, even after a long year of the coronavirus crash. $AMD and $AAPL are just two, bluechip, very liquid stocks I like.

Apple is leading the way. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google aren't far behind. The purpose of this post is the look at how much more value the top companies have gained in comparison to to the rest of the market. As of market close today, here's the indices:

&amp;#x200B;

|Index|Price|52-week range|Highs|Lows|Off highs|Off lows|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|S&amp;P 500|$4,358.69|$3,200.05 - $4,393.68|$4,393.68|$3,200.05|\-0.80%|36.21%|

&amp;#x200B;

S&amp;P500, NASDAQ, and Dow are about 1% from its highs while the Russell Index is about 5%. All indices are way off its lows from 52 weeks ago (even more so from the bottom of the 2020 cash). Clearly the indices are doing ok. But what about the stocks in the S&amp;P500?

In this next chart, here's the value companies in the S&amp;P500 have made since 52 weeks ago (again, the gains should be much more than this since the 2020 lows).

**Marketcap valuation gained during the last 52 weeks**

||Top 5|Top 10|Top 20|Top 50|Top 100|Top 250|

|%|13.86%|3.73%|1.63%|0.44%|0.19%|0.06%|

The total value gained in the S&amp;P500 index since one year ago is $20.93 trillion! The top 5 companies contributed to about 24% of those gains and the top 250 companies contributed to basically all of it (\~86%).

As of right now, the S&amp;P500 index is now valued at $39.38 trillion, so the S&amp;P500 index has doubled in value since a year ago which is absolutely insane. Let's look at the valuations of these companies.

Top 10 includes Tesla, which is about 25% off its highs that's why you see the top 10 is -12% off its highs. Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index.

Doesn't seem much but the index is valued at almost $40 trillion dollars. Look at how much of an impact these stocks together make.

|Top 20|0.391%|0.78%|1.17%|

The top 20 companies can make a 1%+ move if they averaged a 3% increase/decrease.

So what should I get out of this?

* The S&amp;P500 is top heavy - 23% of its valuation comes from the top 5 companies. 55% of its valuation from the top 50 companies. Almost 90% from the top 250 companies.
* S&amp;P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them.
* Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD.
* Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down.
* Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season.

Hope ya'll find this useful. Good luck to all.",98,13,reggiebergst,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/op2ket/the_top_five_us_public_companies_are_carrying_the/,op2ket
2021-07-21 22:22:30,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, July 21, 2021","PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, July 21, 2021

Stocks rallied again for the second straight-day, following the worst overall days in the broader market all year. Despite fears surrounding the highly contagious coronavirus delta variant and potential inflationary pressures, it seems those risk factors were quickly priced in by the market, an encouraging sign that market participants continue to believe in the recovery of the economy and eagerly buy up any dips. Potential risks will always be present in the market, and one always has to be prepared to act in case of a downturn, but one shouldn’t make decisions based on fear. We have seen dips like this in the past before the year, yet the three main indexes continue their monster uptrend. In other news, Q2 earnings season continues and is shaping up to be another record-breaking season! Bond yields also continue to decline, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield falling close to pre-pandemic levels, a sign that market participants are increasingly less worried about inflation. 

Earnings season continued full steam ahead, with bellwethers Coca-Cola (KO), Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), and Verizon (VZ) all topping estimates, an encouraging sign that, despite tech-stocks being the market’s driver, fundamental value stocks are also growing. Netflix (NFLX) continued its multi-month streak of volatility, underperforming the market after reporting disappointing earnings, despite gaining more paid subscribers than expected. Chipotle (CMG) smashed passed estimates thanks to customers returning to the restaurant and continued strength in digital sales. 

On Monday, it seems fears surrounding the coronavirus delta variant came to a head, with LA county reinstating its mask mandate and the Japanese government reportedly discussing potentially cancelling the Olympics after a slew of infections among athletes and staff. In the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 32,300 on July 18, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. However, as I said yesterday, it is important to understand that the rising infections are broadly concentrated in areas with higher vaccine hesitancy. According to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, “There is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.” Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.

it’s unclear how the situation will play out, but I continue to urge market participants not to panic just yet. While the rising cases are concerning and very unfortunate, on the positive side, the current vaccines have so far proven effective against the delta variant and countries around the world are quickly ramping up their vaccination efforts. But as always, one has to acknowledge the risks that are present in the market. 

Q2 earnings season is shaping up to another record-setting quarter, similar to Q1 of this year. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" 

**Highlights**

* Today, Cathie Woods, CEO of ARK Investments, Jack Dorsey, CEO of Square (SQ) and Twitter (TWTR), and Elon Musk, Tesla (TSLA) CEO met today in a conference in order to discuss how digital currencies may be used in the future. I encourage people to check it out, it was very entertaining to see. 
* Apple (AAPL) underperformed the market today due to intense flooding in the Chinese city of Zhengzhou, which is home to the largest iPhone assembly plant.
* Ford (F), startup Argo AI, and Lyft (LYFT) are reportedly working together to launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in Miami, Florida and Austin, Texas later this year. At first, there will be a safety driver behind the wheel but reportedly want fully automated robotaxis by 2022 or 2023.
* Microsoft (MSFT) bought start-up CloduKnox, whose software helps companies better monitor and reduce the amount of access they provide to their cloud resources. This is another in a long-line of recent acquisitions made by Microsoft aimed to bolstered their cybersecurity following a slew of recent high profile attacks.
* Cash on corporate balance sheets has reached an all-time high, with companies in the S&amp;P 500 holding $1.9 trillion in cash, which gives them plenty of runway to issue buyback programs, increase dividends, and invest in the business

2021-07-19 22:21:41,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, July 19, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, July 19, 2021**

The market sank today, with all three major indexes falling, the largest overall drop in at least two months. The market gapped down after the remarkable rally in mega-cap technology stocks, which had been driving the market higher, paused. It seems the market is being pressured by concerns surrounding inflation and rising concerns of a resurgence of coronavirus infections among the unvaccinated caused by the highly contagious delta variant. Q2 earnings season rolls on, with more big banks and industry-leaders like Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) and Netflix (NFLX) reporting this week. So far, earnings have been encouraging but have so far not impressed Wall Street. 

Since the release of the June Consumer and Producer Price Indexes (CPI &amp; PPI), which showed price inflation growing at a higher than expected clip, the market has become increasingly volatile, not unlike what happened in mid-May, where the SPY lost roughly 4% in two or three days. The CPI, which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May’s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year’s pandemic-era lows. PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 1% in June, accelerating to a 7.3% rise year-on-year, while still reflecting base effects. Core PPI rose 5.5%. This is the fastest rate of increase since 2009. 

Concerns about the coronavirus delta variant are rising across the globe. Recently, Japan reinstated a state of emergency and banned all spectators from attending the Olympics, which are kicking off soon. In the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 32,300 on July 18, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. In response, LA country reinstated its mask mandate, with other places in the US expected to follow suit. However, it is important to note that infections in the US are concentrated in areas with higher vaccine hesitancy. According to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, “There is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.”

It’s unclear how the situation will play out, I urge market participants not to panic just yet. While the rising cases are concerning and very unfortunate, on the positive side, the current vaccines have so far proven effective against the delta variant and countries around the world are quickly ramping up their vaccination efforts. But as always, one has to acknowledge the risks that are present in the market. 

Last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave his semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress, where he largely reiterated the same thing he has been saying for months. Powell said “inflation will likely remain elevated in the coming months before moderating” and that the US economy was “still a ways” off from reaching the threshold of “substantial further progress” that would trigger the Central Bank to roll-back pandemic-era policies. In short, Powell basically said while he expects higher inflation prints in the coming months, pressures are transitory and due to pandemic era disruptions and the Fed’s goal for economic recovery have not been met. [Here is Powell’s complete testimony, but here are two of his most important quotes.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20210714a.htm)

**On the labor market:** “Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.”

**On inflation:** “Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy”.

In other news, Q2 earnings season rolls on. As of today, roughly 8% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 85% of those beating expectations, according to FactSet. It seems like this quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking season, with corporate earnings super-charged by rising demand from savings-laden consumers.

2021-07-07 17:38:11,r/stocks,I think Oncology Stocks Are A Good Place To Look Right Now,"I've been following treatment progress outside of covid treatments (finally). While I do believe there's still plenty of hype to fuel that niche, longer-term, I still feel oncology is where it's at right now. Obviously, small cap biotech stocks are exciting, high risk, etc. But look at some of the companies that [this article points out](https://pennystocks.com/featured/2021/07/07/hot-smallcap-stocks-watch-potential-cancer-breakthroughs/) and what's happened in as little as 8-18 months alone.

FATE: under $20 last year to over $120 highs this year

LGND: under $80 in Q4 last year to over $215 highs this year &amp; still over $120 this week

BEAM: under $20 last year to over $130 this month &amp; still over $100 even after pulling back

ZLAB: under $75 to over $190 highs this year and still up over $160 right now.

Even the bigger dogs like MRK is kicking it real nice right now even with the XBI ETF getting smacked.

I like the data presented on oncology drug revenue being a huge driver for the sector right now too and I'll highlight this passage:

In Deloitte’s 2021 Global Life Sciences Outlook\*, the data is even more compelling in favor of oncology companies. The firm states that “Beyond vaccines, oncology is expected to continue to be a major driver of the sector’s topline growth in 2021. Oncology accounts for six out of the 10 biggest new sales generators and four of the top 10 bestselling products. According to Evaluate, sales of COVID-19 vaccines though are expected to reach US$10 billion to US$15 billion in 2021, with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine forecast to be the top seller. Evaluate predicts that Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine will be the market leader by 2026.”

Deloitte’s data clearly demonstrates the size and scope of cancer treatments. Merk’s (NYSE: MRK) Keytruda – a cancer drug – is expected to be a $2.7 Billion drug in 2021 as far as new sales are concerned. It’s further supported by expectations of more than $16 billion in 2021 sales, overall. Bristol Myers Squibb’s (NYSE: BMY) Revlimid and Opdivo are expected to do a combined $21.5 Billion this year. You’ve also got Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) &amp; Abbvie’s (NYSE: ABBV) Imbruvica, which EvaluatePharma expects 2021 sales to come in at $7.6 Billion.

There are chart images in there too showing that the majority of the ""Biggest selling drugs in 2021"" and the ""Biggest new sales generators: Products"" in 2021 are dominated by cancer treatments.

My point: I think it's time to find new opportunities for oncology treatment stocks. There's a hot M&amp;A climate, lots of money floating in the market post-covid, and plenty of proof points to look at for reference.  Can't complain about a 5-10x in less than a year here haha.

And are on pace to an all time record 65+ million for 2021

Bottom Line Earnings from 2018: -.04 2019: .01 2020: .15  Most recent report they earned 40 cents!!! .40 on 27.5 Million sales!! Beating estimates of .13 cents on 21 million sales!

In my opinion, and that is my opinion, they will have amazing numbers until at least 4th quarter of 2021. Which means all the way thru 9/30…. At least…. If you want to say that this growth wont be sustainable beyond that, I could agree with you. At the ame time at the moment the market cap is 200 million. They are starting to make serious cash, even if the same growth isn’t expected it is safe to say the current contracts with facilities should remain in tact for at least a year till renewal? So even if they do not grow at all and make 50 cents or more per share, isn’t this a great stop? Sales did grow 164% over 1st quarter of 2020… which is understandable that this wont keep up.

At least, in the mean time I am bullish at least until $16-17

2021-05-13 19:52:54,r/stocks,Darn I've been doing it all wrong!,"So I think I figured something out.  VTI is the average stock market return which is ""hard to beat"".

I have a few ideas of stocks and or indexes that may beat VTI, but I shouldn't need 20 or 30 stocks to produce that ""alpha"" right?

I mean like people have been saying.  Are they right that a good percentage of my portfolio should be a strong base in VTI or VOO?  And then above that I can make my ""bets"" on stocks I think will outperform, but they need only be maybe 10 to 20 positions?

This way I'd have less stress instead of constantly looking for stock ideas and not risk more than a certain percentage of my portfolio?

But to me there's no point in adding stock picks that don't beat VTI even as some type of ""stability"" in my portfolio.  For example JNJ.  I see no reason now in owning it versus just VTI, for me at least.

Something like UNH or HD in my research are good picks to actually produce some alpha beyond VTI.  As are maybe MSFT AAPL etc.  Maybe NVDA too.

So I this a good approach?  Make VTI a larger percentage of my portfolio, and then make fewer "" bets"" around that to try and ""beat the market""?",12,3,apooroldinvestor,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nbmqtg/darn_ive_been_doing_it_all_wrong/,nbmqtg

2021-05-09 14:43:18,r/stocks,Stocks to hold forever?,"Hi I’m turning 19 soon and I have invested 90% of my savings since last year to have a combined net worth of little more than 13k. I currently live abroad but I expect to go back  in less than a year. I use a foreign brokerage that charges me for all the transaction and exchange rate, which is quite high. So I refrain from trading as much as possible, meaning I have to hold shares for a long time to make a sizable gain. In practice, a 2-2.5% gain would break even due to currency exchange fees and taxes mostly.

My main question is if these stocks are good enough to hold for at least 5 years. Idk if I’ll change my brokerage once I go back to the states or not, but if I decide to continue to use it I don’t have to sell anything. I currently hold the following:

- AMZN, GOOGL, AAPL, MSFT, PYPL, TSLA, HD, LOW, WMT, KO, VIG, JNJ, PG, ABT, COST, SBUX, TGT, ICLN

2021-04-27 14:49:59,r/stocks,What is going on with stock valuation right now?,"Tl;dr I want to buy stocks but everything has a P/E ratio double that of what is historically normal, what is going on and why are value ETFs long on so many overvalued positions?

Hey all, newbie question here:

I’m new to investing and learning the basics of stock valuation. The way I understand it, you start by looking at a company’s price to earnings ratio, or P/E. From moneychimp.com:

&gt; Although discounted cash flows is the correct way to value a company, people naturally like to use simpler rules of thumb. The P/E ratio is the most popular because it's easy to understand. **If you buy stock at a P/E ratio of 15, say, then it will take 15 years for the company's earnings to add up to your original purchase price - 15 years to ""pay you back"".** That's assuming that the company is already in its ""mature"" stage, where earnings are constant.

It goes on to say that you may want to buy at a high PE ratio if you expect earnings to keep increasing. 

My understanding is also that the average P/E ratio historically has been somewhere in the ballpark of 13-15. Anything below that, all other fundamentals being equal, is considered a healthy buy.

Now I’m looking into large cap ETFs (I don’t have any positions yet) and checking the valuation of their top holdings and.... I’m seeing P/E ratios *way above* the historical average. Just some examples from this morning:

AAPL: 36.42

GOOG: 37.20

MSFT: 38.96

WMT: 29.06

JNJ: 28.99

AMZN: 81.51 ?!!

TSLA: 1,158.65 ??!!?!

I get that the highest values here are tech, which may have a strong expectation to keep growing, but Tesla with a P/E ratio in the thousands? Is this normal? Is this the result of massive money printing going straight to Wall Street and inflated stock prices relative to consumer goods (and thus relative to earnings)? What is going on?

https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/26/investing/emergent-ceo-stock-sale-robert-kramer/index.html

TLDR: Emergent Biosolutions (EBS) fucked up while making doses of the JNJ and AstraZeneca vaccines, and they had to halt production of both. 15 million doses of the JNJ were ruined. The CEO sold $11.1 million worth of stock before the news hit. Although they say it was a routine sell, it might get looked into by the SEC. The stock is down 50% so far.

It might be worth looking more into for a rebound play once the volatility settles down. Right now, it sells for $64, makes an EPS of $5.67, and has a PE of 11.28. If the vaccines are a total loss, it might hurt their short term earnings, but their revenues have been increasing y/y so I don’t expect a burdening loss.

2021-04-19 22:36:41,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, April 19, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, April 19, 2021**

Stocks fell on Monday, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) retreating from record levels with the benchmark Treasury yield climbing and market participants taking profits off the table after the recent record run. Looking ahead, market participants will be closely monitoring earnings season, with many more notable companies reporting this week. 

Last week, the US reported great economic data that fuelled the current rally. According to a report by the US Department of Commerce, retail sales boomed 9.8% higher in the month of March as the economy continues to gradually reopen as more vaccines are distributed. Moreover, the Weekly Unemployment report showed first-time unemployment claims plunged far below analyst estimates. The Labor Department reported 576,000 new jobless claims for the week ending April 10. This represents the lowest total first-time unemployment claims filed since August 2020 and a sharp decline from both the previous week’s total of 769,000 and analyst expectations of 710,000. 

After a very choppy first quarter to the year, volatility has subsided considerably in recent sessions. Despite a small spike today, the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, remains near-14 month lows as equities continue higher. The VIX is known as the ""investor fear gauge,"" because it reflects investors' best predictions of near-term market volatility or risk. In general, the VIX rises during times of financial stress and falls during good economic times. It is a way to gauge the risk appetite of market participants. David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs said, “The S&amp;P 500 has reached new highs while volatility has sharply declined. Low volatility has outweighed low correlations among stocks, driving return dispersion back below the long-term average. As the U.S. moves beyond key macro events such as the 2020 election, the $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package, and peak economic activity, we expect three defining themes for markets will be tax reform, infrastructure, and pricing power.

Distribution of the Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine remains paused in the US following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered.

2021-04-18 13:29:22,r/stocks,A plea for the dividend,"Many investors nail down ""dividend investing"" to a % number. In my opinion the current dividend yield isn't even half the story of what dividend investing is about. And also I believe dividend investing is a very bad term. You're not investing in a dividend, you're investing in a company that happens to distribute some of it's profits to shareholders in cash which is called a dividend. Depending on the circumstances these realized gains are taxed, but by having realized the gains you've taken out some risk from the investment without having to reduce your stake in the company. Even if a company goes bankrupt you can have a positive ROI if you've collected enough dividends along the way.

Personally, I don't invest in companies which don't pay a dividend. This is because companies that pay a dividend know their damn purpose. If a company is committed to paying a dividend and has been doing so over a long period of time that has an effect on the management. Guess which company will use profits in a more responsible fashion for investing in the company, the one thats just throwing any profits they get into potential growth or the ones that only have 50% of profits available for investment? The dividend has a discilipining effect on the company. Some companies have hard commitments to increase their dividend every year. Often they already have a pretty high payout ratio. This commitment forces them to look for new growth opportunities and to be as efficient as possible with their expenses. Some companies don't manage to increase their profits for years yet their keep their dividend sustainable by finding ways to cut costs.

Some dividend yields are distracting, on both ends of the spectrum. MSFT for example has been an incredible dividend grower. A dividend yield of currently 0.86% may seem low now but they've been growing the dividend at such a rapid pace that the yield will increase significantly over time if they continue to do so. When I bought MSFT in 2016 the dividend yield was slightly above 2%. Now my dividend yield based on what I paid for MSFT is 3.73%. The reason the MSFT dividend yield is so low now is because the market has priced in more future growth. This goes both directions. The reason some dividend yields are so high is because the market has priced in future decline. Which is bad news for the sustainability of a dividend. XOM and T may be examples of yields that aren't sustainable like GE and KHC turned out not to be sustainable. If these companies will have to cut their 6 to 7% dividend that I don't know, but the risk of that happening is certainly higher than with a company like MSFT that is only distributing a fraction of it's profits as a dividend. Even if a company pays just a small dividend I'd take that over nothing or too much because they can grow that dividend over time and if you hold long enough the yield based on what you paid can get into ridiculous areas.

**The dividend is what keeps things real** and I don't only see it as a way of realizing profits but also as a filter to filter out bullshit companies. Sure that way some opportunities are missed but yet my dividend paying only company portfolio has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the last 5 years by quite a bit and some companies have increased their dividend significantly since I bought them (MSFT, BLK, PG, SAP, UL, JNJ heck even O managed reasonable dividend growth despite covid and an already high dividend yield). 

By holding these high quality dividend companies I have an ever increasing cashflow into my portfolio without having to sell shares and I can use that cashflow to enter new investments which then again start contributing to my dividend cashflow. I don't have to put a single thought to selling as long as I believe these companies are paying their dividend in sustainable fashion. This means I also don't have to care about market valuation as long as decreasing valuation isn't because of reasons seriously threatening the business of my companies. 

I believe this way of investing is not only more mentally endurable but also more successful in the long run compared to trading around hyper growth stocks. I realize many don't have that much money to invest and the dividends they initially get may seem laughable, but I guarantee 99+% of people that enter the stock market with a get rich quick mentally will sooner or later get beaten down badly.",350,98,Cygopat,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mtb35f/a_plea_for_the_dividend/,mtb35f
2021-04-17 21:28:00,r/stocks,What criteria do you use to justify buying a stock vs. Just owning VTI or VOO?,"Mine is usually the obvious in that I think the stock will outperform the index over either a short or long time frame.

But I'm wondering if some would also buy certain stocks as a larger holding as a defensive measure against downside loss on a certain percentage of your portfolio versus cash/bonds.

For example I can think of JNJ of course.  It's largest drawdown was around -34% if I remember correctly and it's worst year was -10%.  It's averaged a 14% return since the 80s.

So I could see it or even MSFT etc as 'protecting' a certain percentage of my portfolio in the long term whilst also offering better than a 10% return hopefully.

I don't see JNJ or MSFT crashing and never recovering, but of course one can never say never.

But in general I'm just wondering what criteria you use for deciding id like to own this stock versus just putting the money in VOO.",20,6,apooroldinvestor,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/msxaqr/what_criteria_do_you_use_to_justify_buying_a/,msxaqr

# **Concerns over inflationary pressure on earnings will test stocks in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/16/investors-look-for-hints-of-inflation-in-earnings-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Earnings will be the major focus for investors in the week ahead, as they home in on whether rising costs are squeezing margins and signaling a build in inflationary pressures.
*****
&gt; From Coca-Cola and IBM to Johnson &amp; Johnson and Netflix, investors will hear from a broad swath of corporate America.
*****
&gt; So far, with one week in, companies are beating earnings estimates by a wide margin of more than 84%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; This three-month period is the first to be compared to year earlier profits that were affected by the pandemic. Profit growth for the S&amp;P 500 is a stunning 30.2% for the quarter so far, based on actual reports and estimates.
*****
&gt; That makes it the best three-month period since the third quarter of 2010, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; # Signs of margin pressures?
&gt; Major banks, like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America reported better than expected profits in the past week.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at a record high of 4,185, a gain of 1.4%. The Dow, higher for a fourth week, gained 1.2 to end the week at a record 34,200. Nasdaq gained 1.1% for the week, finishing at 14,052.
*****
&gt; Utilities was the best performing major S&amp;P sector, gaining 3.7%, followed by materials, up 3.2% and health care, up 2.9%. Technology was up 1%. Financials were up 0.7%, while industrials were up 0.6%.
*****
&gt; Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC, said she is watching the coming week’s earnings for signs of margin pressures from higher commodity prices, supply chain issues and other cost factors.
*****
&gt; “Those big forces that are threatening margins right now don’t really apply to financials. They apply more to industrial companies, the material companies and consumer companies,” she said.
*****
&gt; “I think [sectors] like the industrials will give you color on margins,” Calvasina added. “Margins really are the big question mark going forward. I’m definitely watching and listening to see what companies are going to say about taxes.”
*****
&gt; President Joe Biden has proposed raising corporate taxes to 28% from 21% to help pay for his infrastructure plan.
*****
&gt; While the fate of the tax hike is still not clear, the increase in other costs is apparent. Fuel costs have risen sharply with a 30% rise in oil prices since the beginning of the year. Lumber prices in the futures market are at an all-time high and copper futures are up about 17% year-to-date.
*****
&gt; Calvasina said companies face a headwind and a tailwind.
*****
&gt; “Companies are saying we found new ways to cut costs. When revenues come back, margins are going to explode to the upside,” she said. “Some of the Covid-related costs will come down. Those are some of the positives.”
*****
&gt; But not every company will see those benefits. “We could start to see wage pressures come back. Rising commodity costs — increases in PPI and increases in CPI — those are negatives for margins,” Calvasina said, referring to the producer price and consumer price indexes.
*****
&gt; # Searching for hints of inflation
&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said he is also watching the margin comments carefully for impact on individual stocks, but also for what they broadly say about inflation seeping into the economy.
*****
&gt; “What’s going to be the most interesting thing about earnings are profit margins. Some companies are going to get squeezed because they’re going to see price increases and others aren’t because they can pass it on,” said Boockvar.
*****
&gt; He said he will pay close attention to whether the semiconductor shortage is showing up in tech companies’ earnings. Automakers have already taken a hit and have scaled back production due to the lack of chips.
*****
&gt; The CPI for March showed a pick-up in headline inflation to 2.6% year-over-year. A 9.1% jump in gasoline prices contributed to the gain.
*****
&gt; Some of the gains in inflation this spring are expected to be temporary because of the comparison to very low levels last year when the economy was shutdown.
*****
&gt; Other than earnings, the week should be fairly quiet. Federal Reserve speakers have taken a hiatus and are in a blackout period ahead of the late April meeting.
*****
&gt; “It’s really going to be attention shifting to earnings and the inflation story,” said Boockvar.
*****
&gt; # Economic rebound
&gt; In the past week, economic reports underscored how strong the economic momentum could be in the second quarter. Retail sales for March were up nearly 10%, and jobless claims were the lowest of the recovery.
*****
&gt; There is little data in the week ahead, aside from PMI manufacturing and services data Friday. But the markets will keep a close eye on unemployment figures after Thursday’s report of 576,000 new claims — the lowest level since the early days of the pandemic.
*****
&gt; “The large claims decline suggests that job separation rates may finally be normalizing, a good sign for April payrolls,” note Barclays economists. A surprise 916,000 jobs were added in March, and economists have said they now expect a string of reports showing payrolls are up by 1 million or more.
*****
&gt; However, Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, says it may be too early to read too much into the claims data, and the coming week’s report will be important.
*****
&gt; He said the drop in claims was driven by sharp drops in a number of states, including more than half in California and even larger percentage declines in Kentucky and Virginia.
*****
&gt; “Unfortunately, I have no confidence that these moves won’t be at least partially reversed next week,” he wrote. “Continuing claims in the special pandemic programs continue to seesaw up and down every week, with the latest reading, for the period ended March 27, being a down week.”
*****
&gt; # Watching bonds
&gt; Stock investors will also be watching the bond market, where yields declined in the past week and then reversed. The 10-year Treasury was at 1.59% Friday, after tumbling sharply on Thursday.
*****
&gt; Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year is the most widely watched bond security, as it impacts mortgage rates and other loans.
*****
&gt; “The 10-year will now trade in the 1.50% to 1.75% trading range,” said Boockvar.
*****
&gt; “It’ll break below that if inflation is transitory and it will break above if it’s proven to be otherwise,” he added. “I think we priced in the last inflation stats and then we’ll take into account what the real world is saying, from companies.”

&gt; # Four Reasons The Future Looks Bright For The Bulls

&gt; “I look to the future because that’s where I’m going to spend the rest of my life.” George Burns

&gt; The bull market continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index now up more than 10% in 2021. With stocks up more than 80% from the March 2020 lows, the reality is a well-deserved break or consolidation could happen at any time. Looking to the future, as George Burns said above, we would be a buyer of any material weakness, as we believe this bull market is alive and well as we’ll discuss more in this blog.

&gt; Here are four bullish stats we’ve found recently that indeed suggest this bull market could still have plenty of life left.

&gt; First, the S&amp;P 500 Index was up just under 6% in the first quarter, an area we’d call the sweet spot. Looking back since 1950, when the S&amp;P 500 was up between 5-10% in the first quarter, the rest of the year (so the final three quarters) gained another 12.4% on average and was higher 86.7% of the time. Compare this to when the S&amp;P 500 was up &gt;10% in the first quarter and the returns drop to 6.5% the rest of the year. Lastly, if the first quarter was negative, then the rest of the year was up only 3%. Sweet spot indeed.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Second, the December Low Indicator has bulls smiling. This was created by Lucien Hooper, a Forbes columnist in the 1970s, and it simply says that if the S&amp;P 500 closes beneath the December low during the first quarter then future weakness could be in the cards. But if this critical level holds, then higher prices could be around the corner.

&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, stocks held above the December lows in 2021 and this could mean continued higher prices, as the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 18% on average previous years when this level held and incredibly was higher 33 out of 35 years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-CHart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Third, the S&amp;P 500 was up nearly 54% in the 12 months ending March 2021, one of the largest yearly gains ever. Looking at previous times that had significant 12-month returns shows the potential for weak returns 1, 3, and 6 months later. This makes sense, as stocks could need some time to catch their breath. The good news? One year later the S&amp;P 500 was higher more than 90% of the time, with only the year after the 1987 crash in the red. “It might seem counterintuitive to most investors, but big rallies like we’ve seen tend to mark the start of bull markets, not the end, so we wouldn’t bet on this bull market ending anytime soon,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-CHart-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Lastly, overall market breadth is extremely strong. Again, this could suggest near-term there could be an exhaustion point, but this isn’t what you see at the end of bull markets, in fact, it tends to usually happen at the start of new bull markets. Currently, more than 95% of the components in the S&amp;P 500 are above their 200-day moving average, a level only seen two other times, in December 2003 and September 2009. Looking back at 2004 and 2010, 2004 saw consolidation a good part of the year, while 2010 had a well-deserved 16% correction after the huge gains off the March 2009 lows. But the key point is after extreme market breadth like we are seeing now, overall higher prices and the bull market lasted for many more years.

&gt; Looking to the future, as George Burns said, we believe it could be a bright one for equity investors, particularly when we consider the return potential for stocks compared to cash and high-quality bonds.

&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - Boom Goes the Retail Sales

&gt; After a lousy report for the month of February when freak weather across the south temporarily shut down several areas of the south, Retail Sales bounced back with a vengeance in March as vaccine rollouts accelerated and stimulus checks were spent.

&gt; The moves higher in Retail Sales over the last few months have been incredible. As shown below, while it took 40 months to make a new high following their pre-Financial Crisis peak, COVID only caused a five-month drought without a new high. From the low in April 2020, Retail Sales have bounced 50%!

&gt; Even more impressive, though, is not only are total Retail Sales above their pre-COVID peak, but they are more than 17% above that peak just 14 months ago. The second chart shows the 14-month rate of change in Retail Sales since 1992. While the post-COVID decline was the steepest on record, the 14-month gain is the highest on record. Ironically, had it not been for COVID and the stimulus it resulted in, there is no way Retail Sales levels would be where they are now.

&gt; # Growth a Market Cap Story

&gt; Last week, we repeatedly noted how there has been rotation back into growth-oriented sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. For example, mega-cap names like Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) have been some of the top performers in the second quarter whereas they were some of the worst performers in Q1. As a result of the strong performance of these names which all have heavy weights in the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), the ETF has undergone some notable price action over the past couple of weeks. At the start of April, IVW finally broke back above its 50-DMA after repeatedly failing to do so throughout March. Last week, that rally continued as the ETF also broke out above its February highs.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IVW.png)**

&gt; That sort of strong technical picture is not true for all growth stocks though. Instead, it is more of a market cap story. The Russell 2,000 Growth ETF (IWO) has been stuck in a downtrend over the past few months with another failed attempt to change that last week. Whereas IVW is extremely overbought (at least two standard deviations above its 50-DMA) as of Friday's close, IWO is trading below its 50-DMA.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO.png)**

&gt; In the chart below we show small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth through the ratio of IWO to IVW. Throughout the fall and winter, small-cap growth had been outpacing its large-cap peers as the ratio shot higher. But in mid-February, the ratio peaked and in the past month, it has more sharply pulled back as a rotation into large-cap growth has taken place. In fact, the ratio has fallen over 10% in the past month! As shown in the second chart below, there have not been many times since the two ETFs began trading in 2000 in which the ratio has fallen as sharply in such a span of time. The most recent instance was one year ago during and in the immediate aftermath of the bear market. Before that, it was almost a decade since the next most recent occurrence.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW.png)**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW-1M-Chg.png)**

&gt; With just five prior occurrences, there is not a particularly large sample size for these types of moves, but returns have tended to be strong following past times that the ratio of IWO to IVW has fallen by at least 10 percentage points in a single month. For both ETFs, returns have been stronger than their relative norms over the following weeks and months. Small-cap growth has perhaps performed slightly better on average although that is due to smaller declines following the late 2000 instance. In other words, big outperformance of large-cap growth in the past has been generally good for growth stocks.

&gt; # Sell in May??? Post-Election-Year “Worst Months” Mixed

&gt; Our Seasonal Switching Strategy, which is based upon the “Best Six Months” in conjunction with our MACD Technical Buy and Sell Signal signals, has a solid long-term track record of outperformance with potentially less risk compared to a buy and hold approach. Since 1950, DJIA’s average annual gain has been 8.5%. Over the same time period, DJIA has lost an average 0.7% during the “Worst Six Months,” May through October, and gained an average 8.8% during the “Best Six Months,” November through April.

&gt; In post-election years, the historically worst performing year of the four-year cycle (page 130, STA 2021), the “Worst Months” have not been all that bad with more positive periods than negative, but average gains over the six or four month (NASDAQ’s Worst Months are July-October) period are still paltry. It is also worth noting that the one election year with a double-digit “Worst Months” S&amp;P 500 gain, 1980, was followed by a tough “Worst Months” in 1981 (shaded in light grey in table).

2021-04-16 22:28:42,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, April 16, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, April 16, 2021**

Stocks traded higher on Friday, continuing momentum from yesterday’s record-setting close, with a batch of better-than-expected economic and corporate earnings results fueling the recent rally. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) set fresh intraday records while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) traded mostly flat. 

According to a report by the US Department of Commerce, retail sales boomed 9.8% higher in the month of March as the economy continues to gradually reopen as more vaccines are distributed. Moreover, the Weekly Unemployment report showed first-time unemployment claims plunged far below analyst estimates. The Labor Department reported 576,000 new jobless claims for the week ending April 10. This represents the lowest total first-time unemployment claims filed since August 2020 and a sharp decline from both the previous week’s total of 769,000 and analyst expectations of 710,000. 

This is great news on two fronts. First, consumer spending represents 70% of US GDP ([more info here](https://www.thebalance.com/components-of-gdp-explanation-formula-and-chart-3306015#:~:text=Consumer%20spending%20comprises%2070%25%20of,components%20of%20the%20U.S.%20economy.)) and is a key driver of economic growth. GDP is now expected to increase 6.5% in 2021 according to the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's monetary policy-making group. That is sharply higher than the 4.2% forecast made in December of 2020. Second, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members have reiterated that recovery in the labor market “remains uneven and far from complete”. To see a report blow so far past analyst expectation is a great sign the labor market is recovering in tandem with the surge in consumer spending. 

Michael Pearce, senior US economist for Capital Economics said of the consumer report, “What caught our eye was the 13.4% surge in spending on food and drink services, while clothing store sales were up by 18.1%. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, food and drink services sales are down just 5.1%, while clothing store sales are now higher than they were in February 2020. That suggests a combination of loosening restrictions and easing of virus fears linked to the vaccine rollout are driving a rapid return to normalcy.” 

Distribution of the Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine remains paused in the US following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered.

Stocks jumped on Thursday, with all three major indexes reaching fresh intraday records as market participants digested a much better-than-expected unemployment report and a sharp increase in consumer spending. The S&amp;P 500 is up roughly 5% in the month of April, led primarily by mega-cap technology and financial stocks. 

Today, the economic data released was very promising. According to a report by the US Department of Commerce, retail sales boomed 9.8% higher in the month of March as the economy continues to gradually reopen as more vaccines are distributed.

We have made the decision to proactively delay the rollout of our vaccine in Europe.” During a press briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the J&amp;J vaccine review would likely take “days to weeks, rather than weeks to months”, in order to resolve.” Despite the setback with JNJ, distribution of the vaccine remains strong in the US, with the CDC reporting more than 3 million doses being distributed per day.

Stocks traded mixed on Tuesday, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) gaining while the Dow Jones (DIA) fell modestly. Market participants are closely monitoring the pace of vaccine distribution after US federal health officials called for the pause in the rollout of the Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine and the upcoming earnings season.

In a joint statement posted to Twitter [(check out the thread here](https://twitter.com/US_FDA/status/1381925612743499778)), The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) called for a pause in the rollout of the JNJ vaccine following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered.

As earnings season kicks off, a slew of recent promising economic data has suggested corporate profits will jump in tandem with the recovering economy, especially in the sectors most heavily affected by the pandemic. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far.

**Highlights**

* Earnings season is kicking off Wednesday pre-market, with many big banks reporting earnings.
* Coinbase is set to go public tomorrow. This direct listing is going to be huge, with the company rumored to debut with a market cap of roughly $140 billion. For context, that is $30 billion more than the market cap of Goldman Sachs (GS) and Square (SQ)

I looked with portfolio visualizer and see that the largest loss was around -10% since I think 1985 and its greatest drawdown was in the 30% if I'm not mistaken.  It's return has averaged 14% since 1985 also.

So I could see how jnj may be a good moderate growth with little downside risk.

I also don’t want to just toss it into an index fund as I personally believe I’ll be able to pick the best stocks from each sector (or at least the top 25% in each sector) and outperform the general market as a whole. I also enjoy doing research on companies as it lets me stay up to date on what is driving our society from the business perspective and juxtapose that to my personal perspective.

Financials: AFL, C. (Need to do more research into this sector tbh, any suggestions would be welcome)

Health Care: ABBV. (Going to be adding MDP, JNJ, LLY, and either MRK or MRNA)

*****

&gt; # 1. Dow futures steady as bond yields rise but Nasdaq futures fall

&gt; * Dow futures were steady Wednesday even as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped to a new 13-month high ahead of the Federal Reserve’s post-meeting release of new economic and interest rate projections and Chairman Jerome Powell’s news conference. However, Nasdaq futures slumped about 1%, in step with recent pressure when bond yields rise. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Tuesday broke a seven-session winning streak, retreating from a record high close. The S&amp;P 500 also fell from a record close, breaking five straight days of higher finishes. The Nasdaq bucked Tuesday’s trend and finished higher.

*****

&gt; # 2. Powell needs to tamp down inflation concerns while defending policy

&gt; * As bond yields rise on concerns about inflation, Powell needs to convince traders that easy current Fed monetary policy won’t overheat a recovering economy that just got another Covid stimulus boost. Central bankers get a new batch of housing data to consider at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect February housing starts to drop 2.5% following a 6% decline in January. Building permits for February are seen falling 7% after January’s 10.4% gain. The Fed concludes its two-day March meeting Wednesday afternoon, with no one expecting any change in rates from near zero or any shift in the extraordinary measures designed to support growth during the coronavirus pandemic.

&gt; # 3. 15% of U.S. adults fully vaccinated; Trump touts shots to supporters

&gt; * New daily Covid cases in the U.S., down about 80% from early January, continued to fall as immunity protection increases from vaccinations and high levels of prior infection. More than 15% of the U.S. adult population has been fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, while heading in the right direction, health officials say those vaccination numbers need to go much higher to stomp out the disease, which killed an average of 1,285 people in America over the past seven days, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

&gt; * Former President Donald Trump urged people to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, saying he would recommend it to “a lot of people that don’t want to get it, and a lot of those people voted for me.” However, in a Fox News interview Tuesday night, Trump acknowledged that people were free to decide for themselves whether to get shots.

&gt; # 4. White House sets low bar for Thursday’s U.S.-China meeting

&gt; * The White House is setting low expectations ahead of Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security advisor Jake Sullivan’s first face-to-face meeting with their Chinese counterparts in Anchorage, Alaska, on Thursday. According to a senior Biden administration official, the two sides won’t deliver a joint statement and no major announcements are expected.

&gt; * Reflecting Washington’s concern about the erosion of Hong Kong’s rights, the U.S. sanctioned an additional 24 Chinese and Hong Kong officials over Beijing’s ongoing crackdown on political freedoms in the semi-autonomous city. China said the new sanctions expose America’s “sinister intention to interfere in China’s internal affairs, disrupt Hong Kong and obstruct China’s stability and development.”

&gt; # 5. Uber grants UK drivers worker status after losing labor battle

&gt; * Uber will reclassify all U.K.-based drivers as workers, in the wake of losing a major labor battle there earlier this year. Under the new designation, more than 70,000 drivers in the U.K. will get some benefits, including a minimum wage, holiday time and pension contributions. However, they won’t receive full employee benefits. In a SEC filing, Uber said its U.K. ride-hailing business accounted for 6.4% of all mobility gross bookings in the fourth quarter of 2020. Shares of Uber fell more than 2% in U.S. premarket trading.

*****

&gt; # 1. Stock futures mixed after Dow, S&amp;P 500 closed at record highs again

&gt; * U.S. stock futures were mixed Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 little changed after they both closed again at record highs to start the week. Nasdaq futures rose Tuesday, adding to Monday’s 1.1% gain, which moved the tech-heavy index to just 4.5% away from last month’s record high close.

&gt; * Stocks were able to shake off the 10-year Treasury yield holding around 1.6% on Monday and Tuesday, after hitting an over one-year high of 1.642% on Friday. Rapidly rising bond yields have recently been a drag on growth stocks as higher interest rates erode the value of future profits and compress market valuations.

*****

&gt; # 2. Fed to begin March meeting with polices under scrutiny

&gt; * The Federal Reserve, which begins its two-day March meeting Tuesday, will be watching bond yields and the latest reading on retail sales. Economists expect the government’s February data to show a 0.4% increase in retail sales following a 5.3% surge in January. With the Fed’s extraordinarily easy monetary measures during Covid under scrutiny, the nation’s central bank is set to release new economic and interest rate forecasts along with its policy statement Wednesday afternoon.

*****

&gt; # 3. Moderna studies Covid vaccine in kids; more countries halt AstraZeneca

&gt; * Moderna has started testing its Covid vaccine in children ranging in age from six months to less than 12 years old. The mid-to-late stage study intends to enroll about 6,750 kids in the U.S. and Canada. In a separate study, which began in December, Moderna is also testing its vaccine in adolescents between 12 and 18 years old. The two-shot vaccine has already been authorized for emergency use in Americans 18 and older.

&gt; * Sweden and Latvia on Tuesday joined a fast-growing list of European nations suspending use of AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine as health regulators proceed with a new review into its side effects after reports of blood clots. Germany, France, Italy and Spain on Monday said they would all stop administering it. However, the World Health Organization and Europe’s drug regulator have recommended that countries continue to use AstraZeneca’s two-shot regimen.

*****

&gt; # 4. Regulators investigating ‘violent’ Tesla crash; Autopilot not ruled out yet

&gt; * The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating what it calls “violent” crash involving a Tesla sedan and a tractor trailer last week in Detroit. Authorities have not yet said whether the electric car maker’s Autopilot, Full Self-Driving or FSD beta may have contributed to the accident. The NHTSA has previously embarked on probes into more than a dozen crashes that were thought to involve Tesla’s advanced driver assist systems.

*****

&gt; # 5. OxyContin maker Purdue proposes $10 billion plan to exit bankruptcy

&gt; * OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma is proposing a $10 billion plan to emerge from bankruptcy protection. Those efforts would include a significant boost, more than $4 billion, from members of the Sackler family who own the Connecticut-based company. Court documents show Purdue officials continued to push to maintain sales of OxyContin even as it became clear the drug was being abused. Complicated litigation is playing out in courts across the country in efforts to hold the drug industry accountable for the nation’s opioid crisis.

2021-03-11 15:08:11,r/stocks,Why does REGN Trade at 15 P/E?,"Can someone explain to me why REGN continues to go down or in general their market cap seems uncorrelated with their revenues/profits?

Their revenues have grown 16% on average over the last 5 years and have monotonically grown over the last 10 years (I.e. their revenues grow every year). Their EBT is 27-40% which on either end of the interval is quite good. They only trade at 15 P/E where plenty of drug manufactures like JNJ trade at 30.  They have not been diluting shares, their forward looking projections are optimistic, and they are well below analyst price projections (although I don't care too much for that).

They have 9 approved drugs and 8 in phase 3. I assume most won't make it from phase III to being FDA Approved but they appear as through they will be able to get something.  Are all bio stocks just hype machines?  


Overall, I am miffed by the evaluation here but I think it's because I don't know much about pharmaceuticals.

https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/pave/

TLDR; $PAVE is an interesting ETF based on US Infrastructure Development. (Speculation) Texas blackout debacle, Democrats in control of government, Pete Buttigieg is Sec. of Transportation - all point towards getting Infrastructure work done.  

(still BULLISH on $JNJ as well, have avg’d down since my last post)

--$SRE - Sempra Energy - energy company, power infrastructure, pipes, etc


After watching the madness happen in Texas, the power outages, bursting pipes and more (hope everyone in TX is doing better! &lt;3 ). It got me thinking about America’s overall infrastructure problems and the failed promises from different Presidential administrations over the years.

Here’s what I’m thinkin:

Rolling blackouts in Texas makes the rest of the country take a second-look at their power grids and deeper into overall infrastructure. There is a new political push to update America’s outdated infrastructure after decades of neglect (https://infrastructurereportcard.org/). This also has potential to create new jobs and help recover from COVID’s impact. It’s really such a win-win idea to help our country in an area we desperately need an overhaul. IMO the only thing holding work like this back is ‘politics’.

Biden and Democrats would love to pass legislation like this while they have a majority. Even Trump wanted to get infrastructure work done, so there would/could/should be support from some Republicans as well. Pete Buttigieg is a young-gun in the Democratic party, has shown willingness to tackle big challenges - he would love to get his name attached to a large and historical infrastructure bill. IMO, one thing holding it back is the GOP not wanting to let the Democrats get a ‘win’ by passing (more) historic legislation. 

https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/state-us-infrastructure

‘from roads and bridges to freight rail and ports to electrical grids and internet provision. But the systems currently in place were built decades ago, and economists say that delays and rising maintenance costs are holding economic performance back.’

This is purely speculation. I am an idiot. I really hope we get some work like this done during the Biden administration and want to support American companies at the same time.

2021-03-08 07:31:16,r/stocks,I think people are sleeping on $PFE real bad,"**The DD:**

PFE is expected to gain $15 billion in increase revenue because of the covid vaccine in 2021, which is a 20-30% increase in revenue. I don't think this is priced in yet.

**The Trade:**

Buy long dated calls. PFE volatility is super low and calls are cheap AF. I bought 50 delta September calls for \~$200.

**Now expanding on this:**

\- Yes PFE stock price shot up and back down in December, bc of the news of FDA approval. People got scared out of their positions and the price dropped way wayyy back down, and its at a solid support to buy from right now.  high upside, low downside at this point.

\- The operational costs, and research &amp; development costs were priced in last year, (for the most part). This is why they had low earnings last year. They had the upfront operational costs for the vaccine, but they had no actual revenue yet, bc the vaccine had not been distributed.

\- Expected 2 billion doses to deliver by end of 2021, but may change if additional contracts are signed. So there is even more potential revenue growth. The revenue growth will probably peak in 2021 and taper off in 2022. However, the view of Pfizer CEO Dr. Albert Bourla is, "" I think COVID has a very good chance that could completely transform the revenue and earnings trajectory of this business starting now.""

\- There is a ton of negative attention on PFE stock right now. It seems to be nothing to do with the fundamentals, but just the fact that the stock is boring and not moving. But there has been the idea floating around that the covid vaccine isnt a money maker. I actually thought this myself before i started to research it.  Here is some of the ridiculous negative comments [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnowlf/why_did_game_changing_vaccine_stocks_like_pfe/)

\- Diving a little deeper into the trade idea. Buying calls is a brilliant play and credit goes to an article I read by Trevor Soare. PFE is sitting at a historic lows of implied volatility (IV). This means calls are cheap. Next earnings will be in 2 months, so there will be an increase in volatility up until that point. So my calls will gain value even if the stock price doesnt move. This will also provide some cushing even if the stock price does go down.

\- Micheal Burry has 15% in long calls on PFE. However noteworthy, Warren Buffet did exit his PFE position last year.

2021-03-03 23:06:27,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, March 3, 2021.","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, March 3, 2021**

Stocks fell for the second straight day, with technology stocks dropping sharply as the Treasury yield ticked higher once again. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.3%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 2.7%, the second consecutive decline for the tech-heavy index. The Dow Jones Industrial Average held up better, edging down 0.4%.

President Biden said his administration expects to have enough COVID-19 vaccines for any adult that wants it by the end of May, pulling the targets two months closer than the previous government estimate. As a reminder, over the weekend, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s (JNJ) single dose vaccine received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), making it the third coronavirus vaccine available in the US, following Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA). Drugmaker Merck (MRK) announced it was going to help Johnson &amp; Johnson produce its coronavirus vaccine. 

In other news, lawmakers in the Senate are set to begin debating President Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus, which was passed by the House of Representatives recently. Democrats are racing to push the legislation forward before the mid-March expiry of augmented Federal unemployment benefits. Republicans do not support the bill because of its size, but through a process called reconciliation. Reconciliation is a way for Congress to enact legislation on taxes, spending, and the debt limit with a simple majority (51 votes, or 50 if the vice president breaks a tie) in the Senate, avoiding the threat of a filibuster, which requires a 60 vote supermajority to overcome. Because Democrats have 50 seats in the Senate—plus a Democratic vice president—reconciliation is a way to get a tax-and-spending bill to the president’s desk even if all 50 Republicans oppose it

The likelihood of more stimulus and widespread business reopenings as the vaccine is distributewd has raised the specter of both speedy growth in the U.S. economy and rising inflationary pressures. Last week's jump in Treasury yields – with the benchmark 10-year yield reaching a one-year high of 1.61% – remains fresh in the minds of investors, who have been eyeing the rise in interest rates as a possible hindrance to the recovery and deviation from last year's ultra-low borrowing costs backdrop. The 10-year Treasury yield currently sits at 1.48% at the time of writing.

2021-03-03 02:30:08,r/stocks,What is a good way to go about growing your portfolio while trying to diversify?," So, yes I’m another person asking for advice. Hear me out though. 

I’ve watched and read what I’ve been able to do far. I have placed $4000 into the market. I did my best to diversify and to invest in things that are safe. Full disclosure, I have money in two penny stocks that I really believe in. Otherwise I bought into Tesla my only blue chip, among a bunch of others like KO, JNJ, COST, PM and an ETF. 

My real issue is that after a month I haven’t seen any kind of fluctuation. I blame this on the fact that my $4k didn’t go very far and I’m purchasing only 1 or 2 shares in each company. I figured any returns I make I would put back into the companies but I see this as taking a fair amount of time before I have enough stake in each stock to have a good chance of any worthwhile return. 

What can I do to get myself started in order to grow my portfolio? Or is it really a long waiting game where I have to continually put my paychecks in until I have maybe $20k invested at which point I can sit and ignore the market until I open up my fidelity app and see there’s some sort of return where I can reinvest?

2021-03-01 17:17:39,r/stocks,All you need to know about JNJ’s vaccine,"While you were debating blueberry smoothie vs. greasy b/e/c on Saturday, the FDA authorized Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine for emergency use. 

Game = changed. The federal government expects to distribute 100 million doses of the J&amp;J vaccine by the end of June, starting with 4 million this week. On top of the doses provided by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, that means a vaccine will be available to every American adult who wants one by the end of July. 

J&amp;J’s vaccine is only one dose and can be stored at normal refrigeration temperatures, so it’s ideal for use at drive-thru vaccination sites and with “transient population groups,” such as those on college campuses. 
It’s the Covid era, so you know there’s a “but.” The US is still dealing with new Covid-19 variants, particularly B1351, and the decline in case numbers looks like it’s plateaued. Plus, the J&amp;J vaccine’s effectiveness rate is a bit lower than the other two, so public health authorities are worried about people dismissing it as a second-rate option. 

Bottom line: The vaccine works really well and health leaders encourage everyone who’s eligible to get it.

It provides services and products for the consumer, pharmaceutical, and medical devices and diagnostics markets globally. Johnson &amp; Johnson is a parent company for over 250 subsidiaries. Together, the companies make up “the Johnson &amp; Johnson family of companies.” 

 **Recent History:** During our fight against COVID-19, Johnson &amp; Johnson has been working closely with its own vaccine trials for the past few months. The hard work and due diligence of its scientists led to the recent FDA approval of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine last week. Because the vaccine requires only one dose, it will help protect 100 million people and will take effect more quickly than the two-dose vaccines.

In a statement, the agency said it has notified the company and federal officials involved in vaccine distribution so that they can prepare to ship the vaccine shortly. The FDA may issue an emergency use authorization as soon as Saturday, with the first few million doses — of a shot that is relatively simple to store, handle and administer — distributed next week.

2021-02-24 23:12:34,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, February 24, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, February 24, 2021**

Stocks rose on Wednesday, with each of the three major indices closing the day positive. Shares of technology companies, which were hit the hardest by the pullback, shook earlier losses, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) closing 0.82% higher. 

In the past week, the rotation from high-flying growth stocks into cyclical and value investments picked up steam as fears of higher Treasury yields pressured stocks across the board this week, with higher prices and increased borrowing costs for companies seen as an emerging threat for high valuation companies. 

During his semiannual testimony on monetary policy, Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell said that rising Treasury yields are, “a statement of confidence on the part of markets that we’ll have a robust and ultimately complete recovery”. As a reminder, Treasury yields are the total amount of money you earn by owning U.S. Treasury bills, notes, bonds or inflation-protected securities. The U.S. Department of the Treasury sells them to pay for the US debt and when the timeframe of the note expires, the government pays back the face value plus states interest. Essentially, Powell is saying that Treasury yields are going up because investors believe in the US’ ability to pay back the interest of those yields when the time expires, which implies the economy will recover.

In his remarks, Powell reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve was looking to maintain its current accommodative policy posturing for the time being, keeping benchmark rates near zero and asset purchases at the current pace of $120 billion per month. He said, ""The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. We will continue to clearly communicate our assessment of progress toward our goals well in advance of any change in the pace of purchases."" Supportive monetary policy from the Federal Reserve is one of the reasons we think the factors are in place for a sustained bull market even after the pandemic is over. While there are certainly short-term headwinds in the market, our long-term outlook remains bullish.

**Highlights**

* Incredible, in the last few hours of the market, “meme stocks” like AMC and Gamestop (GME) gapped up strongly. Including after-hours movement, GME is up more than 120% on the day at the time of writing. This really is Psycho!!
* President Joe Biden will sign an executive order on Wednesday aimed at addressing a global semiconductor chip shortage that has forced U.S. automakers and other manufacturers to cut production. The order will launch a 100-day review of supply chains for four critical products: semiconductor chips, large-capacity batteries for electric vehicles, rare earth minerals, and pharmaceuticals.
* After the recent pullback in Tesla (TSLA), Cathie Woods, portfolio manager at ARK Investments, upped the bet on Tesla by $121 million in her ETF ARKK, the top-performing ETF of last year. We’re huge fans of Cathie Woods here at PsychoTrader, we pay attention when she does something. We think you should as well. 
* U.S. new home sales jumped by 4.3% in January over December, the [Commerce Department reported Wednesday ](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf)morning, far exceeding expectations as a jump in housing market activity last year extended into the beginning of the new year. We have been banging the table on mortgage REITs for a while now, still way below pre-pandemic levels and a great long-term opportunity in our view.
* The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said Johnson &amp; Johnson's (JNJ) single-shot COVID-19 vaccine appeared safe and effective in trials, paving the road for the third vaccine to receive emergency use authorization in the US.
* Despite a recent video showing one of their engines catching on fire, shares of Boeing (BA) gapped up today.
* Dell Tech (DELL) target raised by JP Morgan (JPM) from $85 to $90 at Overweight. Stock currently around $80
* Intuit (INTU) with two target raises. Stock currently around $400

2021-02-23 19:17:42,r/stocks,What is your opinion about SUSL? What do I need to look for in a ETF?,"I want to diversity my portfolio so I started looking into ETFs and found this ETF called ishares ESG MSCI USA leaders. The ticker is SUSL. It’s a relatively new ETF. It was started in 2020. It’s basically takes all the companies that rank highly on the ESG fund rating. 

One reason it was more attractive to me than say SPY, VOO and other etfs is that it’s relatively very cheap and the quantity I get for the same investment is higher.also with the world moving towards more stringent environmental policies I think that ESG oriented shares will grow at a faster rate. Looking it up on ishares.com the total return from inception is 20.23 percent. Which I believe is good. Some of the Holdings as of 2021 are Microsoft, google, Tesla, JNJ, Visa, nivida, Disney, PG and MasterCard with Microsoft holding 10 percent weight. Basically most of the companies in SPY. The chart is also very similar in movement with SPY. 

It’s also attractive because it seems to have similar returns compared to SPY for let’s say 10,000 dollars investment. Based on the information available on yahoo finance spy closed at 322.42 on feb 24th 2020. SUSL closed at 56.60. If $10,000 was invested in SPY on feb 24th 2020 then today the return would be 1652 dollars. The same for SUSL would be 1628 dollars. The difference is 24 dollars. Even the dividend returns is similar. For 10000 dollars you get around 27 SPY and 156 SUSL. based on Nasdaq SPY gave out $5.691 and SUSL gave out  $0.896 respectively per share in the whole of 2020. Assuming the same dividends are given out in 2021 then Spy earns 153 vs 140 for SUSL. 
The difference is 13 dollars. 

I understand SPY and SUSL are not the same because the holding percentages  are different and the volume for SUSL is considerably low. SUSL volume is consistently below 25k where as spy has a volume of around 50 million. But chart wise the movement and growth seems to be similar. 

I am not saying SUSL is a better investment than SPY. Honestly I know the above information is not enough to make a decision. I like the fact that I get more shares for SUSL while gettomv similar returns but What else do I need to look at to figure out if SUSL is good or not? Does having low volume hurt?",8,3,CptIskarJarak,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lqp24f/what_is_your_opinion_about_susl_what_do_i_need_to/,lqp24f
2021-02-23 17:50:57,r/stocks,My new strategy for monitoring my positions,"It's important to be as prepared as possible for major shifts in the markets but when you hold a large number of stocks in your portfolio, it can be difficult to stay on top of it all.  It's important to know at any point in time which stocks are your untouchable long term holds, which ones are your short term plays, which ones you'd like to hold but are willing to part with, which ones would be first on the chopping block if you want to trim positions or raise cash, etc.  I recently started using a new strategy that I've found very helpful.

What I do is I keep all my holdings in a spreadsheet and I rate them all on three criteria out of 10 for a total score out of 30.  The three criteria are:

1. Confidence: This is a subjective assessment of the safety of the position - how confident I am that it will hold its value, or gain in value, in the future.  A low score would be given to high risk speculative plays, while a high score is for the stocks I don't worry about at all.
2. Growth potential: Does the stock have multi-bagger potential?  How much room does it have to appreciate?  This is based largely on the stock price and the price relative to the stock's trading history, but also takes into account the growth nature of the company itself.  Something like PINS scores very high, while JNJ gets a low score.  Something that has already appreciated a lot, like ROKU, might get a mid-range score.  Upside potential is limited when a stock is trading at $400.
3. Chart strength: This is more of a moment-in-time assessment of how strong the stock is performing so I can quickly assess which ones are performing well and which ones are showing weakness.  The strongest charts get the highest scores.

On a weekly basis I will go through the list and update the scores so I get a weekly snapshot of my portfolio.  Stocks that score lower are the ones on the chopping block if I decide to sell.  I've only been doing this for a few weeks now but so far I find it really helpful.",13,7,SirGasleak,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lqmyzc/my_new_strategy_for_monitoring_my_positions/,lqmyzc

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-23-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Nasdaq set to sink again as Big Tech slide continues

&gt; * U.S. stock futures were mostly lower Tuesday, pointing to a 1.4% decline in the Nasdaq, one day after the index sank nearly 2.5% in its worst single-day drop in almost a month. Tech stocks continued to slide in Tuesday’s premarket, with Apple down another 2% after closing lower by nearly 3% Monday.

&gt; * Dow stock Home Depot dropped 2% in premarket trading on worries that Covid pandemic sales gains won’t last. A stock drop of that magnitude would put a major dent in modest year-to-date gains.

&gt; * The S&amp;P 500 on Monday fell almost 0.8%, in a fifth straight decline, its worst losing streak in nearly a year. The Dow Jones Industrial Averaged bucked Monday’s downdraft, closing slightly higher. It’s doing so again Tuesday morning. All three stock benchmarks remained stronger for the month.

*****

&gt; # 2. Bond yields have been rising ahead of Powell’s testimony this week

&gt; * As part of mandated semiannual economic testimony, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell goes to Capitol Hill twice this week, appearing Tuesday before the Senate Finance Committee and Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee. Rising bond yields and accompanying inflation fears are adding a higher level of interest around Powell’s remarks. The 10-year Treasury yield, which moves inversely to price, was slightly lower Tuesday morning,. But it’s been rising lately and trading around 1.36%. It was as high as 1.39% on Monday, the highest level in about a year.

*****

&gt; # 3. B/itcoin sinks below $50,000; Tesla shares drop again

&gt; * B/itcoin plunged 12% Tuesday morning, sinking below $50,000. The world’s largest digital currency, still up 60% this year, hit an all-time high over $58,000 on Sunday. Price swings of more than 10% are not a rarity in c/rypto markets. B/itcoin once climbed to almost $20,000 in 2017 before shedding 80% the following year. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday warned about those wild swings.

&gt; * Shares of Tesla, which earlier this month revealed an investment in b/itcoin, fell another 6% in Tuesday’s premarket. The stock sank more than 8.5% on Monday, in its biggest drop since late September 2020. To be sure, other tech stocks also suffered heavy losses Monday. Ahead of trading Tuesday, shares of Elon Musk’s electric auto maker was up just 1.25% this year. However, over the past 12 months, Tesla was up nearly 300%.

*****

&gt; # 4. Home Depot, Macy’s report better than expected quarterly results

&gt; * Home Depot’s fourth-quarter earnings and revenue surged past expectations Tuesday, as consumers continued to invest in their homes due to the pandemic and strength of the real estate market. However, shares dropped on comments from Home Depot’s CFO, questioning how long the pandemic would last and how that may influence consumer spending.

&gt; * Shares of Macy’s rose more than 3.5% in the premarket after the retailer Tuesday morning reported its first quarterly profit in a year. Revenue in the fourth quarter also beat estimates as the company’s efforts to cut inventories during the holiday quarter and rely less on deep discounting paid off. Ahead of Tuesday’s trading, Macy’s shares were up 35% this year, though they struggled over the past 12 months.

*****

&gt; # 5. Electric automaker led by ex-Tesla engineer to go public

&gt; * Electric vehicle maker Lucid Motors plans to go public at an $11.75 billion combined equity valuation through a reverse merger with a blank-check company. The deal between California-based Lucid and C/hurchill C/apital Corp IV is the largest in a series of such tie-ups involving EV companies and special purpose acquisition companies, better known as S/PACs. Shares of C/CIV fell more than 30% in the premarket. But speculation about the deal pushed the S/PAC stock up 470% this year alone. Lucid is led by ex-Tesla engineering executive and automotive veteran Peter Rawlinson.

2021-02-18 02:47:43,r/stocks,BULLISH on $JNJ,"Long time; first time

TLDR; I like the stock. I like 1 shot. I like easy logistics. I like tested against variants. I like high protection against ‘prevented deaths and hospitalizations’. I like potential up-swing with vaccine approval. Don’t like lower overall effective % vs competitors. Don’t like rumored production limitations.





First off, I hope everyone out there is staying safe during these crazy times. I’ve been learning a lot from being a lurker on here these past few months of quarantine/semi-quarantine life.

Now, let’s get to the point. I’m BULLISH on Johnson &amp; Johnson ($JNJ). A bluechip, long-standing American-based company founded in 1886, no.37 on F500, huge portfolio, nice dividends - shit ain’t goin’ anywhere. 

In my opinion, JNJ’s upcoming vaccine will be a big step in the battle against COVID worldwide. I believe it has a lot of upside versus its competitors. JNJ has a large pool of resources and plenty of support from the Biden administration.

JNJ’s vaccine is currently awaiting emergency authorization approval (hopefully by the end of the month), but everything seems to be looking good and vaccines are already being produced with partner $EBS. JNJ’s vaccine has a lot of advantages in the production/logistics dept., which is currently a problem for other vaccines. Things things I like:

-Vaccine takes only 60-70 days to produce (Pfizer is 110 days)

-JNJ vaccine can stay in STANDARD FRIDGE temperatures for 3 MONTHS (compared to sub-zero vaccines)

-JNJ says 100m vaccines by this summer, probably making millions/billions more in foreseeable future (rumored production limitations)

-SINGLE DOSE, easy logistics

-More effective versus variants

-65% effective overall but 85% EFFECTIVE PREVENT SEVERE CASES

-Worldwide demand

-JNJ taking same technology for vaccines/trials fighting against Ebola/HIV/Zika/more

$JNJ and a lot of the healthcare industry are currently trending upward. I’m hoping it runs up short-term with vaccine approval later this month. Long-term BULL attitude as well, taking COVID vaccine tech and fighting other diseases. Safe investment, good dividends, potential short-to-mid term upside. 

There is also a lot of MSM support with strong projections:

https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/johnson-johnson/jnj/


This is purely speculation. I am an idiot. I just want us all to be safe, happy and make tendies. 

Currently poor-ish and in for 10 @ 163. Hopefully buying more.

2021-02-16 01:55:26,r/ValueInvesting,Vertex Pharmaceuticals $VRTX Why THIS is the Best Value and Growth Stock in the ENTIRE Market,"In the stock market there are tons of stocks. Tons of super growers with expensive valuations, tons of slow growers with very nice valuations. But its hard to get both

If you ask me, the single best stock in terms of growth to valuation ratio is $VRTX

To begin, this stock is at such an incredible discount because most people dont understand how most biotech stocks work, or just find them to be too complicated to value

I am a PA student so I hope I can help you understand the business model a little bit better. Vertex pharmaceuticals is a company that focuses on finding cures for some of the most complex diseases on Earth. This is different from some other drug companies like JNJ who focus on low margin, easy to produce medications like Tylenol.

Vertex' biggest success is, of course, developing the best medications available for Cystic Fibrosis. This is due to defective Chloride channels (protein) within the body. They have total control over medications in this field. Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a disease where the body is unable to create secretions. One of the most troubled organs becomes the lungs, where your body is constantly secreting mucus to fight off harmful bacteria. In people with CF, their body cannot produce this mucus and thus typically present with terrible infection, and face possible death

The medications that VRTX produces to treat CF are called small molecule medications that, when introduced to the body, interact with the defective proteins, folding them into correct and working orientation. Truly amazing technology.

While the CF business for Vertex has grow very quickly, doubling revenues consistently over the past few years, many investors are wary of Vertex' lack of diversification across their medication portfolio.

As it turns out, VRTX actually has 7 medications in their pipeline in both clinical and preclinical phase trials.

I would like to say one more time, VRTX is not in the business of producing many easy medications for small margins, they're in the business of producing groundbreaking treatments, for HUGE margins (VRTX currently has an over 40% profit margin).

Some of the medications in their pipeline aim at treating sickle cell anemia and beta thalassemia through CRSPR technology (fell free to write back asking for more information), pain, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and more.

What this indicates is that VRTX is exploring many more treatments, and using CF medication revenues to finance operations. Not all of the diseases listed above will lead to medical breakthroughs, but it only takes 1 in order to take Vertex from holding a monopoly on 1 medication industry, to now Vertex holding a monopoly on MULTIPLE industries.

Great, so that was the POTENTIAL for VRTX and where the growth will be coming in for the company, but discussing the valuation for VRTX is extremely exciting.

As I already mentioned, VRTX is a company that many investors may shy away from because they might not know how the company works.

But using the information above, while comparing the fundamentals, Vertex has a forward and trailing PE under 20 (meaning less than the average for the rest of the market). I already mentioned they carry 40% margins. And they have 12% of their entire company in cash ($7 billion). Not to mention, virtually no debt ($946 million).

In their last earnings call, VRTX made it clear that they would be looking at possibly using that superb balance sheet to acquire some late stage medications and/or their respective companies. In other words, VRTX understands they need to diversify their own portfolio, and are making moves to do just that.

Vertex is an extremely profitable company with potential coming from all ends. Usually stocks like these trade with PE ratios over 100+, but VRTX is trading at less than average. If you ask me, this is the biggest sleeper stock in the entire market.

2021-02-13 18:16:02,r/stocks,Critique my strategy,"So I just wanted to get some feedback on my strategy. Background: 30 married, 2 kids, self employed. Through my SEP alone I'm able to put a pretty good amount in yearly, plus I save additional from my salary. Liquidity is pretty important incase I ever need the money (you never know being self employed). Not shown is cash account, I also allocate cash monthly for an emergency fund.

I broke it out it out into what would be 2 different accounts, one ETF's and the other dividend (I understand there is overlap here)

So the ETF account would hold:

1. SPY
2. ARKK
3. IWM
4. VGT
5. XLV
6. YOLO (this could be a shorter term investment)
7. VWO

The dividend account would have:

1. MMM
2. KO
3. IBM
4. JNJ
5. T or VZ
6. XOM
7. BKH
8. LEG
9. JPM or PBCT
10. HD

Thought process being ETF account would focus more on strong growth over the next 30 to 40 years and then put into something else when I ""retire"". The dividend account would be reinvested and focus on the income stream it produces in the future, making it a livable amount by the time i'd 60ish.

With both account, I would just buy more ever month or whatever, never worry about the short ups and downs. I'd save some cash incase we have major corrections I have more buying power.

2021-02-09 18:15:16,r/stocks,Non-Tech Stocks to Diversify Your Portfolio,"So I've gone through countless threads and done a bit of research on this topic these past several days as I've realized that maybe having a 100% tech portfolio is not a great idea. I'm sure that some of yall have thought about this as well considering that a lot of people here probably started investing during 2020 and tech stocks were and still are all everyone is talking about. So here are some great non-tech stocks you can open positions in to diversify a little bit.

&amp;#x200B;

**ABT (Abbott Laboratories)**: One of the biggest medical companies in the world, been around for a long time, founded in 1888. HUGE supplier of covid testing.  They make Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. The Company focuses on cardiovascular, diabetes care, diagnostics, neuromodulation, nutrition and medicine. Beat earnings in every quarter of 2020. 

**NIKE**: A staple in so many different industries. Pro sports, high school and college sports, sneaker culture, clothing, fitness, etc. They're not going anywhere.

**PAWZ (ProShares Pet Care ETF)**: people love their pets. simple. Up 67% in the past year.

**TMO (Thermo Fisher Scientific)**:  ""Company that dominates the biotech supply chain. Their products will be seen in every single lab all over the world. You want to run a gel, isolate DNA/RNA, proteins, want to buy fluorescent probes, dyes, standards, want to run western blots, run mass spec sample preps, hell - do you want to buy a mass spec instrument? They have got it all. Pays a small dividend too. They are obviously struggling in the sequencing space, which is dominated by illumina. DNA synthesis also seems to be burgeoning in smaller companies such as IDT or trilink. But TMO has a good coverage for all sorts of lab needs."" -u/Nosemyfart

**TGT (Target)**: Eigth largest retailer in the US. Analysts seem to like it more than walmart and costco. tbh you could probably just throw walmart, target, costco, caseys, etc. on a dartboard and buy whichever one you hit.

2021-02-05 00:17:52,r/stocks,The $JNJ vaccine will get emergency authorization during the next two weeks at some point," I compared the charts from the two weeks prior to moderna and pfizer approvals. In those two weeks  there was a \~10%  increase in stock price in case case of PFizer, and more than that in  the case of Moderna. Since JNJ is a company similar in size and structure to Pfizer I  think a \~10% increase can be achievable here in the next two weeks. So I  bought some today at 160$ and I hope I can sell some at \~172$ at some  point during the next two weeks. Also it went down on  the day of approval for the other pharma companies and I probably won't  wait until the actual approval date.

2021-02-01 23:29:49,r/ValueInvesting,2 Current Value Stock Ideas,"I have found it hard to find worthy value stocks in this market, but today started two positions I wanted to share and would love feedback. I have been salivating looking at the FASTgraphs on these two, but I'm not sure if Im allowed to post screenshots of those here. 

ABBV (opened full position at $102.5)- yielding 5.1% currently with a strong track record of dividend growth (average annual dividend increase over past 5 years is 22%); price is depressed primarily over Humira patent expiration in 2023. However, it seems like management has done a pretty good job at preparing for this. They continue to grow earnings from other drugs and it looks like from my research they will be able to sustain strong earnings for years to come in spite of patent expiration. Average consensus fair value I have seen is $154.

ANTM (opened full position at $293) - yielding 1.5%, but looks really cheap when compared to forward earnings. Would benefit from government subsidized OBAMAcare expansion because that is where most of their profits are coming from. I didn't realize this, but apparently OBAMAcare essentially farms out Medicare and Medicaid to private insurers and foots the bill. Anthem is one of the companies which has benefited enormously from this, but will likely see even larger numbers of Medicare and Medicaid enrollment in the next few years. Motley fool has a price target of $370 on it; other more conservative price targets I've seen are $336 and up.

Other value stocks I already have positions and am currently adding to include ENB, MMM, JNJ, UNM, PRU; adding to STAG anytime below $30, adding to MDT below $105; sold IRM with short squeeze but will add at $30 and below",12,3,jus-being-honest,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/lag5m1/2_current_value_stock_ideas/,lag5m1

2021-01-30 22:55:48,r/ValueInvesting,Alternatives to market-cap weighted value factor investing in ETFs,"Anyone here consider alternatives to market-cap weighted ""value"" or quality factor investing? What if you still seek to find good, conservative investments instead of trendy growth stocks or strict market-cap weighting but don't believe in the value factor as calculated by MSCI or CRSP -- is anything else out there? The answer is yes. One is a well known RAFI ""fundamental"" weighted index (this is available for a few markets but let's just discuss US large caps):

Schwab Fundamental U.S. Large Company Index ETF

FNDX: [https://www.schwabfunds.com/products/fndx](https://www.schwabfunds.com/products/fndx), over $5.6b AUM. Huge.  I think Schwab robo-advised accounts are auto-invested into it.

Unique set of holdings: AAPL at the top, like most market-cap funds, but it's followed by XOM and JPM. Really heavy on energy and financials overall. It's been great in the rebound since last summer, but on a many-year timeframe has rather sucked as its energy stocks have lagged the broader market. Still, there are developed and emerging market ETFs from Schwab with the same methodology and high AUM, so it's a nice tool for a toolbox. Could still be a good recovery play this year.

&amp;#x200B;

More interesting and the motivation for the post is this little guy I just came across, the Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability &amp; Value ETF.

DSTL: [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl) , $247m AUM. Small but should be profitable so it's probably not going away anytime soon. Its methodology is in the prospectus, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus)

\----

Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability &amp; Value Index

Construction of the Index begins with the constituents of the Solactive US Large Cap Index, consisting of approximately 500 of the largest U.S.-listed companies, screened to remove companies that have less than five years of cash flow per share data available (the “Equity Universe”). The remaining companies are then evaluated based on the following three proprietary fundamental measures to identify the companies that will be included in the Index:

Financial Indebtedness

Companies with significant leverage (based on a proprietary debt-to-income calculation) are excluded from the Index.

Fundamental Stability

Each company is scored based on a proprietary measure of the volatility of its historical and projected cash flows as an indicator of fundamental stability. The bottom 50% (i.e., the least stable) of the companies in the Equity Universe based on this measure are excluded from the Index.

Valuation

Each company is scored based on a proprietary measure of the company’s free cash flow yield (a measure comparing a company’s normalized free cash flow to its enterprise value). The top 100 companies (the most undervalued) that meet the Index’s other criteria are included in the Index.

\----

Not a fan of ""proprietary"" measures in general, but, they discuss their ideas in various papers and the 2020 year-end letter: [https://distillatecapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Q4-2020-Letter.pdf](https://distillatecapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Q4-2020-Letter.pdf).

Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to [https://www.etfrc.com/funds/overlap.php](https://www.etfrc.com/funds/overlap.php). So it's not the S&amp;P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&amp;P 500 and ishares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way:

[https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/perf.php?VOO,DSTL,QUAL,VLUE&amp;n=561&amp;O=011000](https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/perf.php?VOO,DSTL,QUAL,VLUE&amp;n=561&amp;O=011000)

Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ.

Anyway, if you're looking for an ETF with large caps that don't have sky-high P/E ratios and don't want to be kept out of tech by ""value"" investing, DSTL seems like it's worth a look.

I use a very small brokerage account as an ""Emergency Fund/Explore the Market"" account. I started with just under $1,000 as per Dave Ramsey's initial emergency fund/baby step. I couldn't stand just letting the money sit in a shit savings account, so I invested it in some ""basics,"" like Apple, Disney, Microsoft, and Johnson &amp; Johnson. I've now also got some VTI, some Zoom, and some Plug, among a few others. My overall strategy is buy and hold, but I do want to make sure I'm not missing massive opportunities to sell. What I reinvest in when I sell is where I get lost. But it's so hard to not sell Plug right now. How do I make these decisions, especially if this is mostly for fun/preservation of capital? I'm surprisingly risk averse, though I'd be filthy rich had I poured more initial capital into this thing 5 years ago (we probably all say that at times).

Best example is PLUG, which I'm up 922% on. The equity is fairly low, but it now makes up 35% of my portfolio. Entire portfolio is up nearly 220% all time.

Q4 2020 Results expected on 03/10/2021

To be honest, I’m not sure how to read the financials of a clinical-stage pharma company.

You can look up the numbers by yourself and make your own decisions.

* **Stock Moving Events**:

1. 01/20 Closing of a recent offering at $2.6 a share.

Movement: Price dipped on 01/12 upon the news of offering. Quickly bought up on the same day; Price has increased 40% since 01/12.

1. 11/09/2020: announced Q3 2020 earnings and provided business update.

Movement: Price has been on a steady rise since 11/09. It rose to the $2.5 area in less than a month and it has been consolidating prior to Christmas. Price has been volatile from 12/22 until 01/12 the announcement of the offering.

&amp;#x200B;

MA10 and MA20 are extremely close for Jan, we can now see the MA10 departing MA20 and moving upward. Given the recent offering, I see $2.6 as a support and the market looks extremely bullish for this company.

* **Summary**:
* $CERC has some potential for a serious breakthrough with the company’s promising development in the 8 pipelines.
* CERC-002 is covid related and we can expect something major to happen in early 2021. It’s close to the end of the Phase 2 study and Phase 3 is on the horizon.
* Strong Institutional ownership with 29% of free float.
* Recent offering shows strong support at $2.6.
* As a clinical-stage pharma company, investing in the future also involves great risk. Do you own DD and make a conscious investment.

My positions:

400 shares at $2.9-$3.1

20+ $5 calls, with expiration from Mar to July.

I will average up along the way or buy dip if it occurs.

2021-01-23 16:19:56,r/stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning January 25th, 2021","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 25th, 2021.

# **Apple and Tesla earnings, along with the Fed and GDP will drive markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/22/apple-and-tesla-earnings-vaccine-news-and-the-fed-will-be-focus-of-markets-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Stimulus euphoria may be waning, but investors will have plenty to focus on in the week ahead, as a blast of earnings news hits, the Federal Reserve meets and new data will show the state of the economy at the end of the year.
*****
&gt; Stocks gained in the past week on optimism for a $1.9 trillion stimulus package, proposed by President Joe Biden. But by Friday, the market lost steam amid increased concerns about the pandemic’s economic impact, and as it seemed Biden would not have an easy time getting the stimulus plan approved.
*****
&gt; Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Tesla and more than 100 other S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings in the biggest rush of earnings reports this quarter.
*****
&gt; The pandemic will also be a factor as travel restrictions and lockdowns threaten the global economy, and worries remain over the speed of vaccine distributions.
*****
&gt; But there is hope that Johnson and Johnson will release positive news on its vaccine results soon, and if that’s the case it could signal another source of vaccines will be available. The J&amp;J vaccine would be a single shot, as opposed to the currently available double-shot vaccines.
*****
&gt; “We expect to see their results,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “That could be super bullish.” The company reports earnings on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Hogan said the market may also respond to Covid news. He said the seven-day average in new Covid cases fell below the 14-day average this past week for the first time since Thanksgiving, and if that continues, it could indicate a peak.
*****
&gt; If the virus news improves, the market could resume its grind higher in the coming week, said Hogan.
*****
&gt; # Economy
&gt; As for the economy, the first look at fourth quarter real gross domestic product comes Thursday, and it is expected to show growth of 4.7%, according to the CNBC/Moody’s Analytics Rapid Update survey. For the year, the economists surveyed expect GDP contracted by 3.5%. The economists forecast 5% growth for 2021.
*****
&gt; Consumers pulled back at the end of the fourth quarter, evidenced by a surprise 0.7% decline in December retail sales reported this past week, after a negative November.
*****
&gt; “You’re really going to see a loss of momentum throughout the quarter,” said Kevin Cummins, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets. “It’s a set up for a really weak Q1.” PMI data shows manufacturing activity has been strong, but labor market data is weak and consumer spending is disappointing.
*****
&gt; “You’ve got to juxtapose what’s happening with the vaccine and the virus with what’s happening with underlying data. We’ve definitely seen a lot of the things that could spark a pullback,” said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equity strategist at RBC.
*****
&gt; Calvasina and other strategists expect a sell-off early in the year.
*****
&gt; Stocks hit new highs across the major indices Wednesday, as Biden was inaugurated, and many technicians see the market as overbought. The catalyst for a pullback is not clear, but strategists expect the market to gain this year and say a buying opportunity would open up with any decline.
*****
&gt; “Do we start to see stuff showing up in that data that makes us question that recovery?” said Calvasina. “My assumption is we’re going to get a lot of volatility in that data, and we’re going to get some downdrafts but it’s not going to be bad enough to erase this upward trajectory we’ve seen in the economy since the second quarter.”
*****
&gt; # Fed ahead
The Fed is also a powerful backstop for the market, and economists don’t expect the Fed to take any action or change in its dovish tone when it releases its statement Wednesday afternoon, following its two-day meeting.
*****
&gt; “I don’t see them making many changes,” said Cummins of NatWest. “They’ll probably acknowledge just the fact that employment was weak.
*****
&gt; “It’s going to be pretty clear cut,” he added. “I think Powell will sound similar to what he sounded like in September.” Cummins said the Fed chairman is likely to say the economic outlook depends on the course of the virus and vaccine.
*****
&gt; There is also durable goods data Wednesday and personal income and spending data on Friday. The Fed’s favorite inflation gauge, the PCE deflator is also released Friday, and Powell will surely be asked Wednesday afternoon about inflation, which is increasingly being priced into market expectations.
*****
&gt; Powell is also likely to be asked his views on fiscal stimulus, which could end up being smaller than some expect.
*****
&gt; Hogan of National Securities said the market traded lower on Friday on expectations the package could be smaller and take longer than expected to gain approval.
*****
&gt; “I think the realism of saying $1.9 trillion and doing $1.9 trillion are two different things,” he said. “We fall into that trap all the time.”
*****
&gt; “What’s happening now is there is no magic wand here,” Hogan added. “It’s not to say there’s no stimulus. It’s just a matter of how long it will take and how much there will be. There’s a little bit of realism.”
*****
&gt; Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, said a pullback could be sparked if bitcoin starts to fall more sharply, since some investors would sell stock in response. “When there’s no bid in bitcoin they have to sell something, and they sell stock,” said Maley.
*****
&gt; Bitcoin has had a wild early ride in 2021. The cryptocurrency hit a record high of $41,973 on Jan. 12, according to data from Coin Metrics. Days later, it fell about 15%, wiping out as much as $200 billion in just 24 hours.
*****
&gt; Bitcoin then regained some of its losses, surging to near $40,000 before another reversal. On Friday, it was trading at $33,200 after dipping below $30,000.
*****
&gt; “If this thing starts tanking again, it’s going to cause some forced selling and it’s going to cause some selling in the stock market,” said Maley, adding it will be important to hold the low from Thursday night.
*****
&gt; He said the short position in the dollar is also an overcrowded trade that could turn quickly. A resulting short squeeze could cause a dollar rally that would be negative for the stock market. He also is watching Tesla, which reports earnings on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; “I think whether it be bitcoin, the dollar, Tesla, one of these crowded trades...it’s going to turn the narrative that’s permeating right now, and if we don’t get a surprise the market will continue to push higher,” he said.

&gt; # February Almanac: Worst S&amp;P 500 Month of Post-Election Years

&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.0% in February since 1979—just the sixth best month for that benchmark.

&gt; February’s post-election year performance since 1950 is miserable, ranking dead last for S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000. Average losses have been sizable: -1.5%, -3.3% and -1.6% respectively. February ranks tenth for DJIA in post-election years with an average loss of 1.1%. February 2001 and 2009 were exceptionally brutal. NASDAQ dropped 22.4% in February 2001, its third worst monthly loss ever.

&gt; # Housing Closes Out 2020 on a Positive Note

&gt; Housing closed out 2020 on an extremely positive note as both Housing Starts and Building Permits topped forecasts by more than 100K. Since 2002, there have only been ten other months where both reports topped forecasts by more than 100K, and today's report was the third time it happened in the last 12 months!

&gt; The table below breaks down the details of the December report in terms of both single and multi-family units and regions. One of the clear areas of strength was in single-family starts and permits. On a y/y basis, both were up over 25%, and relative to November, starts were up 12% while permits rose 7.8%. Multi-family units, meanwhile, both saw declines with notable weakness in multi-family starts. On a regional basis, most areas of the country saw strength although starts and permits were down m/m and y/y in the Northeast.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-Details.png))**

&gt; Given its overall size, you can easily make the case that as goes the housing market, so goes the economy, and history tends to bear this out. The top chart shows the 12-month average of Housing Starts going back to 1967 with recessions overlaid in gray. With the exception of the latest downturn, every prior recession was preceded by a rollover in Housing Starts. Given the sudden onset of the pandemic, housing played no role in the current recession, but once the lockdowns started, the residential housing market wasn't immune to the weakness. Whatever weakness there was didn't last long. As shown in the second chart below, less than a year after the recession started, both the 12-month average of Housing Starts and Building Permits have now moved back above their pre-pandemic highs.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-and-Business-Cycle.png))**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-and-Business-Cycle-Last-10-Years.png))**

&gt; While Housing Starts and Building Permits are both at new multi-year highs, on a population-adjusted basis, they're still closer to levels typically associated with recessions than expansions. After adjusting for population growth, Housing Starts would need to come in above 1.9 million just to keep up with population growth.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-Population-Adjusted.png))**

&gt; As for the stocks of homebuilders, the performance of the iShares Home Construction ETF (ITB) tends to track trends in Housing Starts and Building Permits pretty closely, so it's no surprise that it also traded to a new all-time high on Thursday for the first time in three months. As long as interest rates don't see a sudden spike higher, trends in place for the residential housing market remain positive.

&gt; # Impressive Reading From The Philly Fed

&gt; Of the several strong economic data points to have been released today, perhaps the strongest relative to expectations was the Philadelphia Fed's monthly survey on the region's manufacturing sector. The headline index was expected to rise from 11.1 to 11.8. Instead, it more than doubled expectations rising to 26.5. That is the highest reading since last February just before the pandemic's full impact was felt. Overall, the report showed the region's manufacturing sector experienced strong growth in January with accelerating growth in demand, prices, and employment.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-HL.png))**

&gt; In the table below, we break down the various sub-indices of the report. Nearly every component experienced a month over month increase that ranks in the top few percentiles of their respective histories. That also left most indices in the top decile of their historic ranges. That compares to last month in which most readings were far more moderate. Although most indices for current conditions saw impressive readings, the indices for expectations were much more mixed with a larger number falling than rising MoM. Given every one of these indices remains positive, though, the region's manufacturers still have an overall optimistic outlook.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Table1.png))**

&gt; Of all the sub-indices, the New Orders index saw one of the most significant increases in January rising 28.1 percentage points from a barely expansionary reading of 1.9 to a much stronger reading of 30. Going back over the past couple of years, the only times this index was higher was in October (32.9) and February (30.7) of last year. That indicates very strong new order growth after a slowdown in December.

&gt; Similarly, the index for unfilled orders was the only index in contractionary territory (those below zero) last month, but there was a massive improvement this month as the index surged to a reading of 25.6. Both the level of the index and the monthly change stand in the top 1% of all readings going back through the history of the survey which began in 1968. The only times the index has been higher was in August of 1972 (26) and January (29.6) and March (45.1) of 1973. In other words, New Orders remain strong while Unfilled Orders are bouncing back at a historic rate.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Orders.png))**

&gt; While the unfilled orders index reached one of the highest readings on record, the index for Delivery Times actually hit a new record. The index rose 12.7 points to a record high of 30; surpassing the previous record of 21.3 from October of 2017. Higher readings in this index indicate that supplier lead times are longer and vice versa for lower readings. That means a historic number of respondents are seeing delays in their supply chains.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Deliveries.png)**

&gt; Perhaps to get ahead of the growing demand and longer lead times, businesses are also reporting higher inventories. That index rose to the highest level since September of 2019 which also stands in the top 5% of all readings in the history of the data.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Inv.png)**

&gt; Given the stronger demand and tighter supply lines, prices have also been accelerating. Both Prices Paid and Prices Received experienced some of their largest monthly increases on record after rising 20.5 points in January. At 45.4, the index for Prices Paid is at its highest level since August of 2018. Those price increases are also getting passed along to customers as the index for Prices Received is at the highest level since February of 1989. These results echo some other hints of more inflationary conditions like the New York Fed's readings last week and the ISM services and manufacturing report earlier this month.

&gt; # Real-time COVID-19 Data Suggests Final Peak May Be Here

&gt; It has been exactly one year since the first COVID-19 case in the United States was reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and to say the world as we know it has been completely changed would be an understatement. Thankfully, we may finally be seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.

&gt; With the rollout of multiple approved vaccines underway, some real-time COVID-19 indicators and mobility-related data points have put in their final highs (or lows). As shown in the LPL chart of the day, restrictions implemented at the end of 2020 appear to be helping to curb the spread of the virus, as new COVID-19 cases and those currently hospitalized have been on the decline.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Meanwhile, the positive rate has also declined despite daily tests near all-time highs.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; However, while COVID-19 data has been improving, real-time economic indicators like OpenTable reservations show businesses continue to struggle as restrictions on activities to curb the late-2020 surge remain in place.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Similarly, the number of people getting on airlines has fallen back to mid-October levels after the holiday bump. Domestic air travel activity remains 64% below pre-pandemic levels.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “The good news is that cases are declining and vaccine distribution is increasing, but service industries and air travel are clearly still under a lot of pressure,” said LPL Research Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While manufacturing and housing data remain firm, recent data on the job market and consumer spending have been choppy.”

&gt; It’s very encouraging to see COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations improving, a trend we hope will continue until this pandemic ends for good. In the meantime, we will continue to follow high-frequency data to gauge the recovery’s progress. The next report card comes next week with the release of fourth quarter 2020 gross domestic product (GDP).

&gt; We’ll also be closely watching developments in Washington, DC. The economy’s bridge to the other side will likely get stronger in the coming weeks with more stimulus—potentially to the tune of another $700 billion to $1 trillion.

I also use the RSI, Stochastic, Vortex, and 10-50-200EMA lines. but most importantly, price action is key.\*\*

**MY FAVORITE: ACCO, ADC, CARR, CP, HRTX, KREF, SDC**

&amp;#x200B;

$ACCO - This is a 50EMA bounce, at channel support, at support, and in ascending triangle. This is a great setup. Vortex and Stoch is low, showing divergence. Fantastic setup.

  [https://tos.mx/Z3adAWW](https://tos.mx/Z3adAWW)

&amp;#x200B;

$ADC  - Great channel, but there are lower highs throughout. We just need to see if it reverses here or $63. Indicators show it can drop a little bit more.

  [https://tos.mx/alKNuAZ](https://tos.mx/alKNuAZ)

&amp;#x200B;

$CARR - Beautiful channel up, bouncing religiously off the 200EMA Line. Can drop a bit more, but a perfect setup. Indicators are very low which is good.

  [https://tos.mx/RA2bVYi](https://tos.mx/RA2bVYi)

&amp;#x200B;

$CP   - Different channels up, both show history of reversing here. At support, but may not reverse until $340. all indicators low, which is a good sign.

  [https://tos.mx/IFiBXta](https://tos.mx/IFiBXta)

&amp;#x200B;

$CRWD - Triangle forming into a possible breakout here. Bouncing off 50EMA, super clear play up here -- just overbought overall. Indicators are low again.

  [https://tos.mx/YXZFnlZ](https://tos.mx/YXZFnlZ)

&amp;#x200B;

$EAF  - 50EMA bounce again, at support and near channel up play. Vortex is low and RSI low, but Stoch isn't so a good -- not great setup. 

  [https://tos.mx/IEyVPOB](https://tos.mx/IEyVPOB)

&amp;#x200B;

$GSKY - We just called it, and still at value. All indicators still low, we just need volume to push it up!

  [https://tos.mx/iEAA7NP](https://tos.mx/iEAA7NP)

&amp;#x200B;

$HRTX - Great channel up, making a good ascending triangle. At support and channel support, All indicators low but showing life which is good.

  [https://tos.mx/ND6Tju8](https://tos.mx/ND6Tju8)

&amp;#x200B;

$JNJ  - Obvious channel up, but this will not last forever. Can we squeeze a few more %? Let's see. 50EMA bounce as well, indicators are fair at best.

  [https://tos.mx/nmSjrBA](https://tos.mx/nmSjrBA)

&amp;#x200B;

$KPTI - Still in this great pattern, just consolidating right now. Indicators still low, but we just need to see some volume to get us above the EMA lines.

  [https://tos.mx/FSigKcS](https://tos.mx/FSigKcS)

&amp;#x200B;

$KREF - Channel up again, perfect ascending triangle as well. At 200EMA and support as well. Indicators are fair, but I think we may see a big move soon.

  [https://tos.mx/B5p7oQY](https://tos.mx/B5p7oQY)

&amp;#x200B;

$NGD  - Great channel up, and really showing some life here. Support, channel, and everything we love. Indicators are just fair though.

  [https://tos.mx/RAGPcGX](https://tos.mx/RAGPcGX)

&amp;#x200B;

$SDC  -Beautiful channel up and ascending triangle. All indicators look great as well, so this is a great setup. We just need to see some life and green.

  [https://tos.mx/7jQfhKM](https://tos.mx/7jQfhKM)

&amp;#x200B;

$TTMI - Obvious plays off of the 50EMA here. Obvious channel up as well, but how long will it last? Vortex super low, but RSI just fair.

2021-01-21 20:08:48,r/stocks,Dividend Stocks/ETFs,"Hey guys,

I'm pretty new to all of this. I was curious on current opinions on dividend stocks/ETFs? I think that right now with the current market we are in growth stocks will beat dividend stocks, but was thinking of adding some dividend stock as a diversification and a different kind of compounding growth for 20 years from now.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking at things like JNJ or WBA for individual or VIG or SCHD for ETFs

2021-01-15 18:56:42,r/stocks,Building a Dividend Portfolio,"Good Afternoon all,

Long time lurker here, and I started to delve into the stock market early last year. I have done a considerable amount of research and decided that a long term dividend reinvestment portfolio would be my style. I'm not a massive risk taker, and playing the highs and lows of the market is not something I want to do right now nor have the time to do. Maybe in the future. As I said, I spent a lot of time researching and building a portfolio that I think is well diversified (haven't bought into every position yet, but we're getting there). I included some of the typical mainstays like HD, JNJ, KO, MMM, T etc. 

My question - or rather just looking for thoughts / ideas / experiences is building this portfolio through some of the more risky(?) stocks, like GAIN, ARCC and T. Since these stocks are cheaper and pay out more (as %) I can help build the account value a little quicker to get some of the dividend aristocrat stocks such as MMM, KO, JNJ, MCD etc. Just curious as to the thoughts on this, and yes I'm well aware you're all internet strangers, I shouldn't listen yada yada. I'm well aware, but using this platform to get ideas / thoughts / reasons is just another tool in helping anyone become a more well rounded investor, which is why I am here asking. 

Bonus part 2, if anyone feels like answering: I have included no ETF's into my portfolio at this time. I have not delved deeply into researching them but I get that they can offer quick diversification at a slight expense. I may add something like an SPYD (or another ETF that allows me cheap access to APPL, MSFT etc.) to the portfolio in the future just for the further diversification. Are these worth getting into for a long term dividend paying portfolio?

Thanks all!!",8,1,nevosoinverno,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kxzvex/building_a_dividend_portfolio/,kxzvex

After posting here I took into consideration of some feedback and made some changes

I started investing a few months ago starting off with VOO BND CVS JNJ now my current portfolio has 80% VOO 20% QQQ and another 20% BND.

I plan on adding VXUS so I can gain international exposure and removing BND because I’m 27.

I have QQQ for additional exposure to technology

Does this look good? Should I change the percentage?

2020-12-01 18:50:19,r/stocks,Are there any people here that actually invest in a stock/stocks for 10-20 years or even more. Is everyone chasing the hype and meme stocks?,"I feel like that the amount of people who try to time the market with their buys and sells is pretty big in this sub. Don’t see that many people with the ”boomer” view on this. I think it’s kinda weird considering that you’ll have a much better chance of succeding if you pick market leaders with good and stable growth, revenue, low debt etc. This made it sound really easy, but you get what I mean.

Like, I get it why the companies like PLTR, NIO and SE get a lot more attention, since the biggest and the quickest growth and winnings come from the companies that are new and have a lot of potential, but it still bugs me out that people are doing ”investing” more and more from a trading stand point rather than the traditional buy and hold strategy. People are lacking patience.

People can do whatever they want, but if we forward to 10 years in time, how many of us can actually provide solid returns with the constant buying and selling that can perform better than the S&amp;P 500, so about 10% annually. It’s gonna be real hard with timing the market consistantly. Even picking the right growth stock can be really hard eben though Reddit and the amount of speculation does help a bit with it. There isn’t any guarentees that PLTR can be a blue chip company in 20 years. Sure, there isn’t anything sure about AAPL or MSFT either, but at least they’ve proven they can do it on a solid basis.

Don’t want to be mean or anything, just wondering if it’s really worth trying to time the market if you can get steadier profits from the already existing market leaders. I do enjoy reading newsand staying informed, but IMO it’d be safer just to stick with the blue chips. The point of investing is gaining wealth steadily, not gambling with it, right? The biggest bonus with growth stocks is probably the possibility of getting huge profits in a short term which isn’t a reality with the blue chips. You can still get tons of profits with MSFT, JNJ or AAPL, it’s just that it won’t happen overnight. I think you should have a healthy mix of both market leaders and growth stocks.

I don’t know what I’m trying to say with this. Maybe I just wanted to point this out that you shouldn’t ”gamble” everything when investing amid all this speculation and info you get about any stock here.

2020-11-24 23:15:05,r/stocks,Market and Options Summary for Nov-24-2020,"## Daily Synopsis 
* The S&amp;P 500 increased +1.61% today while the NASDaq added (+1.43%). The Russell 2000 rose by (+1.88%). The Dow ended in positive territory at (+1.53%)
* The best performing sector was Energy(+5.14%) while Real Estate(-0.05%)was the worst performer.
* Specifically, the General Services Administration said it will release funds to help the Biden administration transition into office, Wells Fargo (WFC 28.60, +2.30, +8.8%) was double upgraded to Outperform from Underperform at Raymond James, and numerous retailers reported better-than-expected earnings reports. 
* Dollar Tree (DLTR 111.35, +13.74, +14.1%) shares rose 14% following its earnings results, but truthfully, most of the earnings reactions weren't that great since the news may have already been priced in. Shares of Best Buy (BBY 113.54, -8.50, -7.0%) fell 7% despite beating top and bottom-line estimates. 
* There were also semblances of greed and froth in the market. For example, shares of Tesla (TSLA 555.38, +33.53, +6.4%) surged 6% on no specific news to bring the company's market capitalization to over $500 billion. Hedging interest remained relatively suppressed with the CBOE Volatility Index (-1.02, -4.5%) closing at 21.64. 
* Looking ahead, investors will receive a massive amount of data on Wednesday, most notably the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, New Home Sales for October, Personal Income and Spending for October, and the FOMC Minutes from the November meeting.

Now I’m up $210 vs SPY at 360 $8 over spy in the past 3 months.

I figured I would change my strategy after a risky gamble from a certain other sub. So I did, I diversified my portfolio among 15 stocks putting in about $5 a week in the ones going red on the day of deposit. 

I have fractional shares in each of my stocks but I’m hoping I can get to atleast 1 share each before playing with money again just so I have consistent earnings. Anyways here are the stocks...

SPY

PEP

MSFT

JNJ

SCHD

SDY

IWF

VOOG

AGG

IJR

IJH

AMZN

OXLC

TSLA

DIS

I have the bonds for the sake of red days and as a result, almost every red day for SPY I will destroy it losing mere cents whereas SPY loses dollars. 

I currently reinvest dividends just cause 2 cents ain’t helping my bank account lmao. 

And my biggest share at the moment is SDY, it appears to be growing faster than SPY and is meant as a dividend ETF which makes me happy.

If y’all have any criticisms for my plan or advice on better improving it I’m all ears, I’m just glad after about 2 months playing with stocks I started this plan and now have this foundation to be proud of.",0,0,Herokam,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jvw6ey/i_beat_spy_for_the_past_3_months_heres_how/,jvw6ey

2020-10-29 21:41:25,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, October 29, 2020. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 29, 2020**

Stocks rose today, reversing course after being deep in the red the last two days. Market participants digested a record increase in third-quarter GDP for the US, a better-than-expected weekly unemployment report, new coronavirus restrictions in the US and Europe and a slew of corporate earnings for massive companies.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 1.75% today, the best performing of the major indices. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 1.05% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.44%.

After coming off one of the worst quarters in US history, the economy rebounded, growing at its fastest pace ever. Gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of the total goods and services produced from July to September of this year, expanded at a 33.1% annualized pace, according to the report by the Department of Commerce. The gain came after a 31.4% plunge in the second quarter and was better than the 32% estimate from economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The previous record was the post-World War II 16.7% surge in the first quarter of 1950.

Today, the US Department of Commerce released its weekly unemployment report, showing that another 751,000 individuals filed initial jobless claims, better than the 770,000 estimated by analysts.  Continuing claims, which refer to individuals that are currently receiving unemployment benefits who filed for unemployment benefits at least two weeks ago, was 7.75 million, slightly better than the 7.77 million expected. According to Yahoo Finance, this report represents the ninth-straight week initial unemployment claims have remained below 1 million and continuing claims below 10 million, a key indicator that the economy is recovering, though not as fast as many would like.

In Europe, countries are still struggling to contain the recent surge in coronavirus infections. Both France and Germany announced renewed lockdowns spanning for about the next month, though the restrictions stopped short of the draconian measures announced earlier on during the pandemic. In the US, the seven-day average of daily new cases rose to a record 70,000 as of yesterday, according to data compiled by the Washington Post.

On the vaccine front, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, said he believed it would take until at least January for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to authorize a COVID-19 vaccine. There are five companies (Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Moderna (MRNA), Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (ELY), and BioNTech (BNTX)) in the final stages of study for a coronavirus vaccine, with Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. having fully enrolled their trials, Fauci said.

Some analysts consider the recent pull-back in the stock market a healthy inevitability, given the strong rally that took many stocks to all-time highs earlier in the Month. Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, said in a note to clients, “Markets have been baking in a lot of optimism: that the pandemic was under control, that the economy was healing, and that things would be back to something approaching normal in 2021. Those assumptions were always optimistic, though, and what we are seeing now is a reality-based repricing. As such, this drop is both necessary and healthy. Markets should reflect the most likely future path, not the most optimistic, and that is where we are headed.”

I do like the FSKAX index fund because I can invest the amount I want but I also love QQQ... The price of each doesn’t really matter to me but I’m just looking for opinions on which one to focus on at age 27.

Stocks accelerated yesterday’s losses as market participants digested a new round of corporate earnings report and the prospects of additional stimulus before the November presidential election.

The Nasdaq finished 0.84% down. The S&amp;P (SPY) fell 0.63%, and the Dow Jones finished the day 0.53% down.

Today, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin admitted that coming to a deal regarding stimulus and advancing the measure through Congress would be “difficult” before the November election. The remarks come shortly after Mnuchin and House Speaker Pelosi met on the phone to negotiate further, a deal Pelosi’s spokesperson called “productive”. The two are set to discuss again tomorrow, but after multiple weeks of discussion and the November election coming ever-nearer, chances for additional stimulus look dim. 

The impasse between US lawmakers over stimulus is alarming, given the frequent calls of Pres. Trump, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members, and economist for more virus-relief. Yesterday, Senate Leader Mitch McConnel said he would introduce a smaller, more targeted proposal to the Senate when the chamber reconvenes next Monday. He said “When the full Senate returns on October 19th, our first order of business will be voting again on targeted relief for American workers, including new funding for the PPP.” The estimated $500 billion deal is way below the $1.8 trillion package proposed by the White House earlier in the week, a sign that negotiations may be souring. However, Pelosi has made it clear she would not support smaller, targeted bills, calling them inadequate. Pres. Trump appears to agree with her, tweeting “Go big or go home!!!” for more stimulus. 

In other news, two companies in the forefront of vaccine development for the coronavirus announced their respective trials were put on trial over safety concerns. Eli Lilly (LLY) said Tuesday afternoon that enrollment for its COVID-19 treatment would be temporarily halted, less than a day after Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) said clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate were paused due to an unexplained illness in a participant. Shares of Eli Lilly and Johnson &amp; Johnson were little changed overnight after dropping during Tuesday’s session.

In terms of earnings season, all eyes are on big banks as they have already started to report. An article published by Marketbeat summarized sentiment by stating that “JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Bank of America saw their profits partly recover in the third quarter from the depths of the coronavirus-caused recession earlier this year. The turnaround stems mostly from improvements in the U.S. economy that allowed these big banks to set aside less money to cover potentially bad loans — $5 billion in the third quarter versus $33 billion in the second quarter.”

**Highlights**

Stocks traded mostly lower today, losing some of yesterday’s gains. Market participants are digesting the first batch of corporate earnings, special events from giants Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL), and as usual, developments in Washington regarding fiscal stimulus.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished even on the day. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) 0.64% down and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.58%.

Economists and financial analysts expect companies within the S&amp;P 500 to post an aggregate earnings per share decline of 19.4% over this year. This estimate is higher than the 20.5% decline predicted back in the Spring. LPL Research said in a note, “The increase in analysts’ earnings estimates reflects increased confidence in the outlook, even with the challenges Covid-19 still presents in terms of social distancing, various safety protocols, and shifting consumer behavior. We have been encouraged by recent data pointing to a continued steady reopening of the economy, and we believe the likelihood that additional lockdowns may meaningfully impair business activity remains very low.

Today, in a letter, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the White House’s new proposal for coronavirus aid, saying that “in terms of addressing testing, tracing and treatment, what the Trump Administration has offered is wholly insufficient.” After a day of promising developments yesterday, it appears stimulus negotiations have stalled once again. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel said his party was preparing a new, targeted package of “roughly $500 billion”. However, Pelosi has stated in the past, in response to the airline relief bill, that she will not support targeted stimulus, only a comprehensive package. Over the weekend, the Trump administration called on Congress to pass a smaller $1.8 billion coronavirus relief bill as negotiations on a bigger package continue to run into roadblocks.

**Highlights** 

* Today Apple announced a slate of new products, including the next generation of iPhones (the iPhone 12) that supports the burgeoning 5G network. It also announced a new smart home speaker and a new way to charge devices, called MagSafe, which lets charger, cases, and other accessories snap onto the back of the device using a magnet. The stock was down today, after rallying around 6% yesterday. 
* Today is Amazon Prime Day ""one-day only event filled with more deals than Black Friday, exclusively for Prime members around the globe."" The world’s largest online retailer is slashing the prices on a lot of popular items.
* Eli Lilly’s (LLY) late-stage trial of its leading monoclonal antibody treatment for the coronavirus has been paused by U.S. health regulators over potential safety concerns, the company confirmed. The stock was more than 3.3% down at the time of writing. 
* Delta Airlines (DAL) reported worse than expected earnings in EPS and revenue. Stock was more than 2% down.
   * EPS of -$3.30 vs -$3.10 estimate
   * Revenue of $3.06 billion v $3.12 billion. 
* Big banks showed remarkable strength in earnings, despite the effects of the pandemic.
   * Citigroup (C) reported EPS of $1.40 vs $0.77 estimate and Revenue of $17.3 billion vs $17.18 billion estimate. Stock was more than 4% down at the time of writing
   * JP Morgan (JPM) reported EPS of $2.92 vs $1.86 estimate and Revenue of $29.90 billion vs $28.20 billion. Stock was around 1.5% down at the time of writing. 
* Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) better than expected earnings. The stock was 2.3% down at the time of writing.
   * EPS $2.20 vs $1.98 estimate
   * Revenue of $21.08 billion vs $20.15 billion estimate.
   * The company late-stage coronavirus vaccine was paused after a participant reported an “adverse event” about 36 hours earlier, the company’s chief financial officer said today
* Boeing (BA) said Tuesday that it didn't win any new orders in September and delivered only 11 aircrafts this month, due to decreased demand in light of the pandemic.
* Workhorse (WKHS) shares are around 12.8% after a USPS contract decision was reportedly delayed, prompting a stock downgrade from Roth Capital.
* BMO Capital markets upgrades in the hotel space:
   * Hilton Hotels (HLT) $72 to $89 from UNDERPERFORM to MARKET PERFORM

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 12th, 2020.

# **Earnings could be a positive force for stocks as Washington continues to wrangle over stimulus  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/earnings-could-be-a-positive-force-for-stocks-as-washington-continues-to-wrangle-over-stimulus.html)**
*****
&gt; Stock market optimism for a stimulus package has been rising, but the focus swings to earnings and that could be a positive for stocks in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley all release earnings in the first big wave of corporate reports. There is also some important data, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for September on Friday.
*****
&gt; “It looks like earnings season might turn out better than expected, based on early reports,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. “The guidance looks pretty good. So, we have earnings season upon us, the stimulus talks go back and forth, and it looks like maybe there’s a will to get something done.”
*****
&gt; On Friday afternoon, the White House raised its offer for at stimulus package to $1.8 trillion but was still below the $2.2 trillion sought by Democrats. “It’s really hard to read,” said Keon.
*****
&gt; But he said even if there’s no agreement on stimulus now, there should be a package after the election, regardless of who wins. 
*****
&gt; “I actually put some money to work in small caps on the belief if we get further stimulus either soon or a few months from now, you do want to own economically sensitive stocks,” said Keon.“We’re reasonably constructive on the market and valuations are not cheap, but compared to the 10-year [Treasury yield] at less than 80 basis points, stocks don’t look that bad.”
*****
&gt; Stocks in the past week had their best performance since early July, with the S&amp;P 500 up 3.8% at 3,477. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 6.4%. The 10-year Treasury yield had a big move during the week from about 0.70% to as high as 0.79% Friday. Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year yield has now broken out of a range its been stuck in below 0.70%.
*****
&gt; Earnings could provide positive momentum for stocks, if companies continue to beat estimates at a healthy pace, like last quarter.
*****
&gt; “Q2 reporting season saw S&amp;P 500 earnings beat at an unprecedented rate, both in terms of breadth (85%) and size (+20%), prompting historically rare, strong upgrades to forward estimates, especially for the cyclicals, and one of the strongest earnings season rallies on record,” wrote Deutsche Bank strategists.
*****
&gt; The summer earnings rally came before the big September decline, which took the S&amp;P 500  down about 10%. The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 8% since Sept. 24.
*****
&gt; “While the bottom-up consensus for Q3 is for a sharp rebound in headline earnings, the bulk of it is being driven by reductions in loan loss provisions and Energy sector losses. Excluding these, underlying earnings growth is forecast to barely move up (-15% to -13%), despite rising Q3 GDP growth estimates pointing to a strong macro rebound,” they noted.
*****
&gt; The Deutsche strategists said the question remains, however, whether the market will respond to earnings beats or election uncertainty.
*****
&gt; Keon said the market has been moving up as former vice president Joe Biden extended his lead in the polls because there’s less chance of an uncertain outlook the more one candidate leads. According to RealClearPolitics, he was leading President Donald Trump by 9.7 percentage points, from just about  6 points at the beginning of the prior week.
*****
&gt; “I think from the market’s perspective, it doesn’t really matter who wins, as long as we have a clear winner,” said Keon. “I think the direction of the polls are suggesting that we’re going to have a clear winner either on election night or a few days after that. The risk of a messy contested election is going down, and the market is relieved by that.”
*****
&gt; Tom Block, Washington analyst at Fundstrat, said Trump appears to be hoping for a stimulus bill signing before the election to help his re-election effort.
*****
&gt; “There are many moving parts here, and they’re all moving in different directions,” said Block. “It’s not impossible a deal comes together but the pathway to a deal is not clear on Friday afternoon because of the mixed signals that have come out over the last seven days from the White House.”
*****
&gt; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has opposed a large package, and the two sides have been stalemated. “I think the president believes that he will be helped by having a signed ceremony at the White House approving the bill, that the optics of signing the bill that’s going to send relief to people is an optic he desperately wants, and it can’t hurt,” he said.
*****
&gt; The economic recovery is going on in the background, and some parts of the economy have shown real improvement, like housing.
*****
&gt; Retail sales on Friday is a good look at how the consumer has been faring, now that enhanced unemployment benefits have been gone for the past two months. Economists expect 0.6% gain in retail sales, the same as August.
*****
&gt; Keon said it is important to get some more help for the economy through stimulus. There is expected to be one-time payments to individuals and enhanced employment benefits.
*****
&gt; “That would be good news for the market, if we could get more help where it is needed. We really just need to get a bridge for a more normal circumstances next year,” said Keon.

&gt; # Ten-Baggers Under Trump

&gt; In our prior post we looked at the best and worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks since Election Day 2016. In this post we've broadened our filter and looked at the Russell 3,000, which is an index that covers more than 98% of all publicly traded market cap in the US. Within the Russell 3,000, there are 32 stocks that are up more than 1,000% since Trump was elected. These 32 ""ten-baggers"" -- as Peter Lynch liked to call them -- are listed in the table below.

&gt; At the top of the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH), which is up 8,892% since Election Day 2016. While Enphase has ""Energy"" in its company name, it's actually a Technology sector stock that ""manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control."" Next up is Zynex (ZYXI) with a gain of 7,211%, followed by Digital Turbine (APPS) up 5,320%. ZYXI markets itself as a ""better and safer way to manage pain"" than opiods using electrotherapy devices. APPS is an app marketing company that helps app developers get their product on as many devices as possible.

&gt; Of the 16 best performing Russell 3,000 stocks since Election Day 2016, 15 come from either the Technology or Health Care sectors. XPEL is the only stock in the top ten that's not in either the Tech or Health Care sectors. Up 2,341% since Trump was elected, XPEL is a Consumer Discretionary stock whose main product is to provide auto-paint protection.

&gt; Along with the names mentioned already, other notables on the list of ten-baggers under Trump include Jack Dorsey's Square (SQ), pet-food maker Freshpet (FRPT), digital health company Teladoc (TDOC), the arts and crafts social media company Etsy (ETSY), and of course, Tesla (TSLA). With a gain of 1,002% since November 8th, 2016, Tesla just barely makes the cut!

&gt; # Best Performing Stocks Since Election Day 2016

&gt; On Monday we published our asset class performance matrix showing total returns for key ETFs since Election Day 2016 (11/8/16). Today we wanted to highlight the individual stocks traded on US exchanges that have performed the best and the worst since President Trump surprised the world with a victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. First off, below is a chart showing the average performance of stocks in each S&amp;P 500 sector since Election Day 2016. (These are based on stocks currently in the index and not as the index stood on 11/8/16.)

&gt; As shown, the average stock in the broad S&amp;P 500 is up 67.3% since Trump was elected. Four sectors have posted stronger average returns than that -- Technology (+160.4%), Health Care (+100.3%), Consumer Discretionary (+74.6%), and Industrials (+69.9%).

&gt; The Energy sector stands out like a sore thumb in the chart below. While every other sector has at least averaged double-digit percentage gains, the stocks in the Energy sector are down an average of 52.3% since Trump was elected! Other sectors that have been weaker than the broad market include Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Financials.

&gt; If you were to ask most people back in November 2016 which areas of the market should outperform under Trump and which should underperform, you'd likely see results that are the exact opposite of what has actually happened. Sectors like Energy, Real Estate, and Financials would have been expected to benefit from Trump since those are the industries he's most associated with, while Tech is a sector that's usually expected to benefit more when the Democratic party is in control.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/avgsector.png))**

&gt; Looking at individual stocks, below we show the 46 stocks currently in the S&amp;P 500 that are up at least 200% since Election Day 2016. Two stocks -- Etsy (ETSY) and Advanced Micro (AMD) -- have been ""10-baggers"" with gains of more than 1,000%, while another three -- Paycom (PAYC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and DexCom (DXCM) -- are up more than 500%. Other names on the list are a who's who of the most popular stocks over the past few years, including Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), salesforce.com (CRM), and PayPal (PYPL).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/bestsince16.png))**

&gt; While there are 46 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 up more than 200% since Election Day 2016, there are 32 stocks that are down more than 50% over the same time frame. The Energy sector is the most represented on this list by far with 14 stocks overall and 10 of the worst 11! The only non-Energy stock in the top ten is General Electric (GE), which is down 76% since Trump was elected. Other notable losers include airlines and cruiselines like AAL, CCL, and NCLH, and consumer stocks like TAP, KHC, UAA, WBA, and LB.

&gt; General Electric (GE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are the two names that stand out the most. Each of these stocks were at one point in time the largest company in the world, but they're both now shells of their former selves with huge losses over the last four years. Remember these two examples when you're looking at the largest companies in the world right now. Chances are a few of them will experience similar fates as GE and XOM over the next ten to twenty years.

&gt; # News High for Net New Highs

&gt; Yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 closed at its highest level since only a few days after the early September high. While the index has yet to reach a new high, many individual stocks in the index have. As shown in the charts below, 11.71% of S&amp;P 500 stocks closed at a new 52-week high yesterday while no stocks closed at a new 52-week low. That makes for the second-highest net new highs reading of the pandemic with the only higher reading (17.62%) occurring just over a month ago at the last all-time high on September 2nd. Before that, the last time net new highs were as high as now was on February 19th: the last all-time high before the bear market began.

&gt; As for the individual sectors, there has also been a significant pickup in the net percentage of new 52-week highs. Industrials currently has the highest reading of net new highs among the 11 sectors at 26%. Just like the broader S&amp;P 500, that is the highest since September 2nd when the net percentage of new highs rose above 30%. Consumer Discretionary is the runner up in being the sector with the highest percentage of net new highs. One distinguishing factor, though, is whereas every other sector has seen higher readings at some point since the bear market in the spring, Consumer Discretionary's current reading of 18% is tied with the reading from August 24th. On the other end of the spectrum, both Communication Services and the Energy sector have seen no new highs over the past few days. Granted, there have not been any new 52-week lows either. Meanwhile, Financials and Real Estate have both seen an uptick in net new highs, but it has been much more modest than other sectors.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100920-Net-New-Highs.png))**

*****

&gt; # Breadth Booming

&gt; One of the most notable aspects of the rally off the late September lows has been broad participation. As shown below, breadth is very strong as the 10-day advance-decline lines for several sectors are at some of their highest levels of the past year. For the S&amp;P 500, the 10-day advance-decline line is at its highest level since June 8th. The same can be said for Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Real Estate. For Consumer Staples, the sector's 10-day A/D line is at its highest level since June of 2019 and for Health Care it is at its highest level since May of 2019. In the case of Technology, it has been even longer as that sector's line is at its highest level since last April.

&gt; While broad participation is healthy for the long-term prospects of a rally, these 10-Day A/D lines have gotten extremely overbought in the near term, suggesting a cool-down period is likely in the days ahead.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-10-day.png))**

&gt; With short term breadth running very hot, the cumulative A/D lines of several sectors are breaking out to new highs as well. Utilities and Materials are the only sectors to have seen prices reach a new high in the past few days alongside their cumulative A/D lines. As for the other sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Materials, and Tech have also all seen new highs for cumulative breadth. The same applies to the S&amp;P 500, but again, none of these have yet to see price do the same.

&gt; # Election-Year October Market Performance Volatile since 1950

&gt; October’s history of volatility was recapped in the October Almanac as well as it being the worst performing month of election years since 1950. In the following chart we have plotted election-year October performance for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 since 1950 (NASDAQ since 1972 and Russell indexes since 1980) alongside their historical performance excluding gruesome election-year October 2008.

&gt; With or without October 2008, historical performance has been uninspiring in election years. Excluding 2008, October has generally started off on a positive note, but by around the fourth trading day, strength has tended to fade with weakness persisting until around the eighth trading day. Then a modest rally ensued through mid-month followed by more weakness and finally a rally to end the month. Grey shading highlights the two historical windows of weakness that could setup our Seasonal MACD indicators.

2020-10-08 13:36:52,r/stocks,Diversifying away from IT,"I started investing a few weeks ago and got exposed to IT probably too much (close to 50% of my portfolio). I would like to diversify to other sectors to rebalance my portfolio.

This is my current portfolio:  

Ticker | % | Industry
:--|:--|:--
MSFT | 17% | Technology
BABA | 12% | Retail/Wholesale
CSCO | 9% | Technology
AAPL | 8% | Technology

BIDU | 5% | Technology
BAYN | 4% | Healthcare
ABBV | 4% | Healthcare
TSLA | 3% | Automotive
NIO | 3% | Automotive
VWCE | 3% | ETF
TVRN | 2% | Healthcare
GOLD | 2% | Basic Materials
FB | 2% | Technology
BAC | 2% | Financial Services

This is my watchlist:

PEP | Consumer Goods
DIS | Entertainment
V | Financial Services
MA | Financial Services
JPM | Financial Services
UPS | Industrials
FDX | Industrials
PG | Consumer Goods
WMT | Retail/Wholesale
JNJ | Healthcare

The ""problem"" with these companies is that they are all huge and are going to grow at a lower rate, so I would prefer to have a mix of stocks with high potential (medium to high growth in the future) and more stable ones (like the ones on my watchlist).

Any suggestions about industries I should get into? What percentage should allocate for every industry approx.? What percentage of slow/medium/high growers should I have?

I know most of these questions are subjective and depends on every person's preferences, but I would like to have some guidance at least :)",0,0,davidsl88,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j7bgnz/diversifying_away_from_it/,j7bgnz

2020-10-05 21:29:26,r/stocks,Do I need options in my portfolio?,"Hello, I’m 19 years old and I just recently (about a month ago) got into stock. I’ve known about stocks for while and did research and I’ve been kinda obsessed with stocks. The last month, I researched everything so I’m not a “beginner” but I am at the same time. The thing is options scare me a bit because of how people lose large sums of money and I’m very foreign to the idea of options.

I have $18000 saved and I’m putting a percentage of my bi-weekly paychecks into stocks (around $150-$300 every two weeks). I want to move to Florida for film school and I’m trying to build my $18000 to $24000 (not only on the stock market but for it help). I’m moving there in February of next year.

So should options be a part of my portfolio or would I be fine just contributing into ETFS/individual stocks and getting my return that way. 


Here is my stock list I want to invest in through the year.

2020-09-23 23:16:08,r/stocks,Dow Falls 500 Points as Fed Warns More Stimulus Needed,"Stocks ended sharply lower Wednesday as central bank officials warned more fiscal stimulus was needed to rescue a struggling U.S. economy.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 525 points, or 1.92%, to 26,763, the S&amp;P 500 was off 2.37% and the Nasdaq fell 3.02%. 

Amazon.com  ([**AMZN**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/amzn)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=AMZN) finished down 4.1%, and Alphabet  ([**GOOGL**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/googl)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=GOOGL) declined 3.5%.

Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, like Fed Chairman Jerome Powell before him, said the central bank believed “additional fiscal support will likely be needed” to lift the U.S. economy out of its coronavirus-related downturn.

Powell warned Tuesday in congressional testimony that a U.S. recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 200,000 Americans, ""continues to be highly uncertain."" 

“The recovery will go faster if there’s support coming both from Congress and from the Fed,” Powell said.

Nike  ([**NKE**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/nke)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=NKE) was the leading gainer on the Dow, rising 8.8%, after the sports apparel and equipment giant posted [better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/nike-soars-to-all-time-high-digital-sales-lead-q1-earnings). Nike brand digital sales rose 82% overall in the quarter.

Johnson &amp; Johnson  ([**JNJ**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/jnj)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=JNJ) was little changed at $144.43 after the healthcare giant said it started the final round of testing for its coronavirus vaccine candidate.

Johnson &amp; Johnson said the single-shot dose, which will be tested on 60,000 trial participants, followed positive data from a Phase 2 trial. 

The company reiterated its goal of producing and supplying more than 1 billion doses of the vaccine - should it be cleared by regulators - through the course of 2021. It aims to have a decision on the vaccine's effectiveness either later this year or in the first months of 2021.

Tesla  ([**TSLA**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/tsla)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&amp;ticker=TSLA) shares declined 10% to $380.36 after the electric-car maker's battery presentation disappointed investors.

[CEO Elon Musk outlined his company’s ambitious battery manufacturing and cost-reduction goals](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/tesla-previews-next-gen-batteries-says-2020-deliveries-will-rise-30-to-40-percent) but detailed how long it might take for those goals to be reached.

Musk said the cheaper and more efficient batteries ultimately will let Tesla ""make a compelling $25,000 car that is also fully autonomous.""

[Tesla's Battery Day: A Rundown of What Was Revealed](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/tesla-outlined-ambitious-goals-for-ramping-battery-production-and-lowering-manufacturing-costs-but-shares-sold-off-as-details-were-discussed)

The new batteries, however, will take a while to ramp up. Tesla said the 4680 batteries won't reach mass production until 2022. Tesla set goals of having 100 gigawatt-hours of annual production capacity by 2022, and 3 terawatt-hours of capacity by 2030.

Global stocks remain on course for their first monthly drop since March. Prior to Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 had declined 5.3% in September, while the Nasdaq had dropped nearly 7%.

Stock markets have traded lower the first three weeks of September on fears that rising coronavirus infections worldwide could lead to further lockdowns and a lack of another U.S. fiscal stimulus package.

2020-09-23 22:25:17,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today, Sept 23. What a crazy day!","PsychoMarket Recap - September 23, 2020

Stocks turned sharply negative again, erasing yesterday’s gains and continuing the decline from the earlier week as investors weighed slowing economic data and the absence of fiscal stimulus. This was one of the worst sessions in September. The SPY finished 2.35% down, the Nasdaq 3.05% down and the Dow finished 1.93% down. 

Tech shares reversed yesterday’s course and sank, leading the broader market down. Big tech stocks, like Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG) finished around 2% down on average. 

Economic analysts were mostly bearish. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note, “It’s also pretty clear that the rates of recovery have slowed, with only retail sales having completed the V. You can thank the enhanced unemployment benefits for that – $600 per week for more than 30M people, at the peak. It’s hard to be optimistic about September and the fourth quarter, with the chance of a further relief bill before the election receding as Washington focuses on the Supreme Court”.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin once again addressed the urgent need for further stimulus in a testimony before the House Financial Services Committee yesterday. Powell underscored the limitations of the Federal Reserve’s lending powers. He said, “Many borrowers will benefit from these programs, as will the overall economy. But for others, a loan that could be difficult to repay might not be the answer. In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed.” Mnuchin added that he wanted to reauthorize measures under the Payment Protection Program (PPP) that offered forgivable loans to businesses that stayed open and kept most of their employees on payroll. Unfortunately, any reauthorization or reallocation of funds requires Congressional approval, something unlikely to happen with lawmakers unable to come to a consensus about stimulus and focused mainly on the Supreme Court.

**Highlights**

* Yesterday was Tesla’s (TSLA) battery day. The company laid out plans to $25,000 car and cut battery costs in half over the next three years.

2020-09-23 22:00:25,r/stocks,Warren Buffett’s greatest investing mistake was an emotional decision that cost him more than 120 billion dollars.,"“In 1964, Stanton made an oral tender offer of $11​ 1⁄2 per share for the company to buyback Buffett's shares. Buffett agreed to the deal. A few weeks later, Warren Buffett received the tender offer in writing, but the tender offer was for only $11 ​3⁄8. Buffett later admitted that this lower, undercutting offer made him angry.\[16\] Instead of selling at the slightly lower price, Buffett decided to buy more of the stock to take control of the company and fire Stanton (which he did). However, this put Buffett in a situation where he was now the majority owner of a textile business that was failing.

In 2010, Buffett claimed that purchasing Berkshire Hathaway was the biggest investment mistake he had ever made, and claimed that it had denied him compounded investment returns of about $200 billion over the subsequent 45 years.\[16\] Buffett claimed that had he invested that money directly in insurance businesses instead of buying out Berkshire Hathaway (due to what he perceived as a slight by an individual), those investments would have paid off several hundredfold”

&amp;#x200B;

Just thought it was interesting. Investing is more of a test of personality rather than IQ. If you buy and hold onto only good companies (Apple, Amazon, Costco, McDonalds, jnj, Brk, O etc...) you could easily do well for yourself. Even if some of them end up being bad picks like GE. 

But what’s worse than having a bad pick is probably making a single emotional decision. FOMO,  selling a good innovative company early on because you're scared of losing your 1.5-2x gains, liquidating everything because you’re scared of a market crash and so forth.

# **Investors will look to the Fed to soothe the market next week, but that may be a tall order  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/11/investors-will-look-to-the-fed-to-soothe-the-market-next-week-but-that-may-be-a-tall-order.html)**
*****
&gt; Markets are looking to the Federal Reserve to be a soothing force when it meets in the week ahead, but stocks could remain choppy if the central bank disappoints and as investors focus on the election and the economic recovery.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s two-day meeting is expected to end Wednesday with minor tweaks to its statement and some clarity on how it plans to use forward guidance. The Fed also updates its economic and interest rate outlook, including forecasts for 2023 for the first time.
*****
&gt; But Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at Prudential Financial, said the stock market could easily be disappointed because the Fed is unlikely to offer more clarity on monetary policy, such as plans for bond buying.
*****
&gt; “The market is concerned the Fed is not going to give us explicit readings on their plans for monetary policy,″ she said. The Fed’s extraordinary policies have been an important factor behind the stock market’s 50% surge from the March 23 low, and it’s also seen as a major factor limiting the depth of the market’s sell-off.
*****
&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the Fed is not likely to tweak much and it continues to buy $80 billion a month in Treasurys. “I don’t think they’ll do anything to the markets either way,” he said.
*****
&gt; Stocks were volatile in the past week, falling hard, rallying, falling and rallying again. That left the S&amp;P 500 with a weekly decline of about 2.5%, its worst week since June. The harder hit Nasdaq was down about 4.1% for the week, its worst weekly decline since March. The quadruple expiration of options and futures at the end of the coming week could add to the volatility.
*****
&gt; Bank of America strategists said the bond market is watching the Fed for any balance sheet adjustments and the changes to its forward guidance, which includes the Fed’s recent tweak in its inflation policy. The Fed changed its policy of focusing on a target inflation rate to an average rate, meaning it may not tighten policy if inflation overshoots its 2% target.
*****
&gt; “We see risk the rates market is underwhelmed by the guidance provided by the Fed, which would support higher back-end rates and a steeper curve,” the Bank of America strategists noted. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield slid in the past week, touching 0.67% Friday, and it could move higher, meaning bonds may sell-off, if the Fed does not clarify policy around its bond buying program.
*****
&gt; Krosby said the stock market is hoping for a dovish Fed. “The market needs that now because fiscal policy is going nowhere,” she said.
*****
&gt; BTIG strategist Julian Emanuel said the market could focus on the fact that Congress failed to make headway on fiscal stimulus, if the economic data begins to disappoint.
*****
&gt; Retail sales for August are expected Wednesday morning, as the Fed meets. They are expected to rise by 1%, and that should be an important look at whether the lack of enhanced unemployment benefits, which expired July 31, impacted consumer spending. Among other things, Republicans and Democrats could not agree how to replace the $600 weekly payment to the unemployed.
*****
&gt; “Depending on the polls and the economic data, the probability of stimulus rises and falls,” said Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy.
*****
&gt; “Our view is that next week is just going to be lots of back and forth with the potential for a further extension of the range for the downside, if the political narrative gets more inflamed,” said Emanuel. Emanuel expects the market to remain choppy and fall further into the month of October, as investors worry about the uncertainty around the presidential election.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s meeting this week is its last before the election, and analysts expect Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to sound reassuring that the Fed will do whatever it takes to support the economy. Powell holds a briefing after the meeting Wednesday, and he is expected to also be asked about the potential for higher inflation. The Fed has said it is more concerned about disinflation, but recent inflation data has been hotter than expected, though still well below 2%.
*****
&gt; “There is a tug of war between those who say buy chips now because inflation is moving higher, versus those why are saying deflationary forces are still weaving their way into the economy,” said Krosby.
*****
&gt; Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said he expects the Fed to sound reassuring but it’s not likely to discuss a target for bond purchases or the yield curve controls some investors were hoping for. Yield curve control would mean the Fed would try to manage interest rates by targeting its purchases of specific Treasurys. For instance, it may focus on trying to keep longer duration yields lower, and buy the 10-year.
*****
&gt; Chandler also noted the Fed’s $7 trillion balance sheet has recently declined by about $100 billion from its peak, and its bond purchases are falling behind the European Central Bank.
*****
&gt; “My sense is the Fed is going to keep saying it’s not worried about inflation. Its bigger worry is downside risks. They’ll repeat their call for fiscal stimulus which after this week seems less likely,” he said.
*****
&gt; Chandler said the stock market could remain choppy in the coming week, but he does not expect a sharp selloff. The dollar could decline, if the Fed sounds dovish, and that is a positive for stocks.
*****
&gt; “I don’t think a 10% pullback [in Nasdaq] has caused enough pain to have people capitulate. This is just an ordinary correction, and we’re going to make new highs,” he said.

&gt; # Election Charts You Need To See: Part 1

&gt; First off, our thoughts go out to everyone who was impacted by the tragic events of September 11, 2001—19 years ago today. It is a day to reflect and remember those who were lost.

&gt; One of the top requests we’ve had here at LPL Research is for more charts on the election. Over the next week, we will share some of our favorite charts on this very important subject.

&gt; Here’s how the S&amp;P 500 Index performs under various presidents and congressional makeups. The best scenario has historically been a Democratic president and Republican Congress, while a Republican president and Democratic Congress has been the weakest.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Building on this, a split Congress historically has been one of the best scenarios for investors.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The best scenario under a Republican president is a split Congress, a potential positive for 2020 that has played out after the massive reversal in the stock market since March.

&gt; Looking at the four-year presidential cycle shows that stocks haven’t been down during a year the president was up for a re-election since FDR in the 1940s, another bullish tailwind for 2020.

&gt; Here’s another look at this, as stocks historically have done much better when there isn’t a lame duck president.

&gt; # Active Managers Do an About Face

&gt; The National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) has an index which tracks the exposure of its members to US equity markets. Each week, members are asked to provide a number that represents their exposure to markets. A reading of -200 means they are leveraged short, -100 indicates fully short, 0 is neutral, 100% is fully invested, and 200% indicates leveraged long. Two weeks ago, in our Bespoke Report, we highlighted the fact that the exposure index had moved to one of the highest levels in its 15-year history. Now, just two weeks later, these same active managers have reigned in their exposure considerably as this week's reading dropped from just under 100 to 53.1.

&gt; This week's drop was the second-largest one week decline in the index's history and just the 10th time that the index lost more than a third (33 points) in a single week. The most recent occurrence was back in early March in the middle of the Covid crash, and every other prior period where the index saw a similar drop, the S&amp;P 500 was also down every time by an average of 2.3%. Therefore, it's not much of a surprise to see the big drop this week given the big declines in the market. But what about going forward? Do big drops in the NAAIM Index mean a bounce back for markets or further declines?

&gt; # The Most and Least Heavily Shorted Stocks in the Russell 1,000

&gt; Below is an updated look at the most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000. Each of these 30 stocks has at least 15% of its equity float sold short.

&gt; At the top of the list is Nordstrom (JWN) with 38.66% of its float sold short. With a YTD decline of 61.86%, the shorts have crushed it with JWN this year.

&gt; With its huge portfolio of office and retail real estate, Brookfield Property REIT(BPYU) has the second highest short interest in the Russell 1,000 at 33.7%. BPYU is down 35.7% YTD.

&gt; There are plenty of other well-known companies on the list of the most heavily shorted stocks. Examples include American Airlines (AAL), Virgin Galactic (SPCE), LendingTree (TREE), Wayfair (W), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), ADT, TripAdvisor (TRIP), Beyond Meat (BYND), and Kohl's (KSS).

&gt; One name that is no longer on the list of most shorted stocks is Tesla (TSLA). When we provided an update on short interest back in February (a pre-COVID world), Tesla (TSLA) had more than 17% of its float sold short, but that number is all the way down to 8.3% as of the most recent filing.

&gt; These 30 stocks with the highest short interest are down an average of 3.01% since last Wednesday (9/2) when the S&amp;P 500 made its last closing high. That's actually a little bit better than the 3.55% average decline for the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000. And year-to-date, these 30 stocks are up an average of 0.60% versus an average gain of 0.81% for the rest of the index. That's not much of a difference!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/most-heavily-shorted.png))**

&gt; Below is a list of the 30 least shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 as a percentage of equity float. None of these stocks have more than 0.71% of their float sold short, and they're mostly made up of more conservative names in the Health Care and Consumer Staples sectors.

&gt; Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) has the lowest short interest as a percentage of float in the Russell 1,000 at just 0.36%. Microsoft (MSFT) -- one of the key mega-cap Tech names -- has the second lowest short interest, followed by Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Medtronic (MDT).

&gt; Somewhat surprisingly, Amazon (AMZN) is the sixth least shorted stock in the entire Russell 1,000. While AMZN is still thought of as a high-flying momentum name by many investors, its short interest levels tell a much different story, painting it as more of a non-cyclical stock like Pepsi (PEP), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), or Coca- Cola (KO).

&gt; While the 30 most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up 0.60% YTD, the 30 least shorted stocks in the index are up much more at +8%. This group has MSFT, AMZN, HD, and AAPL to thank for that strong performance!

&gt; # 5 Lessons Learned About Rising Rates

&gt; While the direction of the 10-year Treasury yield over the last cycle was decidedly lower, as shown in LPL’s Chart of the Day, there were still six extended periods where it rose at least 0.75%, and in two of those it rose almost 2%. Looking ahead, economic growth below potential, slack in the labor market, and an extremely supportive Federal Reserve (Fed) may limit rate pressure in the near term, but with interest rates already low and massive stimulus in place, we believe the overall direction is likely to be higher.

&gt; “Even in a falling rate period there are lessons from the last cycle about rising rates,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “Among them: Careful when the Fed stops buying and sometimes the best defense is a good offense.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; While every economic cycle is unique, the last cycle highlighted these key takeaways about periods of rising rates:

&gt; * **Careful when the Fed stops buying.**  The two drivers of rising rates last cycle were economic growth and Fed bond purchases, also known as quantitative easing (QE). The Fed buys bonds to keep rates down, but the start of Fed buying has actually been the time when rates rise—likely on expectations that the purchases would help strengthen the economy. These periods also often followed large rate declines either because markets anticipated the start of Fed buying or the economy was faltering. The takeaway: unless the economy is really taking off, any rising-rate period may pause for an extended period, or even reverse, when the Fed backs off bond purchases.
&gt; * **Sometime the best defense is a good offense.** Lower-quality, more economically sensitive bond sectors actually performed well during periods of rising rates during the last cycle. Rate gains were largely driven by economic improvement rather than a large pick-up in inflation, and that’s typically a good environment for sectors like high-yield bonds and bank loans. The downside is that these are much riskier bond sectors and don’t provide the potential diversification benefits of higher-quality bonds during periods of stock declines.
&gt; * **Don’t expect TIPS to provide much resilience because of their inflation adjustment.** Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are high-quality bonds that have provided a little extra insulation against rising rates compared to similarly dated Treasuries when inflation expectations increased. TIPS prices are adjusted for inflation, but even with the adjustment, they are still very sensitive to rates.
&gt; * **Investment-grade corporates can both hurt and help.** If credit spreads narrow when rates are rising, investment-grade corporates can post some solid gains in a rising-rate environment, but if spreads are holding steady or even widening, they can be very sensitive to changes in Treasury yields, potentially (although not often) even more sensitive than Treasuries.
&gt; * **Mortgage-backed securities (MBS)** have not provided as much insulation as corporates, but they also have had less downside. While MBS have certainly outperformed Treasuries during periods of rising rates, they have not performed as well as investment-grade corporates. But they also have come with less downside, losing only 1.4% in their worst performing period compared to a 4% loss during the worst period for corporates.
With the Fed still providing strong stimulus and economic growth potentially poised to accelerate, we currently see an increased risk of rates moving higher. We are playing some offense with our equity exposure, which allows us to emphasize a focus on higher-quality bonds. Among bond sectors, we are emphasizing MBS and still prefer investment-grade corporates over Treasuries. History may not repeat, but if it rhymes, this positioning may help add resilience to a fixed income portfolio if rates extend their move off recent lows.

&gt; # Best and Worst Performing Stocks Since the 9/2 High

&gt; Since the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq peaked on September 2nd, we've seen rotation out of the post-COVID winners and rotation into laggards in the value space. Below we take a look at the best and worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 since the 9/2 high for the S&amp;P. For each stock, we also include its YTD total return and its percentage change from the 3/23 COVID Crash low through 9/2.

&gt; Capri Holdings (CPRI) is up more than any other stock in the Russell 1,000 since 9/2 with a gain of 17.43%. Even after the recent gains, however, Capri -- the holding company for brands like Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo, and Versace -- is still down 52.9% year-to-date.

&gt; Only four other stocks are up more than 10% since 9/2 -- Beyond Meat (BYND), PVH, Virtu Financial (VIRT), and Reinsurance Group (RGA). Interestingly, BYND and VIRT are also up big (~80%) year-to-date, while PVH and RGA are both down more than 35% year-to-date.

&gt; What stands out the most about the list of winners is that only one Technology stock made the cut -- Sabre (SABR). Most names come from the two consumer sectors including cruise-liners like Carnival (CCL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise (NCLH), Kohl's (KSS), Williams-Sonoma (WSM), Six Flags (SIX), Foot Locker (FL), and Ralph Lauren (RL). Both UBER and LYFT also made the cut with gains of 6% since 9/2. The 30 biggest winners since 9/2 are still down an average of 20% year-to-date, while the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up an average of 1.46% YTD.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/bestsince92.png))**

&gt; While only one Technology stock made the list of biggest winners since 9/2, the sector accounts for two-thirds of the 30 biggest losers over the same time frame. As shown below, since 9/2, the six worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 and ten of the worst twelve all come from Tech. Notably, though, these 30 stocks that have all fallen more than 12% since 9/2 are still up an average of 5.6% YTD. Were it not for the horrid YTD performance of the Energy stocks that made the list, the average YTD gain would be even higher.

&gt; # Typical Early September Weakness Recovers Mid-Month Sells Off Month-End

&gt; As of yesterday’s close the market was down more than the historical average performance in September. DJIA was down nearly -3.3%, S&amp;P 500 was down -4.8%, NASDAQ was off 7.9%, Russell 1000 was down -5.2% and Russell 2000 lost 3.7%. Today’s rally looks like the beginning of a textbook mid-month recovery rally However, the second half of September has historically been weaker than the first half. The week after options expiration week can be treacherous with S&amp;P 500 logging 23 weekly losses in 30 years since 1990. End-of-quarter portfolio restructuring, and window dressing can amplify the impacts of any negative headlines.

2020-08-27 03:54:13,r/stocks,Tesla Is Now Worth $400 Billion,"The world’s most valuable car company just hit another milestone.

Tesla ￼’s (ticker: TSLA) market capitalization on Wednesday topped $400 billion. About two months ago, it was celebrating $200 billion. It first hit $100 billion in January.

Tesla passed Johnson &amp; Johnson ￼ (JNJ) along the way on Wednesday, in terms of market cap. There are only seven companies in the S&amp;P 500 index worth more, including Visa ￼ (V) at $447 billon and Apple ￼ (AAPL) at $2.16 trillion.

There is a lot you could buy for $400 billion. Here are a few notable   comparisons to put that figure in context.

It’s more than the combined value of every team in the four major U.S. professional sports, according to Forbes estimates. It’s also more than the Forbes estimate for the combined net worth of Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Tesla’s own CEO Elon Musk.

It’s nearly four times International Business Machines ￼’ (IBM) market cap.

You could buy 400 billion things at a dollar store—or just buy Dollar General ￼ (DG) and Dollar Tree ￼ (DLTR).

It’s also more than the individual gross domestic product of Israel, Ireland, and Hong Kong.

With $400 billion, you could also stockpile about 181 billion regular gallons of gas, based on AAA’s U.S. estimates. You could drive 5.79 trillion miles, if you averaged 32 miles per gallon. That would take you around the Earth 232.5 million times.

If you are into electric vehicles, $400 billion could get you 10.53 million of Tesla’s basic 2020 Model 3. Of course, such a sale would cause price targets to soar. And Tesla would need a few more factories to turn out that many vehicles. The company only delivered about 90,000 vehicles in the second quarter.

# **Markets look to the Fed again to build on S&amp;P 500 record as Congress continues to disappoint  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/markets-look-to-the-fed-again-to-build-on-sp-500-record-as-congress-continues-to-disappoint.html)**
*****
&gt; Market pros hold out little hope that Congress will agree to a stimulus package before September, but they will look to Jerome Powell in the coming week to provide a roadmap for what else the Fed might do to help the economy.
*****
&gt; The Fed holds its annual Jackson Hole symposium starting Thursday, and it will conduct the Kansas City Fed-sponsored meeting virtually rather than against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons as it normally does at this time of year. The Fed chairman speaks Thursday morning on the implications for monetary policy and the Fed’s anticipated policy framework review.
*****
&gt; The past week was a big week for markets, with the S&amp;P 500 finally recovering its losses from the pandemic selloff and setting new all-time highs. Stocks have been big beneficiaries of the Fed’s easy policies and low interest rates, and Fed officials are widely expected to sound dovish when they meet in the coming week.
*****
&gt; “I think we know the Fed’s all in. If anything they want the mechanicals to work right,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. “The basic Fed policy is crystal clear. You’re going to have low rates for the foreseeable future. They will do whatever it takes.”
*****
&gt; But Fed watchers expect Powell to go further than the Fed’s already extraordinary support for the economy and financial conditions, and offer guidance on new language and policies that will help the markets understand how long it might hold those low rates and extraordinary policies in place.
*****
&gt; For instance, the Fed was expected to provide a more explicit forward guidance policy, and it could also introduce inflation averaging, meaning the Fed could specify that it could both undershoot and overshoot its 2% inflation target. Inflation has only occasionally surpassed its target over the past dozen years, since the financial crisis.
*****
&gt; Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, said he expects the Fed will introduce forward guidance and average inflation targeting at its September meeting. He expects the Fed’s policy review to examine all of its policies to determine which work best in different circumstances.
*****
&gt; Since the markets collapsed in February and March, the Fed has cut rates to zero and helped increase liquidity with different facilities for different areas of the capital markets like commercial paper, municipal bonds and corporate bonds. It also created lending programs and continues to buy a large amount of Treasury securities and mortgages. Its balance sheet has now ballooned to $7 trillion.
*****
&gt; With average inflation targeting, the Fed would allow the economy and inflation to run hotter than target, without immediately taking steps to tighten policy, according to Jim Caron, fixed income portfolio manger with Morgan Stanley Investment Management.
*****
&gt; “What they’re saying is if the economy starts to recover, let’s say we get a vaccine, or the rate of infection goes down, and the equity market is on a tear, they’re not going to stop it,” said Caron. “They’re going to stay there for awhile. That’s what they’re trying to communicate.”
*****
&gt; # Where’s the stimulus?
&gt; As markets await clarity from the Fed, market pros are expecting less from Congress after first initially anticipating a stimulus package by early August.
*****
&gt; “At this point, the thing I’m most thinking about is are we going to get a stimulus deal or not,” said Keon. “I think the politics are shifting beneath that.” He said some Republicans in Congress may be less inclined to spend on a big package ahead of the election.
*****
&gt; Democrats and Republicans have been far apart in terms of the contents of the package. One hot button issue is the $600 supplemental weekly aid for the unemployed. It expired on July 31, and Republicans want to cut it to $200 a week while Democrats want to keep current levels. The White House meanwhile has moved to provide $300 a week in aid from FEMA funds but the states have to process those payments.
*****
&gt; The two parties are also still far apart on the size of the package, after initially starting out with Democrats at $3 trillion and Republicans with $1 trillion.
*****
&gt; “Some folks are discovering their inner budget hawks. It looks like the positions of the two sides are moving further away rather than closer together,” said Keon. “As the election moves up on us, the possibilities of a deal are going down...the markets are slowly moving toward the idea we don’t get stimulus deal and we might get a Biden presidency. It’s not panicking about it.”
*****
&gt; The Democratic party held its convention this past week, formally nominating former vice president Joseph Biden to head the Democratic ticket. The Republican convention begins Monday. Biden leads President Donald Trump by an average 7.4 percentage points in the major polls, according to RealClearPolitics.com.
*****
&gt; Michael Schumacher, director rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said he too is becoming more skeptical a stimulus deal will get done. “As the election season gets going, it appears to be getting harder and harder, not from a timing standpoint but from a lack of goodwill standpoint,” he said.
*****
&gt; Strategists said if the economic data weakens, that could hurt stocks and get Congress back to negotiating a new package. There had been expectations a package would include a one-time payment for individuals and families, enhanced unemployment payments and aid for state and local governments.
*****
&gt; Raymond James Washington policy analyst Ed Mills said the two sides are likely to come together, but without a catalyst forcing them it may wait until they need to pass a continuing resolution on the budget Sept. 30. “Democrats are not going to allow for an appropriations bill to pass that does not include additional support for the economy,” said Mills.
*****
&gt; # It’s the economy
&gt; There is some key data in the week ahead that should show how manufacturing and the consumer are faring.
*****
&gt; Durable good is reported Wednesday, while personal income and spending data is reported Friday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Friday.
*****
&gt; Energy markets will be keeping a close eye on two tropical storms that are heading into the Gulf of Mexico and could make landfall early Wednesday. One storm, Laura is tracking close to Florida, and a second storm, possibly to be named Marco looks to be heading across the Yucatan Peninsula before entering the Gulf.
*****
&gt; It would be unprecedented in the era of satellites and modern hurricane tracking technology for two storms to arrive within 24 hours. The Weather Channel reports there was such an occurrence in September, 1933.

&gt; # September Almanac: Only Modest Improvement in Election Years

&gt; Start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e4e433c87c6e4c76cefda4ccffbf5ab0/cfdd6d36ba180c35-7f/s400x600/836cc65ffaba5c46d56ea4566614d200638be344.jpg))**

&gt; Bullish election-year forces do little to improve on September’s poor overall performance over the same time frame. September’s performance does improve slightly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board. Only the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post modest 0.2% and 0.8% average gains respectively in the last ten election year Septembers.

&gt; # 5 Charts To See With Stocks At New Highs

&gt; “Better late than never.”

&gt; It took a while, but the S&amp;P 500 Index finally made a new all-time high, coming all the way back from the vicious 34% bear market in less than six months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pic-8.19.20-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; It might bring back some scary memories, but back in March it took the S&amp;P 500 only 16 days to go from new highs to a bear market (down 20%), the fastest ever.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “This will go down as the fastest bear market ever, but also one of the fastest recoveries ever,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Then again, we’ve never quite seen a recession and recovery like this, so maybe it isn’t a shock to see new highs this quickly.”

&gt; The bear officially lasted one month and took five months to recover the losses. Usually when there’s a bear market during a recession, it takes 30 months to recover those loses. This was the third-fastest ever, with only 3 months to recover from a bear market recession in the early ‘80s and 4 months to recover from a bear market in the early ‘90s.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; It seems like earlier this year and new highs were a lifetime ago, but the S&amp;P 500 finally moved off unlucky 13, notching the 14th new high of 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, returns after a long time without new highs actually get better. One, three, six, and 12 months after the first new high in more than five months show stronger performance than average or after any new highs. Yet another reason to think that this bull market from a long-term point of view could have some more tricks up its sleeve.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-5.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Last, we found there were four other times the S&amp;P 500 made a new high during a recession: In February ’61, July ’80, November ’82, and March ’91. Incredibly, a new expansion started the following month every single time. Could stocks at new highs be signaling an end to this recession? We think that very well could be the case again this time.

&gt; # Largest S&amp;P 500 Stocks + Tesla (TSLA)

&gt; Tesla (TSLA) is now up 50% over the last 10 calendar days dating back to August 11th. This has propelled the company way up the list of the largest US companies.

&gt; Below is a table of the largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 with Tesla (TSLA) included. As shown, Tesla's $382.7 billion market cap would rank it as the 9th largest stock in the S&amp;P 500 were it in the index.

&gt; On August 11th, Tesla's market cap was just $256 billion, so over the last ten days it has leapfrogged companies like Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), JP Morgan (JPM), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Mastercard (MA), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Next up would be Visa (V) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), which have market caps just under $400 billion. Click here to view Bespoke's premium membership options for our best research available.

&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - Earnings Season and Top Triple Plays

&gt; Walmart (WMT) wrapped up the Q2 2020 earnings reporting period on Tuesday with a huge beat on both the top and bottom line. It was a fitting end to what turned out to be a record-setting earnings season.

&gt; As we highlighted in our Q2 Earnings Season preview in early July, analysts were rapidly increasing earnings estimates leading up to earnings season. Normally when that happens, stocks have trouble performing well during earnings season because the expectations bar has been set higher. This season, even with analyst estimates on the rise in the four weeks leading up to the start of the reporting period, companies managed to beat bottom-line EPS estimates at the highest rate in the history of our database going back to 1999.

&gt; As shown below, 76% of companies reported stronger-than-expected EPS numbers this season, which eclipsed the prior record high of 73% seen during the Q3 2006 reporting period.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/beatratesbyquarter.png))**

&gt; Long-term Bespoke subscribers know how much we like earnings triple plays, but for those that haven’t heard of the term, we came up with it back in the mid-2000s. An earnings triple play is a company that beats EPS estimates, beats revenue estimates, and raises forward guidance all in the same quarterly earnings report. Investopedia.com is one of the best online resources for financial markets education, and they’ve actually given us credit for coining the “triple play” term on their website. We consider triple play stocks to be the cream of the crop of earnings season, and we are constantly finding new long-term buy opportunities from this basket of names each quarter.

&gt; This earnings season there were a massive number of earnings triple plays. We went through the list of this season's triple plays to find the ones that have the most attractive set-ups heading into the earnings off-season.

1) I have some stocks I do believe in ( MSFT, JNJ, PEP, few other blue chip companies) , should I sell them since etfs will probably be exposed to them or should I keep my positions? 
 
2) ETF’s on my radar are VOO/VTI/VYM , ARKK/ARKF/ARKW ,  and BST/QYLD as an income fund/ psuedo savings account. QYLD is low volatile and I am able to drip more shares each month already, but BST has growth which is better since I’m young and has less yield, but I’m leaning toward them. I’m open to reading up on others as well. 

I’m very bullish on Tech/fintech/cloud, I have a few shares of QQQ/WCLD and they’ve been great it seems.  Any recommendations for forming an etf portfolio? 


3) I will be holding them in my taxable account for whatever that’s worth

# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/17/earnings-and-fiscal-debate-could-be-catalysts-for-stocks-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Investors are braced for a barrage of earnings news, and the debate in Washington around the next stimulus package may also be an important catalyst for markets since it has implications for the economic recovery.
*****
&gt; Big tech names, including Microsoft, Intel, Twitter and IBM, are among companies reporting in the week ahead, as is high-flying Tesla. Blue chips Coca-Cola, Verizon, American Express and Travelers are also among the dozens of major companies releasing results.
*****
&gt; Congress returns from its break and should pick up the pace of negotiations towards a new fiscal stimulus package, which is expected to address aid for state and local governments and enhanced unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefits, including the $600 additional weekly payment now going to millions, is expected to be a hot topic of discussion, as the benefit ends on July 31.
*****
&gt; There are just a few items of note on the economic calendar, including existing home sales on Wednesday, unemployment claims data on Thursday and new home sales on Friday.
*****
&gt; The spread of the coronavirus will also be closely monitored, as well as any signs of medical progress. The Lancet medical journal is expected to release early stage human trial data Monday on a vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca.
*****
&gt; # ‘Push and pull’ in market
&gt; Investors also will be watching the market’s own dynamics in the week ahead. There is tension within the market between the bubbly run-up of tech and momentum names on the Nasdaq, and the broader market, or S&amp;P 500, which is basically still flat for the year. The Nasdaq is up 17% year to date, but in the past week lagged other indices, turning in a loss, while the Dow and S&amp;P 500 were both higher.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq’s outperformance came to an abrupt end Monday, and it has lagged since then. In dramatic fashion, the index rose sharply to new highs, with many big tech names and Tesla also hitting highs. Within the same session, there was a massive reversal in the index and in tech and momentum names, and they closed sharply lower.
*****
&gt; Now strategists are watching to see if the froth will be let out slowly or blow off in a big move that takes the rest of the market with it.
*****
&gt; “We expect the push and pull of the Nasdaq to continue and have sustained volatility, in our view, throughout the earnings season,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG. “Volatility could be to the upside, as well as the downside, but in our view, in aggregate, the Nasdaq is likely to correct.”
*****
&gt; Emanuel said the volatile reversal in the Nasdaq does not bode well for the Nasdaq, and it could see a 10% correction. There’s been a surge of retail activity in some of the frothiest names, such as Tesla, which surged from about $1,000 at the end of June to a high of $1,795 during Monday’s session. It is since about $300 per share lower.
*****
&gt; “The combination of public participation and just incredible valuations makes the sector very, very vulnerable. ... It’s the sector with the highest earnings expectations,” said Emanuel. “There’s virtually nothing that management can say at these valuations that’s going to create further upside to these names.”
*****
&gt; Tesla and Microsoft report earnings Wednesday, and Twitter reports Thursday.
*****
&gt; # A bump up in stimulus
&gt; As Congress heads back to Washington in the coming week, expectations are rising that the fiscal stimulus package could be slightly more than Republicans were previously expected to approve.
*****
&gt; When Congress broke for the July 4 holiday, there was a big divide on how much stimulus should be added, on top of the $2.4 trillion already adopted. The Democratic proposal was for $3 trillion, while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said no more than $1 trillion. Now the gulf has narrowed, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the $1.3 trillion under discussions is not enough.
*****
&gt; Cornerstone Macro’s Andy Laperriere said the package could now be $1.5 trillion or more, more than he expected just several weeks ago. He said more money is now expected for state and local governments, local schools, public health, virus testing and payments to support individuals..
*****
&gt; “Republicans really want to use this bill to encourage and incentivize businesses and schools to open. But I think the big thing is a month ago, the top priority of Republicans was to keep this bill small,” he said.
*****
&gt; One of the most controversial elements of the CARES stimulus package was the $600 weekly payment to people who were already collecting unemployment.
*****
&gt; The payment is likely to be significantly reduced and then ultimately phased out, but that will only come after compromise. “There’s going to be some lines-in-the-sand issues, and this is one of them,” said Laperriere, head of policy at Cornerstone.
*****
&gt; President Donald Trump has said he won’t sign the bill unless there is a payroll tax cut, which was previously rejected by Congress. Payroll taxes are paid by both employers and employees, and they fund government programs, including Medicare and Social Security.
*****
&gt; Strategists said the market could react to the deliberations if they take longer than expected, or the funds are viewed as insufficient.
*****
&gt; Michael Schumacher, Wells Fargo director of rate strategy, said the bond market will focus on how quickly the government plans to payout the stimulus and also the degree to which the Treasury will ultimately have to increase auction sizes to pay for it.
*****
&gt; If Congress keeps to its schedule, it needs to approve the package before the end of the month, when it heads to another recess for the entire month of August.

# The Good and the Bad from Earnings This Week

&gt; Earnings season began at the start of this week with Pepsi (PEP) and the first of the major US banks and brokers reporting Q2 numbers. It was a light week with only 32 companies reporting through Thursday, but in the coming weeks, we'll see 100+ reports on multiple trading days.

&gt; From our Earnings Explorer tool, below is a recap of the results from this week's earnings reports. 78% of companies that reported this week beat consensus analyst EPS estimates, while 72% topped consensus sales estimates. Those are both strong numbers. In terms of future projections, 16% of companies raised guidance, and not one company lowered guidance. That's rare even with the very low number of reports so far.

&gt; While guidance and beat rates were strong, investors still used earnings reports as an opportunity to sell. The average one-day share price change this week for companies in reaction to their earnings reports was a decline of 0.57%. All of those declines came on the initial gap down at the open, however. After averaging a gap down of 0.76% at the open of trading following the earnings release, the average stock that reported gained 0.21% from the open to the close. (The gap down of 0.76% and the open to close gain of 0.21% adds up to the full-day decline of 0.57% mentioned earlier.)

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/earnings.png))**

&gt; Below is a table showing all 32 companies that reported Q2 numbers this week (through Thursday). The list is sorted by one-day share price reaction from best to worst. Alcoa (AA) had the best price reaction to earnings this week with a gain of 6.39% yesterday. WNS Global (WNS) put up the second-biggest gain at 6.36%. The next best-performing stocks in reaction to earnings this week only gained 3%+ -- USB and HOMB. Other stocks that reported this week that gained in response to their earnings reports include Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GS), Taiwan Semi (TSM), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and JP Morgan (JPM).

&gt; On the downside, AngioDynamics (ANGO) saw the worst share price reaction to earnings this week when it fell 11.51% on Thursday. Sleep Number (SNBR) was second-worst with a one-day drop of 9.19% yesterday as well.

&gt; While MS, GS, and JPM all posted gains in reaction to earnings this week, other banks like Citi (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Bank of America (BAC) reacted negatively with each falling 4% or more.

# Retail Sales Beat Again

&gt; Retail sales data for June was reported on Thursday, handily beating expectations for the second consecutive month. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, June saw a 7.5% increase month over month, compared with Bloomberg’s consensus expectations for a 5% gain. This comes on the heels of a more than 18% gain in May, but also following by far the lowest reading ever, a 14.7% decline in April.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.17.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Pent-up demand and the continued easing of lockdowns during June likely contributed to the large increase, which saw sales rise across most categories. Sales spiked 8.2% at auto dealers, but even sales excluding autos and gas rose 6.7%. Clothing store sales more than doubled (+105.1%) while sales in the hard-hit food services and drinking places climbed 20%.

&gt; “Consumer spending is still far below pre-pandemic levels and many of the real-time data we are monitoring have begun to level off in the past month,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We remain encouraged by the strong rebound in May and June, but would expect more gradual gains for retail sales in the second half of the year.”

# Why A Potential Democrat Sweep May Not Be A Market Worry

&gt; Based on the latest polling data, there’s growing consensus that former Vice President Joe Biden potentially may win the election and Democrats possibly may sweep Congress. Some might think this could be a negative for stocks, as a higher corporate tax rate that reduces earnings could be part of the Democratic platform.

&gt; Early writers of the US Constitution were worried about one party having too much power that could enable factions in Washington, DC, to enact more extreme policies and political ideals, upsetting the carefully balanced apple cart. As we noted in our recently released Midyear Outlook 2020, stocks historically have performed quite well when Congress has been split, although stocks actually have done better than most probably realized when the Democrats were in full control.

&gt; “Higher corporate taxes are quite likely should we see a potential Democratic sweep,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But to blindly say stocks will do poorly is quite a stretch, as historically stocks have done rather well under this .”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 Index has been higher 9 of the past 10 times and 15 of the past 18 times Democrats controlled both the White House and Congress. Although LPL Research anticipates a likely split Congress in November, with the list of overall worries growing, we don’t think a potential Democratic sweep should be at the top of investors’ list of worries.

# Best of July Likely Over

&gt; NASDAQ’s mid-year rally came to an end on Tuesday, July 14. During the rally’s 12-day stretch beginning on the third to last day of June through the ninth trading day in July, NASDAQ gained 4.7%. This is well above its average performance since 1985 but less than half of its best showing from 1999. At NASDAQ’s high close during the rally on July 10 it was up 6.0%. Historically around this time in July is when the market has begun to weaken as NASDAQ’s full-month average performance is just 0.9% since 1985.

&gt; In the following chart, July’s seasonal pattern over the last 21 years has been plotted with July 2020, plotted on the right axis for comparison through yesterday’s close. This July’s well above average performance so far called for a second, larger range in order to aid in the comparison. Over the last 21 years the market’s trend has been lower beginning right around mid-month through the close. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 &amp; 2000 have on average given back some or all of their first half of July gains.

Things I'm thinking of:

1. Overweight in REITS (looking to get out of ABR and STAG positions, flush out WPC and MPW)
2. No exposure to telecoms
3. No exposure to tech (I hate the valuations here). I know tech will likely continue to grow and boom over time and I will likely pick up a growth ETF once I have built out the rest of my portfolio just for some capital appreciation but tech doesn't tend to fit with my investment style. Most tech stocks don't pay dividends at all and those that do, while offering very impressive growth rates, still run at valuations that make me extremely uncomfortable (Apple, Microsoft, etc.)
4. Healthcare heavy - I work in this sector and feel very confident on the long term secular growth of the healthcare industry. I've diversified across a variety of subcategories in health as well such as medical device transportation, medical staples (JNJ), biopharma/vaccine, etc.",13,8,Chem3580ThrowAway,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hsv55w/critique_my_dividend_portfolio/,hsv55w

But,  I know there are trials for COVID vaccines happening concurrently. I’m trying to time my purchase (and yes I’m aware that it’s never good to try and time the market, but I’m trying) regarding how I think JNJ would be react to positive/ negative results in the trials and/or worsening COVID stats in the US and globally. 

Does anyone have thoughts on whether a) they’re a good purchase right now and b) how they would react to positive vaccine results or worsening COVID case rates?. I also know JNJ has their own vaccine starting trials next week so I’m trying to weigh that as well.

2020-07-12 15:35:35,r/stocks,Portfolio advice (no ETF available in my country)," Hello, I'm from Argentina. I sold some real state in my country, but financial investments are very limited, and I can´t send my money out of the country. However I can invest in some US listed stocks (they are like ADRs, called CEDEARs). Not trying to ""beat the market"": if I could, I would buy mostly index ETFs and forget about it, but that is not an option unfortunatly. I would be happy if my long term returns are aprox. the same as the SP500.

So, I built a long term portfolio, which I will periodically re-evaluate, buy I will not be following it every week. There is no taxes on capital gains (for now at least), only on dividends. There is a ""target"" allocation, which is difficult to achieve since I am buying full shares, but I will use it as a rule. I already invested aprox 5k, and I will DCA during the following 12 months until 30k aprox. So, this is the portfolio:

MSFT - 7 %

GOOGL - 7 %

AAPL - 7 %

DIS - 7 %

V - 7%

JPM - 7 %

JNJ - 7 %

WMT - 7 %

3M - 7 %

T - 7 %

FB - 4 %

KO - 4 %

MCD - 4 %

BA - 4 %

PFE - 4 %

INTC - 4 %

AMD - 3%

BABA - 3%

What do you think? I was thinking about adding other stocks (PG? HD?), but I think It will unnecesary complicate things. For reference, here is the list of stocks available: [https://www.comafi.com.ar/2254-CEADEAR-SHARES.note.aspx](https://www.comafi.com.ar/2254-CEADEAR-SHARES.note.aspx)

# **Market heads into worst earnings season in 12 years amid worries virus is slowing recovery  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/10/market-heads-into-worst-earnings-season-in-12-years-amid-worries-virus-is-slowing-recovery.html)**
*****
&gt; The worst earnings season in years is about to begin, and it’s possible the stock market could shrug off the sharp profit decline, as long as companies see some signs of a recovery ahead.
*****
&gt; Earnings are expected to fall by 44%, the worst quarterly performance since the Great Recession when S&amp;P 500 profits fell by 67% in the fourth quarter of 2008, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S data. It is also expected to be the worst quarter of the pandemic crisis, revealing the extent of the earnings damage as the economy slumped more than 30%.
*****
&gt; Major financials JPMorgan, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo are among the financial firms reporting. Pepsico starts off the week with its report Monday, and Johnson and Johnson, Abbott Labs and Netflix also report.
*****
&gt; The financial sector is expected to see a more than 52% decline in profits, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; “U.S. companies are about to give us a look into their worst quarter since the Great Financial Crisis,” said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest. “But since so many companies aren’t giving earnings forecasts, investors won’t make moves based on earnings alone. They’ll also be looking at trends since the quarter ended. Increasing coronavirus cases, management outlooks, and price performance could all have an outsized impact, and that could lead to outsized market moves.”
*****
&gt; Stocks turned in a mixed performance in the past week, reacting at times to the rising risks to the economy as coronavirus cases continued to increase in some states. The Dow posted a weekly gain of 0.96% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq were up 1.76% and 4.01%, respectively.
*****
&gt; In the week ahead, there are some important economic reports, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales Thursday. Last month, retail sales rose a surprise 17.7% but this month economists are watching closely to see if the reversal of some openings and the delays in other is impacting consumer spending.
*****
&gt; But it’s the earnings that could be a litmus test for markets.
*****
&gt; “I think it really comes down to earnings, not what the numbers are going to be. People don’t care about the numbers. They want to hear what the companies have to say,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Adivsory Group. “Tech companies are going to have the most important earnings. Companies like semiconductors, that go into automobiles, computers and cell phones. They’re the ones that have to say our outlook is great, and therefore our stocks deserve to be at all-time highs.”
*****
&gt; Tech company earnings are only expected to fall by 8%. The worst sectors are expected to be energy, with a decline of 154%, followed by consumer discretionary, expected to be down by 114%, according to Refinitiv.

# Does a Weak First Six Months Mean Trouble?

&gt; The wild ride of 2020 continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index down 20% in the first quarter and up 20% in the second quarter. Much like dropping a 20 dollar bill and picking it up, this doesn’t mean you are 20 dollars wealthier. Down 20% and then up 20% actually comes out to a 4% drop for the first half of the year.

&gt; What does a negative first half of the year tell us? Turns out, gains could be hard to come by the second half of this year. “Although 2020 is like nothing we’ve seen before, the fact of the matter is a weak first half of the year could mean weaker than normal returns for the rest of the year,” according to LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; In fact, the S&amp;P 500 had been higher in the first six months of the year a record nine consecutive years before being lower in 2020. Since 1950, there were 48 times when the first six months were higher and the rest of the year gained 77% of the time and added 5.8% on average those final six months. Compare that with when the first six months of the year were lower 21 times, the final six months were higher only 52% of the time and up only 1.2% on average.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, a move higher is quite likely after strength in the first six months of the year, while very modest gains could be in the cards if those first six months underwhelm.

# Earnings Season Lurks

&gt; After a relatively quiet week for economic data and practically no earnings reports to speak of, the Q2 earnings season will kick off next week. Normally, earnings season starts quietly with just a handful of reports outside of the major banks, but next week will be relatively busy with some major players on the calendar. Things start off slowly with Pepsi (PEP) on Monday. Tuesday, we’ll get reports from Citigroup (C), Delta (DAL), Fastenal (FAST), JP Morgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC), all of whom are scheduled to report in the morning. Wednesday’s major reports include Goldman (GS), Progressive (PGR), and UnitedHealth (UNH) in the morning, while Alcoa (AA) will report in the afternoon. Thursday will be the busiest day of the week with too many stocks to list here, but Netflix (NFLX) will highlight the schedule of afternoon reports. Finally, Friday’s key reports include Blackrock (BLK) and State Street (STT).

&gt; As far as analyst sentiment stands heading into the current earnings season, while we wouldn't go so far as to say that it has made a full 180-degree turn from last quarter's negative extremes, it has been close. Over the last four weeks, analysts have raised forecasts for 580 companies in the S&amp;P 1500 and lowered forecasts for 419. That works out to a net of 161 or just under 11% of the index. Besides the S&amp;P 1500, six sectors have positive revisions spreads, while just two are negative. Sectors with the most positive revisions spreads include Consumer Staples, Energy, and Technology, while the two sectors with negative spreads are Financials and Real Estate. Financials just can’t find any love these days.

# The ""Miracle"" Nasdaq 100

&gt; For anyone unfamiliar with the 1969 Miracle Mets, the ""Amazins"" were 10 games out of first place as late as mid-August and then went on to win 38 out of their last 49 games to finish in first place over the Cubs. From there, the Mets went on to win the first World Series in the history of the franchise in what at the time was one of the biggest turnarounds in the history of baseball. Ironically, in 2007, the Mets were on the other end of another historic turnaround after they blew a seven-game division lead with less than a month left in the season by losing 12 of their last 17 games. But that collapse is a story for another time.

&gt; Like the Miracle Mets in 1969, the Nasdaq 100 in 2020 has also staged a historic turnaround. After trading up over 10% earlier in the year, the gains quickly evaporated with the COVID outbreak. Within two months, the Nasdaq 100 went from a YTD gain of over 10% to a decline of over 20% by late March. From there, though, the Nasdaq has gone on an epic run, not only erasing all of its losses but also trading to record highs and a gain of over 20% on the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/2020.png))**

&gt; The frequency of positive days for the Nasdaq 100 provides another illustration of the index's strength this year. So far this year, the index has traded higher on 63% of all trading days. That may not sound like much, but if the year were to end today, it would be the highest percentage of positive days for a given year in the Nasdaq 100's history. On a side note, it's interesting to see in this chart how similar the percentage of positive days has been on a year to year basis over time. There has never been a year where fewer than 46% of all trading days have been positive, and prior to 2020, there has never been a year where more than 62% of all trading days were higher.

# China Charges Higher

&gt; We've highlighted the run in Chinese equities quite a lot in the last several days, but it keeps getting more and more extreme. With a gain of over 1% overnight, China's CSI 300 not only turned in its eighth straight day of gains but also its eighth straight day of rallying more than 0.5%. In the history of the CSI 300 dating back to 2002, there has only been one other time where the CSI 300 saw eight or more straight daily gains of 0.5%. That was back in April 2007.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/070920-CSI-300-Streaks.png))**

&gt; If you don't remember what was going on with Chinese equities back in April 2007, take a look at the chart below. The last time the CSI 300 had a streak of 8+ days of 0.5% daily gains, the CSI had already doubled in the prior six months. From there, though, it went on to nearly double again in the next six months. Eventually the bubble burst, and it wasn't much more than a year later that the CSI 300 was back below where it was in April 2007.

# Gold Cup

&gt; The gold ETF (GLD) has gone through a nine-year drought from new all-time highs, but as it gets closer to its prior highs from September 2011, there are three possible upcoming technical set-ups. The first would be a massive multi-year ""cup and handle"" pattern. You can see the ""cup"" that has been forming over the last nine years. For the ""handle"" to form, GLD would need to go into a sideways consolidation phase from here for a bit. Once that consolidation phase occurs, the pattern would suggest a significant leg higher over potentially years (rather than months).

&gt; The second -- and more negative -- setup would be a bearish ""double top."" This would happen if GLD gets right up to its highs from September 2011 and fails to break through that resistance

&gt; Finally, the third setup would simply be a breakout higher from here. GLD could simply continue moving higher and break right through resistance at its 2011 high.

&gt; Regardless of what happens, the ""cup"" that has been forming for nearly a decade now is something you don't see often. It will be interesting to watch this pattern from a technical perspective over the next few months.

However, I want to give a shot at stock picking and seeing if I can outperform the market the next \~5-10 years with some of my picks. Goal is to put a small amount (\~$1K in each) and see where it goes. Any advice, suggestions, or portfolio changes would be greatly appreciated.

Since I'm from Canada, I can't buy partial shares. I'm very interested in investing in Google and am wondering if you guys think it would be crazy to spend $1500 on a share of the company. Google would take up a huge chunk of my portfolio at first but over time I would buy more shares in my other investments to balance things out.

If I don't buy a share of Google I'm thinking that I would probably purchase shares in QQQ due to its fairly large holding of Google. But I'm a bit concerned about how much overlap QQQ has with some of the stocks I'm already invested in. I'm open to any other suggestions

2020-07-04 08:46:14,r/stocks,What are the MSFT's and AAPL's of the Health Care sector? (2-3 year outlook investing advice please!),"I'm looking for a health care company or two to invest in for the next 2-3 years. I'd like to avoid ETF's though.

The problem is that it seems like a lot of companies are way overvalued due to the coronavirus pandemic (i.e. MRNA, NVAX, INO, BIIB to name a few). Not to mention, I don't see their prices being stable at all. One negative report on their covid vaccine progress and their price plummets. I need something more stable with 100% promising outlook for the next 2 years at least. I originally thought JNJ but apparently they haven't been doing so well in the past month or two.

Things I've thought of...

* Mental health care continues to be a growing problem
* Obesity and health problems related to that (diabetes, high blood pressure, etc) also continue to be a growing problem
* Virtual health care, but so far the only company that seems to be publicly traded is TDOC. It seems overvalued though- I haven't done much DD on this
* Ventilator stock? Similar to covid stocks, I'm inclined to assume I ""missed the boat"" but with surges in cases I personally think things are only going to get way worse, I like to think ventilator stocks like RMD could be an incredible pick. However that'd be a short term investment not 2-3yr investment
* General consensus seems to be that Biden is likely to win election. Not sure what this means for health care though. Would this be positive or negative news for health insurance stock UNH?",15,12,Watch1929x,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hkyykn/what_are_the_msfts_and_aapls_of_the_health_care/,hkyykn

I might go with something like JNJ, DIS or MCD.

As a side note: XOM was not a great choice in retrospect (had he bought DHR instead, he would have enjoyed &gt; 20% CAGR (+ dividends) over the past 40 years).",34,12,snake250,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hb5wmg/which_single_dividend_paying_stock_would_you_pick/,hb5wmg
2020-06-16 22:54:37,r/stocks,ETF Advice,"
I am looking to add some ETFs to round out my portfolio and am looking for advice as there are so many options out there and I am trying to sort through all of them. I am going to add 4 ETFs and have already settled on VOO as one of them. For the other 3 I wanted to have two focused on growth and one on dividends. For the dividends one I am choosing between VYM and SCHD but leaning towards SCHD. For the growth ones I am considering SPYG, MGK, and SCHG. But have also been considering VGT and XLK which I believe are focused on technology sector. 

Do any of you more experienced investors have any advice on these ETFs or perhaps some to recommend that I am not considering that I should look at?

These ETFs will make up 50% of my portfolio with the other 50% split up as follows (numbers are rounded so it prob won’t add up to exactly 100)

2020-06-10 19:03:40,r/ValueInvesting,What Sources of Data and Analysis do you use?,"What sites and services do you guys use and how much do they cost?

I used to pretty much only use 10-K/Q's, but I just save so much time by using other peoples analysis to see if a company is worth digging deeper in to. 

Currently the following sources are available to me:

Morningstar - costs $199, but if you don't mind the wonky nerfed version you can probably get it for free from your local library. The Moat ratings, Fair Value, and other proprietary scores and ranks have made their way into my analysis routine. And the portfolio tracker adds up all the holdings within your ETFs and Mutual Funds so you can find out how much AAPL and MSFT and JNJ or whatever you really have exposure to.

Simplysafedividends - $399, but I live off my investment income so dividend safety and income tracking is particularly important to me. Very simple, almost to a fault. This and morningstar are what I rely on the most.

Argus - Comes free through my broker (Vanguard). Limited coverage. There's a couple metrics / ratings in the reports that I've found helpful.

Reality Shares DIVCON - You can check stocks free on their website. It seems to just be a quantitative scoring system. Just another data point to screen by. 

Value Line - I get it for free through my local library. Don't know what if might cost otherwise. Kind of a mess to look at but some of their proprietary ranks/scores appear to be useful. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty much every stock I've analyzed and bought on my own has received an above average rating from these sources, so my personal analysis seems to overlap somewhat. Nowadays since I'm too busy to trawl through a bunch of 10-Ks all day I start with a spreadsheet and the relevant data points from these sources. I use it to look for weak links in my portfolio and stocks that could upgrade to or add without diluting the quality, yield, and growth of the overall portfolio.",7,1,protostones,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/h0f1du/what_sources_of_data_and_analysis_do_you_use/,h0f1du

2020-06-02 02:36:15,r/stocks,Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) Breakdown,"Wanted to change these posts a little in order to incorporate a greater amount of information without it being too overloaded. The post might be a little longer than previous, but gives a better overview of the company imo.

**Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)**

Johnson &amp; Johnson is a multinational healthcare conglomerate that is known for producing pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and healthcare products such as baby care, the skin care product line Neutrogena, and over-the-counter medicines such as Tylenol. Although they've recently been making [headlines](https://www.cancerhealth.com/article/johnson-johnson-ends-north-american-sales-talcbased-baby-powder) for the wrong reasons due to their talc-based baby powder, their massive reach into all major areas of healthcare make them a flagship of the sector and a smart choice for any investor's portfolio.

The company is divided into 3 main segments:

- Consumer Healthcare - baby care, skin &amp; hair care, wound care &amp; topicals, OTC medicines
- Medical Devices - diabetes care &amp; insulin delivery, various surgery related devices, orthopedics
- Pharmaceuticals - drugs for immunology, neuroscience, infectious diseases and oncology 

**JNJ Financials Breakdown**

- Consumer Healthcare - $13.9B = 17% of total sales (+0.3% vs 2018)
- Medical Devices - $26B = 32% of total sales (-3.8% vs 2018)
- Pharmaceuticals - $42.2B = 51% of total sales (+3.6% vs 2018)

Net Sales: $82.1B; $42B U.S. sales, $40B International sales

Research &amp; Development Expenses: $11.3B total, a 5.4% increase over 2018; Consumer Healthcare: $493M, Medical Devices: $2B, Pharmaceuticals: $8.8B

Net Earnings: $15.1B in 2019; $15.3B in 2018

Net Assets: $157.7B with $17.3B in cash &amp; cash equivalents

Liabilities: $98.3B in total liabilities with $26.5B in long term debt

[Data from 2019 10-K](https://johnsonandjohnson.gcs-web.com/static-files/ffd0ad42-ac56-4fd4-8fc2-b033c4ed62c6)

**Other Information**

JNJ is one of only 2 companies rated by S&amp;P as having AAA credit. (Microsoft is the other) [More information on S&amp;P credit ratings can be found here](https://www.standardandpoors.com/en_US/web/guest/article/-/view/sourceId/504352)

JNJ is a dividend king (50+ consecutive years of increasing dividends) with a current streak of 57 years. It is one of only 28 companies to be included on this prestigious list. The stock's current yield is 2.79%. [A good resource on Dividend Kings from one of my favorite sites can be found here](https://www.suredividend.com/dividend-kings/)

JNJ operates in more than 60 countries with 134,000 employees and more than 250 subsidiary companies.

**Analysis**

Johnson &amp; Johnson is one of the largest companies in the world with an impressive portfolio of healthcare products. $40B in international sales and operations in over 60 countries gives them an enormous economic moat and access to markets all over the world. Their sales numbers are solid, and have increased in each of the last 5 years. Earnings dropped slightly compared to 2018 but their R&amp;D expenses increased, indicating they are dedicated to innovation and developing additional new healthcare products. The current pandemic and economic turmoil shouldn't significantly affect their short term financials, and long term they are well positioned for continued success.

Despite their controversies over the years, I think JNJ is a great choice for any investor looking for a long term buy-and-hold healthcare stock. Even after sales in baby care products declined by 10% in 2019, their Consumer Healthcare segment still finished the year with a net increase in sales of 0.3%. While this is due to the massive array of other products they sell, it also highlights how one area of business under-performing doesn't drag the entire company down. The stock isn't a fast mover, but being up 44% over the last 5 years is still respectable growth. With a dividend yield of 2.79% and solid cash flow they have plenty of room to grow their dividend over time as well.",86,1,ZarrCon,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/guwv7u/johnson_johnson_jnj_breakdown/,guwv7u

I’ve still been saving money with the intent of investing it but I just can’t find anything that seems to a be a good value right now. I’m actually pretty interested in picking up some more blue chip stocks (maybe MSFT or JNJ) to balance out the more speculative side of my portfolio but even they seem expensive right now.",8,1,wellidliketotellyou,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/grwa8a/what_do_you_do_when_you_cant_find_anything_to_buy/,grwa8a

&gt;The decision to drop talc-based baby powder came as J&amp;J slims down its lines, in part because of the Covid-19 crisis.

2020-05-12 05:00:22,r/stocks,Why not create my own equal weighted ETF?,"I have a sizeable enough portfolio, I was thinking why not buy my 40-50 favorite stocks I want to hold for the next ten years in relatively equal proportions? 

My candidate list: AAPL ADBE AMD AMZN ATHX BAM BRK.B BRKR COP CRM CSCO CVNA DBX DIS DKNG DOCU EADSY EXAS FB GOOGL HON HPQ IAC INTC ISRG J JNJ JPM LDOS LHX LMT MA MELI MMM MSFT MTCH MU NFLX NOC PINS RTX SE SHOP SNPS SQ STNE TMO TSLA TTD V VTIQ(NKLA) WDAY WMT

So why don't I just buy an ETF, you say? I actually used ETFs in my research to pick many of these stocks.

Obviously there are a lot of ETFs with a lot of these stocks in them, but many are top heavy with some of these, or only have about 20-30% max of what they have of these companies total. I don't want a bunch of other stuff I don't care to buy or haven't researched, although I'm sure some are great companies in their own right. Index ETFs also weight based on market cap and I want more of an equal weighting so the smaller companies' growth can shine. In addition to buying only stocks I actually want to hold, I don't have to pay any expense fees to do so while getting the diversification and risk mitigation an ETF offers. 

What about DCAing? My plan is to split my money added every month between, say, the top 3 best performers last month (because growth leads to more growth), the two worst performers overall (lowering cost basis, but analyzing whether to reassess my position), and the top 5 best ""values"" based upon fundamental analysis -- without allowing any one company to exceed like 4% of cost basis. If any company is getting close to 4% of cost basis I move down the list to the next candidate.

With the Excel stocks feature, it's fairly easy to automate a lot of this to track price changes and tell me what I need to buy more of based on stock movement, so I don't think it will be that hard to manage. I may rotate a few of the positions based on changing conditions where I lose faith in the company's future, but I don't want to be too active managing these and with each taking up a relatively small percentage I don't have to overthink it - just like an ETF holder.

Also, I will put the dividend stocks into my non-taxable Roth and low dividend stocks in my taxable account to minimize the annual tax burden and allow for compounding returns.",20,5,devilmaskrascal,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gi2ptt/why_not_create_my_own_equal_weighted_etf/,gi2ptt
