2025-10-28 22:04:57,r/stocks,Visa Earnings Top Estimates as Consumers Keep Spending on Cards,"&gt;Visa Inc. reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that topped estimates as consumers continued to swipe, tap and insert their credit cards to transact globally.

&gt;Adjusted net income totaled $5.8 billion, or $2.98 a share, up 7% from a year earlier. That slightly exceeded analysts’ estimates of $2.97 a share. Visa said in July that it expected earnings per share to increase by a percentage in the low teens and revenue to grow by low double digits.

&gt;Revenue grew almost 12% to $10.7 billion, also topping estimates. For the full year, Visa expects net revenue to grow by a percentage in the “low-double-digit” range.

&gt;“In our fourth quarter, continued healthy consumer spending drove net revenue up,” Chief Executive Officer Ryan McInerney said in a statement. “As technologies like AI-driven commerce, real-time money movement, tokenization and stablecoins converge to reshape commerce, our focus on innovation and product development positions Visa to lead this transformation.”

&gt;During the period, Visa ended its open-banking operations, which provided technology to help third parties such as financial-technology firms access customer-account data, amid regulatory uncertainty and a changing competitive landscape.

2025-10-22 17:43:34,r/stocks,Walmart pauses H-1B visas for job candidates as Trump hikes fees,"Walmart is pausing the hiring of job candidates who need H-1B visas to work in the U.S., according to a person familiar with the decision, an example of the ways the Trump administration’s immigration policies are shaping corporate strategy.

Walmart’s decision comes after President Donald Trump in September announced higher fees for the visas, which allow companies to temporarily hire skilled workers from other countries such as China and India, often in tech roles. The Trump administration said it would now require companies to pay a $100,000 fee for each new visa application. It said the decision was intended to protect American workers’ jobs and end abuse of the visa.

In a statement, a Walmart spokesperson said, “Walmart is committed to hiring and investing in the best talent to serve our customers while remaining thoughtful about our H-1B hiring approach.”

Exceptions to the pause on H-1B hiring are possible in some cases, said the person familiar with the decision, who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. 

Walmart is the largest U.S. employer with about 1.6 million employees in the country at the end of the most recent fiscal year, and most work in the company’s big-box stores and warehouses. However, H-1B visas are typically used for a small portion of Walmart’s corporate ranks. 

The retail giant’s corporate workforce is based in its headquarters of Bentonville, Arkansas, as well as major U.S. cities like the San Francisco Bay Area.

Walmart had 2,390 employees on H-1B visas, making it the ninth largest U.S. employer to issue the visas, according to U.S. government data as of June 30. Microsoft is No. 1 with 5,189, followed closely by Meta, the parent company of Facebook.

Earlier this month, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging the new H-1B visa fee.

In a news release, the U.S. Chamber’s Chief Policy Officer Neil Bradley said the fee “will make it cost-prohibitive for U.S. employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses, to utilize the H-1B program, which was created by Congress expressly to ensure that American businesses of all sizes can access the global talent they need to grow their operations here in the U.S.”

Walmart’s policy change was first reported by Bloomberg.

China accused the US of violating their recent trade deal and vowed to take measures to defend its interests, dimming the prospect of an immediate leadership call that Donald Trump wants to have to further bilateral talks.

The Chinese Ministry of Commerce issued a statement on Monday rebuking the US president’s claim that Beijing breached the consensus reached in Geneva last month. The dust-up threatened to upend trade relations even as Trump expressed hope Friday he will speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping, with White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett expecting a call to take place this week.

Beijing accused the US of unilaterally introducing new discriminatory restrictions, including new guidelines on AI chip export controls, curbs on chip design software sales to China and the revocation of Chinese student visas.

“If the US insists on its own way and continues to damage China’s interests, China will continue to take resolute and forceful measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” the ministry said. It also said the US violated the consensus reached between Trump and Xi on Jan. 17, when they last spoke, without elaborating.

Asian shares dropped along with US stock-index futures, with a gauge of Chinese stocks traded in Hong Kong falling as much as 2.9%, the most in nearly two months.

Tensions between the world’s largest economies are ratcheting up again after the tariff thaw in May. The Trump administration last week said it planned to start revoking visas for Chinese students while moving to restrict the sale of chip design software to China. They have also barred the export of critical US jet engine parts and technology to China, the New York Times reported.

Beyond strains in economic ties, geopolitical friction is also growing. China’s Foreign Ministry over the weekend protested US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s assertion at a gathering of military chiefs that China poses an imminent threat to Taiwan, a self-ruled island claimed by Beijing.

Trump didn’t elaborate when he accused Beijing of violating the tariff truce on Friday, but US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer complained that China had not sped exports of critical minerals needed for cutting-edge electronics.

China has been loosening the grip on its exports of rare earths over the past week at a pace that’s “slower than industry would like,” said Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.

In the statement, the Commerce Ministry said it “resolutely rejects” the US accusations and that the country has strictly and sincerely implemented the consensus.

Trump’s comments came a day after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said talks with China on trade had stalled and suggested that a call between Trump and Xi might be necessary to break the deadlock.

The US president “is going to have a wonderful conversation about the trade negotiations this week with President Xi,” Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, said Sunday on ABC’s This Week. “That’s our expectation.”

Trump has signaled a wish to have a call with his Chinese counterpart as early as February and later said he was willing to travel to the Asian nation to meet with Xi, although no such engagement has been scheduled so far.",2021,121,callsonreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1l1ehpt/china_accuses_us_of_violating_trade_deal_vows/,1l1ehpt
2025-05-23 12:24:31,r/stocks,This Little-Known Company’s Network Effect Might Rival Visa’s,"*Summary*
SPS Commerce isn’t a name you’ll see on billboards, but in the world of retail supply chains, they’re everywhere. They help stores and brands exchange the essential documents that keep products flowing—things like purchase orders, invoices, and shipping updates—without relying on emails, spreadsheets, or outdated manual processes. That may sound mundane, but the business model is anything but.

Once a company connects to SPS, they’re unlikely to leave. And new customers often find it’s the only practical option if they want to work with big-name retailers. That’s a classic network effect—and it’s what makes SPS surprisingly hard to replace.

*What They Actually Do*
SPS runs a cloud-based platform that lets retailers, suppliers, distributors, and warehouses talk to each other in a structured, automated way. The tech behind it is called EDI (Electronic Data Interchange), which is a standard for sending business documents digitally.

Think of it like a universal translator for the supply chain. Instead of everyone building custom connections to one another, they plug into SPS, and SPS handles the formatting, rules, and compliance.

*Some of Their Top Customers*
SPS doesn’t always name every client publicly, but through press releases, case studies, and partner integrations, we know they work with:

•	Walmart

•	Target

•	Costco

•	Amazon (3rd-party seller connections)

•	Best Buy

•	Nordstrom

•	Dollar General

•	The Home Depot (via supplier network)

They also support thousands of mid-size and smaller businesses who supply these retailers. In many cases, the retailer will require their suppliers to use SPS to stay compliant with order and shipping processes.

In other words: if you want shelf space with a major retailer, chances are you’re using SPS—or you’re losing time and money trying not to.

*Why Customers Stay*

1.	Switching is expensive and messy
Once a company is hooked into SPS, changing systems would mean rebuilding how they connect with every partner they trade with. That’s a major project with lots of risk.

2.	Retailers push vendors toward SPS
If you’re a supplier and your big-box customer wants you to use SPS, saying no usually isn’t an option.

3.	It just works

Most clients aren’t looking to reinvent how they send invoices or confirm shipments. They just want it to happen automatically in the background. SPS delivers that.

*Why New Customers Choose SPS*

•	Everyone’s already using it: Joining the SPS network means you can plug into hundreds or thousands of trading partners with minimal setup.

•	Built-in compliance: SPS already knows what data format Walmart or Target wants. Trying to manage that yourself is asking for chargebacks or canceled orders.

•	Reputation: They’ve been doing this for over 20 years. That kind of trust takes time to earn, and competitors can’t copy it overnight.

Revenue That Sticks
SPS makes money from subscriptions and usage-based fees. Customers pay for the number of partners they connect with and the volume of documents they send. As their business grows, so does the amount they pay SPS.

Retention is high:

•	Gross retention: ~97% (clients don’t leave)

•	Net retention: 110%+ (existing clients spend more over time)

This is a system that grows with the customer, not one that needs constant reselling.

*Practical Risks*

No business is risk-free. Here are a few real concerns to keep in mind:

1.	EDI could become less relevant
If large players like Amazon push for entirely new communication standards (e.g., API-first integrations), SPS could fall behind if it’s too locked into legacy systems.

2.	Big customers have bargaining power
If a major retailer (like Walmart) decides to switch to or build its own system, SPS could lose a large chunk of volume and credibility fast.

3.	Security and downtime
Since SPS is embedded into critical supply chain operations, any outage, hack, or system failure could have major consequences—and cost them clients.

4.	Competition from modern platforms
Younger SaaS platforms with better user interfaces and developer tools may chip away at the edges, especially with startups and smaller suppliers.

5.	Slow international growth
SPS is dominant in North America, but less so globally. If competitors scale internationally faster, SPS may miss out on the next wave of supply chain tech growth.

*Final Take*

SPS Commerce is a quiet workhorse of the retail world. It doesn’t have the buzz of an AI company or the excitement of a consumer brand. But it does something arguably more valuable: it builds infrastructure that’s hard to leave.

And like Visa, the more people plug in, the more powerful the network becomes.

2025-05-15 18:53:00,r/stocks,Turning Water into Wealth - $LB Landbridge Analysis,"In the past, turning water into wine was considered a biblical miracle. However, with the rise of AI, anyone can now do this incredible feat by investing in Landbridge.

Landbridge is a company that owns land, focusing on the Delaware sub-basin within the Permian Basin. For those unaware, this region is known for having the most active oil and natural gas exploration in the US. If this sounds familiar, its business model and area of activity is similar to the highly successful Teas Pacific ($TPL). However, a massive difference between TPL and LB is LB primarily relies on water royalties for their revenues.

Let's break down their most recent 1Q25 Earnings: [https://s204.q4cdn.com/780627658/files/doc\_presentation/2025/LandBridge-Q1-25-Earnings-Deck\_vF.pdf](https://s204.q4cdn.com/780627658/files/doc_presentation/2025/LandBridge-Q1-25-Earnings-Deck_vF.pdf)

Revenue came in at $44M, up 131% YoY. 59% came from royalties of land usage. 33% Came from royalties of sales of water/products obtained from land. Only 8% came from royalties from actual Oil &amp; Gas Production. The bulk of these revenues are due to the water needs of high power data centers. As companies continue to develop $10B+ data centers, the access of water is what enables the usage of these centers, creating a continuous revenue opportunity for LB.

The key takeaway is Landbridge does not take on any production/capex risk- it is simply a landowner that allows other companies to operate their production on their assets. This makes it an extremely high margin business, making Visa/Nvidia look inefficient.

The company boasts ""adjusted EBITDA"" margins of 88%. That being said, current GAAP net margins are at 35%, a far cry from the expected 90% management alludes to. This is due to SBC and Interest Expense  due to debt issued to fuel land acquisition. In addition, quarterly FCF is down 40% YoY from $27M to $16M. This is due to a temporary increase in accounts receivable that will be normalized as revenue is recognized.

I personally believe that this is palatable for the moment. There is only so much prime attractive land and I would rather LB acquire it now to generate incredible cash flow in the future. For example, the most recent purchase of Bone Ranch for $245M. This led to a 70% QoQ increase in water royalty volumes and will bring in a MINIMUM of $25M per year for the next 5 years. Again, this is all revenue with essentially 90% margins. These are accretive purchases that will payoff tenfold in the coming years.

As Landbridge continues to engage in accretive M&amp;A to accelerate high margin revenue, the thesis continues to strengthen alongside the growth of water intensive data centers.",12,7,thelastsubject123,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1knd5wb/turning_water_into_wealth_lb_landbridge_analysis/,1knd5wb
2025-05-14 05:53:04,r/stocks,Fintech company Chime files for IPO,"Financial technology company Chime on Tuesday filed paperwork to go public on the Nasdaq. The company intends to file under the ticker symbol “CHYM.”

“Chime is a technology company, not a bank,” the company said in its prospectus, noting it is not a member of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Still, the company cited Bank of America, Capital One, Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank and Wells Fargo as competitors.

According to the filing, Chime picks up revenue from interchange fees associated with purchases that members make with Chime debit cards and credit cards. Banks collect interchange fees, which are generally a percentage of the transaction value, plus a set amount for each transaction depending on the rates determined by card networks such as Visa. The banks then pass money on to Chime.

In the March quarter, Chime generated $12.9 million in net income on $518.7 million in revenue. Revenue grew 32%, while profit narrowed from $15.9 million.

At the end of March, Chime had 8.6 million active members, up about 23% year over year. Average revenue per active member, at $251, was up from $231. It has members in all 50 states — it doesn’t operate outside the U.S. — and 55% of them are female. The average member age is 36, according to Chime.

The United States is witnessing a sharp decline in international student enrollment due to stricter immigration policies, rising visa refusals, and potential elimination of the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program. These changes are discouraging students, particularly from India—the largest source of foreign students in the U.S.—from applying, with a 38% drop in Indian visa issuances in 2024 alone. This downturn threatens significant financial losses for universities that rely heavily on full-tuition-paying international students, who contribute over $43 billion annually to the U.S. economy.

2025-04-28 14:47:42,r/stocks,"Stock futures drift lower as traders await Big Tech earnings, progress on trade deals","Stock futures fell Monday ahead of a packed week for earnings and economic data. Wall Street is also awaiting any progress on trade deal negotiations.

S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures each declined 0.2%, while futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 56 points, or 0.1%.

On Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent offered little clarity on the direction of reaching a possible trade agreement with China, but said that the onus was not on the United States.

""I believe that it's up to China to de-escalate, because they sell five times more to us than we sell to them, and so these 120%, 145% tariffs are unsustainable,"" Bessent said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

His comments come after President Donald Trump said last week that discussions with China were underway, refuting China's claims of no trade talks between the two countries.

On the positive side, however, Bessent said that they were making progress on other trade proposals, suggesting one with India would be ""one of the first"" to come. South Korea also hinted last week that trade talks were underway.

Investors are looking ahead to the busiest period of the first-quarter earnings season, which will see more than 180 S&amp;P 500 companies report results. Four of the 'Magnificent Seven' companies— Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms and Microsoft — will release their quarterly reports, as will financial, staples and health care stocks Visa, Coca-Cola, and Eli Lilly.

Earnings results have been somewhat strong for the prior quarter, with 73% of companies reporting beating analysts' estimates so far — slightly below the 5-year average of 77%, according to FactSet data. Still, Wall Street is lowering expectations for the second quarter and the full year as companies come out with uncertain guidance because of President Donald Trump's tariffs.

This week will mark the end of April, which has seen stocks whipsaw across a wide trading range after Trump unveiled his sweeping tariff plans and then later walked some of the stiffer duties back.

So far in April, the S&amp;P 500 is down by 1.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is on track to lose 4.5% and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.5%. The S&amp;P 500 briefly entered a bear market on April 7 and has made a recovery since, but the index has failed to break through key resistance levels.

""While it may be too early to make the technical case for a bottom in beta underperformance, the recent rebound off key support implies investors should remain on high alert for a potential shift back toward risk-on leadership,"" Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, said.

The week also will see multiple reports on the labor market as well as key data on inflation and economic growth. Topping the list will be Friday's nonfarm payrolls release, while first-quarter gross domestic product and the Fed's preferred inflation gauge will be out Wednesday.

2025-04-02 06:32:37,r/stocks,"US tourism officials sound alarm, tourist flights to US sink 70% and could impact up to 140k hospitality jobs and $14B in economic spending","Here is my way of trying to find alpha in an erratic stock market - how I'm trading the US tourism dip.

**1. Canada is the US's largest source of tourism**: In 2024, 20 million Canadian tourists visited the US, spent $20.5 billion, and supported 140,000 US jobs. Canada's population is 40 million, so 50% of the entire country visited, and the US had 77 million tourists so 1 country is contributing 26% of visits.

**2. Recent US policies is leading to a tourism boycott from Canadians, and the rest of the world**: Tourists are boycotting US tourism due to tariffs, annexation threats, new travel barriers, and stories of visitors being unlawfully detained with no due process (in March a Canadian citizen was denied entry due to an expired visa, while this was a worker and not a tourist, instead of being allowed to return to Canada, as is the norm, she was shackled in chains and sent to a private ICE facility for 2 weeks without being able to contact a lawyer or get a bed).

**3. Analysts previously predicted policies would decrease tourism by 5%, new numbers released this week show that it's 14x higher:** For Canada alone (26% of US's entire tourism industry with 20 million visitors) - airline travel is **down** **70%**, land travel is **down** **45%**, and **85%+** of tourists survey say they cancelled their US trips.

**4. Here's how I'm planning on using this information to make stock trades into specific companies both long and short:** I'm shorting airlines that have high exposure to Can-US routes (it's been reported that airlines are slashing these routes due to 0 demand, and they is no clear way they can cover this revenue gap with a lower utilized fleet). I'm shorting select hospitality chains (hotels, restaurants) with high exposure/retail foot print in US states that border Canada like Niagara Falls. The US travel association says that even just a 10% dip in tourists will lead to $2 billion in economic losses and 140,000 jobs at risk (assuming 70% decrease from air travel happens across the board, that's $14b), I expect hospitality to have lower revenues. I'm shorting all non-essential or higher price retailers with a big footprint in hostility states, all these workers being laid off by lack of tourism + the gov worker job cuts won't have as much to spend (not my specific trade, but an example would be short Target, long Dollar General).

I'm long, and buying, non-American/Europe hotel chains and travel booking platforms that get most of their revenue outside the US, as I expect Canadian and international tourists to concentrate their spend to Europe/Asia/Oceania travel this summer.

**Edit 5. How do the European/International figures play?**

It's important to note that the Canadian tourism numbers dipped after the policies that happened in point 2. And we're seeing what those numbers are a few months later now. The US admin is rolling out these policies across the board tomorrow during ""Liberation Day"". The point here is that we won't see the true vector of an internal tourism boycott both in terms of magnitude and direction until the policies that were enacted on Canada are enacted globally, and consumers have time to adjust behaviour. But if the Canadian consumer is any indication, I have more conviction in my trades. **A glimpse into this being a trend is a French travel company reporting to Bloomberg their Europe to US travel bookings are down 25%.**

**Edit 6. Example of the airline play**

Yes I know US airlines are already down a lot. Rode that wave and exited my shorts. Now I'm shorting Air Canada and ONEX (parent company of WestJet), since they have much more exposure to US-Can routes, and are cutting routes dramatically with no increase in capacity elsewhere

Also looking to short airline maitence companies, the food suppliers specific to flight food, and fuel refineries/storage those two airlines use, and retail stores with large exposure to airports that only see US/Canada travel.

But going long on regional air craft hangers since their smaller fleets are used the most for US/Canada travel, while their bigger fleets will still be active for the europe/asia flight routes that havn't seen impact on demand.

Would like to hear what everyone thinks about this trade play. Thanks!

2025-02-26 23:49:11,r/stocks,Wrote this about the US economy...,"Anyone who saw the latest poll on consumer confidence should know one thing: The American people are scared.

A friend of mine said: “If the American people can suffer some short-term pain, the DJT will go down as the greatest President has ever had”.

To invoke a line from Speed: “Pop Quiz, Hot-Shot…When have you ever known the US population to be willing to take some short-term pain in the last 60 years?”

For me, I don’t think they’ve been willing to do that since World War II, and that’s saying something.

So when the Consumer Confidence Index — a key measurement of how people are feeling about their pockets (basically) — falls to 98.3 and down 7% since last month.

People are fearing a bloodbath. For their homes. For their wallets. For their futures.

“Of the five components of the Index, only consumers’ assessment of present business conditions improved, albeit slightly. Views of current labor market conditions weakened. Consumers became pessimistic about future business conditions and less optimistic about future income. Pessimism about future employment prospects worsened and reached a ten-month high,” Stephanie Guichard, senior member of the Conference that issued the statement.

The labor market conditions wouldn’t be too bad if people were willing to get off their butts and replace all the undocumented workers who have been piled off back to their homes in the back of an armored truck and work in construction or farming, but people aren’t willing to do that.

Of course Johnny American is worried about future income. All companies seem to be doing is firing, firing, firing, firing and more firing, because they want to be please their beloved shareholders.

And the 401Ks — a way of almost guaranteeing their future happiness — are getting eroded while their credit card debts [are flying upwards](https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc).

Simply telling people to throw in some beans and hope they’ll come out magic soon is quite simply a bad idea.

Food prices are expected to rise again in 2025, and the price of eggs — something that’s given a lot of headlines and used by the Democrats as a way of thumping Donnie but isn’t actually his or ANYONE’S fault — continues its exponential rise ($8-a-dozen, and you can’t kill off all the chickens in America).

One of the biggest employers in America — the construction industry (8 million workers — is on its knees at the moment. Among what is happening is that housing companies are blaming labour costs. That’s because of the difference between how many jobs have been lost thanks to Homeland Security, and how many visas have been produced. Combined with the fact that people are scared for their future, it’s a perfect storm.

The other reason is why people are scared — and you’ve guessed it — is AI. A [very recent poll](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2025/02/25/u-s-workers-are-more-worried-than-hopeful-about-future-ai-use-in-the-workplace/) by Pew Research said that 52% of US workers are scared crapless about computers taking their jobs. The techbros who try and tell you that there will be loads of jobs around the AI space are actually lying, it seems. 6% of the current workforce thinks that AI will create more job opportunities for them in the long-run, and 32% said that it will make for less. And the middle bit are lying to themselves.

And worse — the guys at the top have done absolutely nothing to reassure them. I’m sorry, but blasting out a few tweets isn’t going to help the American people in their immediate problems.

The current administration needs to work out how to get people happier about their current situations now, before it gets worse.

2025-02-20 10:14:05,r/stocks,'Stagflation' fears haunt US markets despite Trump's pro-growth agenda,"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/stagflation-fears-haunt-us-markets-despite-trumps-pro-growth-agenda-2025-02-20/

Feb 20 (Reuters) - Stubborn inflation and President Donald Trump's hard-line trade policies have rekindled fears of stagflation, a worrying mix of sluggish growth and relentless inflation that haunted the U.S. in the 1970s, even as markets remain upbeat on his pro-growth agenda.

The potential return of stagflation, which would pressure a range of assets, has been flagged periodically over the past 50 years but not materialized as a real threat to investor portfolios. While economists and portfolio managers are not ready to say that this time is different, the dreaded scenario has crept back as a key risk for investors in recent weeks, as the prospect of trade wars and punitive tariffs cast a shadow over U.S. growth.

""Stagflation has definitely re-emerged as a possibility because we have these policies that could hurt consumer demand even while persistent inflation limits the Federal Reserve's ability to maneuver,"" said Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager for Brandywine Global's fixed income strategies. ""It's not a zero-possibility scenario any more, by a long shot.""

A key piece of the stagflation puzzle - inflation that refuses to cool down - lodged more firmly into place earlier this month, when government data showed consumer prices rose in January at their fastest monthly pace since August 2023, bringing the annual rate of inflation to 3%.

The other piece of the puzzle, U.S. economic growth, hangs in the balance, with Trump's tariffs threatening to add inflationary pressure that could tip the scale.

""What continues to concern us more than the risk of inflation is stagflation,"" said Tim Urbanowicz, chief investment strategist at Innovator Capital Management. ""There is that sticky base of inflation to contend with but on top of that, tariffs have the potential to slow down the economy by becoming a tax on consumers and weighing on profits and economic growth.""

A Bank of America survey of global fund managers on Tuesday showed the proportion of investors expecting stagflation - defined by the bank as below-trend growth and above-trend inflation - over the next year stood at a seven-month high. At the same time, investors remained bullish on stocks, with a trade war seen as a low-probability risk, the survey showed.

While Trump postponed imposing new tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico for a month at the beginning of February, he has rolled out a new 10% levy on all Chinese imports and announced tariffs on global steel and aluminum imports.

He has also tasked his economics team with devising plans for reciprocal tariffs on every country that taxes U.S. imports, and this week said he plans to introduce 25% tariffs on autos, semiconductors and pharmaceutical imports.

Some investors believe any hit to growth from tariffs would be temporary.
Over a longer-term horizon, tariffs could even promote growth, said Maddi Dessner, head of asset class services at Capital Group, boosting industries that will benefit from less competition globally. On the other hand, their initial impact could increase price pressures.

""The truth is it's probably going to be somewhere in between those two things,"" she said, adding tariffs were partly why Capital Group now forecasts 10-year Treasury yields at 3.9% over a 20-year horizon, up from a 3.7% forecast last year.

'NOT THERE YET'

Stagflation emerged as a source of anxiety as recently as 2022, when inflation rates spiked and stock and bond prices plummeted, but that scenario did not materialize as inflation eventually eased and growth remained resilient.
Many believe that the U.S. economy will once again steer clear of stagflation.
So-called core inflation at about 3% remains well below the levels hit in the 1970s, when the annual rate of core inflation averaged about 7%. This time around inflation expectations remain ""anchored"", meaning the long-term inflation picture is not fluctuating wildly with each fresh piece of economic data, said Evercore ISI in a recent note.

Still, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, warned the market may be underestimating stagflation risks. The prospect of large-scale deportations of workers without visas or other work documents, another Trump campaign pledge, also would fuel inflation, he noted.
""Tariffs and deportations are a recipe for inflation and hurt growth; both are negative supply shocks,"" he said, adding that negative supply shocks such as a crude oil price surge contributed to 1970s stagflation.

2025-02-20 10:11:16,r/stocks,'Stagflation' fears haunt US markets despite Trump's pro-growth agenda,"Feb 20 (Reuters) - Stubborn inflation and President Donald Trump's hard-line trade policies have rekindled fears of stagflation, a worrying mix of sluggish growth and relentless inflation that haunted the U.S. in the 1970s, even as markets remain upbeat on his pro-growth agenda.

The potential return of stagflation, which would pressure a range of assets, has been flagged periodically over the past 50 years but not materialized as a real threat to investor portfolios. While economists and portfolio managers are not ready to say that this time is different, the dreaded scenario has crept back as a key risk for investors in recent weeks, as the prospect of trade wars and punitive tariffs cast a shadow over U.S. growth.

""Stagflation has definitely re-emerged as a possibility because we have these policies that could hurt consumer demand even while persistent inflation limits the Federal Reserve's ability to maneuver,"" said Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager for Brandywine Global's fixed income strategies. ""It's not a zero-possibility scenario any more, by a long shot.""

A key piece of the stagflation puzzle - inflation that refuses to cool down - lodged more firmly into place earlier this month, when government data showed consumer prices rose in January at their fastest monthly pace since August 2023, bringing the annual rate of inflation to 3%.

The other piece of the puzzle, U.S. economic growth, hangs in the balance, with Trump's tariffs threatening to add inflationary pressure that could tip the scale.

""What continues to concern us more than the risk of inflation is stagflation,"" said Tim Urbanowicz, chief investment strategist at Innovator Capital Management. ""There is that sticky base of inflation to contend with but on top of that, tariffs have the potential to slow down the economy by becoming a tax on consumers and weighing on profits and economic growth.""

A Bank of America survey of global fund managers on Tuesday showed the proportion of investors expecting stagflation - defined by the bank as below-trend growth and above-trend inflation - over the next year stood at a seven-month high. At the same time, investors remained bullish on stocks, with a trade war seen as a low-probability risk, the survey showed.

While Trump postponed imposing new tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico for a month at the beginning of February, he has rolled out a new 10% levy on all Chinese imports and announced tariffs on global steel and aluminum imports.

He has also tasked his economics team with devising plans for reciprocal tariffs on every country that taxes U.S. imports, and this week said he plans to introduce 25% tariffs on autos, semiconductors and pharmaceutical imports.

Some investors believe any hit to growth from tariffs would be temporary.
Over a longer-term horizon, tariffs could even promote growth, said Maddi Dessner, head of asset class services at Capital Group, boosting industries that will benefit from less competition globally. On the other hand, their initial impact could increase price pressures.

""The truth is it's probably going to be somewhere in between those two things,"" she said, adding tariffs were partly why Capital Group now forecasts 10-year Treasury yields at 3.9% over a 20-year horizon, up from a 3.7% forecast last year.

'NOT THERE YET'

Stagflation emerged as a source of anxiety as recently as 2022, when inflation rates spiked and stock and bond prices plummeted, but that scenario did not materialize as inflation eventually eased and growth remained resilient.
Many believe that the U.S. economy will once again steer clear of stagflation.
So-called core inflation at about 3% remains well below the levels hit in the 1970s, when the annual rate of core inflation averaged about 7%. This time around inflation expectations remain ""anchored"", meaning the long-term inflation picture is not fluctuating wildly with each fresh piece of economic data, said Evercore ISI in a recent note.

Still, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, warned the market may be underestimating stagflation risks. The prospect of large-scale deportations of workers without visas or other work documents, another Trump campaign pledge, also would fuel inflation, he noted.
""Tariffs and deportations are a recipe for inflation and hurt growth; both are negative supply shocks,"" he said, adding that negative supply shocks such as a crude oil price surge contributed to 1970s stagflation.

Guneet Dhingra, head of US rates strategy at BNP Paribas, said the market has been ""complacent"" over the past six months, focusing on Trump's pro-growth policies. He said stagflation-wary investors could sell two-year Treasuries, likely to lose value due to higher inflation, and buy 10-year Treasuries that would benefit in a low-growth scenario.

2025-01-30 20:47:53,r/stocks,PayPal (PYPL): A Fintech Giant at an Inflection Point,"Overview of PayPal’s Market Position

PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL) remains a dominant force in the digital payments ecosystem. With over 400 million active users and deep integrations across major e-commerce platforms, PayPal has established itself as a key player in the financial technology sector. Despite this, its stock has faced headwinds, leading to a valuation that many analysts believe is undervalued relative to its historical trading range and fintech peers.

As of January 30, 2025, PayPal is trading at $90.08, reflecting a 1.49% increase from the previous close. From both a technical and fundamental perspective, the stock presents an intriguing case for potential investors.

Technical Analysis: Bullish Momentum Emerging

Key Moving Averages

20-Day SMA: $87.93 ✅ (Stock price above – bullish)

50-Day SMA: $87.71 ✅ (Stock price above – bullish)

100-Day SMA: $82.83 ✅ (Stock price above – strong momentum)

200-Day SMA: $73.23 ✅ (Stock price above – long-term bullish trend)


PayPal’s current price exceeding all major moving averages indicates a strong bullish trend, suggesting continued upside potential.

Key Technical Indicators

Relative Strength Index (RSI): 50.04 → Neutral, not overbought or oversold

MACD: 0.66 → Bearish signal, but improving trend

ADX: 15.29 → Buy signal, trend strengthening

CCI: 16.37 → Neutral


The RSI and CCI suggest that PayPal is in a neutral zone, meaning there is room for further price appreciation. The MACD remains slightly bearish but shows signs of improvement, while the ADX indicates a strengthening trend.

Support &amp; Resistance Levels

Resistance:

R1: $91.22

R2: $92.21

R3: $94.12


Support:

S1: $88.32

S2: $86.41

S3: $85.42


Breaking through $91.22 could signal further upside, while strong support levels suggest downside protection in the mid-$80s.

Fundamental Strengths: A Long-Term Growth Story

1. Strong Cash Flow &amp; Profitability

Unlike many high-growth fintech companies, PayPal remains cash-flow positive and profitable, enabling the company to invest in new initiatives, potential acquisitions, and stock buybacks.

2. AI-Driven Innovations &amp; Fraud Prevention

PayPal is leveraging AI-driven fraud detection and personalized financial services, which not only improve security but also enhance customer retention and merchant adoption.

3. Venmo &amp; Expanding Partnerships

Venmo’s expansion into business payments, tipping, and crypto transactions continues to drive new revenue streams. Additionally, PayPal maintains strong partnerships with Amazon, Uber, and major retailers, reinforcing its dominance in the digital payments space.

4. Crypto &amp; Web3 Integration

PayPal has embraced cryptocurrency and blockchain, introducing PayPal USD (PYUSD) and expanding its role in crypto payments. This strategic move positions PayPal as an early leader in Web3 finance.

5. Valuation &amp; Analyst Sentiment

67% of analysts rate PYPL as a Buy

Lower P/E ratio compared to fintech peers like Block (SQ) and Visa (V)

Stock trading significantly below historical highs, suggesting potential for revaluation


Conclusion: Is PayPal a Buy?

From a technical standpoint, PayPal appears to be building momentum, trading above key moving averages while maintaining strong support levels. A breakout above $91.22 could confirm further upside potential.

From a fundamental perspective, PayPal’s strong cash flow, AI-driven innovations, crypto adoption, and growing Venmo ecosystem position it for long-term success. Given its current valuation relative to competitors, the stock may present an attractive opportunity for investors with a mid-to-long-term horizon.

Investment Consideration:

✅ Bullish technical setup
✅ Resilient business model &amp; strong cash flow
✅ Undervalued compared to peers
⚠️ MACD suggests caution in the short term
⚠️ Broader market conditions may impact fintech sentiment

Investors should watch for a break above $91.22, as well as any news on future stock buybacks, earnings growth, or additional fintech partnerships.

2025-01-15 13:10:50,r/stocks,China Weighs Sale of TikTok US to Musk as a Possible Option,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese officials are evaluating a potential option that involves Elon Musk acquiring the US operations of TikTok if the company fails to fend off a controversial ban on the short-video app, according to people familiar with the matter.

Beijing officials strongly prefer that TikTok remains under the ownership of parent ByteDance Ltd., the people say, and the company is contesting the impending ban with an appeal to the US Supreme Court. But the justices signaled during arguments on Jan. 10 that they are likely to uphold the law. Senior Chinese officials had already begun to debate contingency plans for TikTok as part of an expansive discussion on how to work with Donald Trump’s administration, one of which involves Musk, said the people, asking not to be identified revealing confidential discussions.

A potential high-profile deal with one of Trump’s closest allies holds some appeal for the Chinese government, which is expected to have some say over whether TikTok is ultimately sold, said the people. Musk spent more than $250 million supporting Trump’s re-election, and has been tapped for a prominent role in improving government efficiency after the Republican takes office.

Under one scenario that’s been discussed by the Chinese government, Musk’s X — the former Twitter — would take control of TikTok US and run the businesses together, the people said. With more than 170 million users in the US, TikTok could bolster X’s efforts to attract advertisers. Musk also founded a separate artificial intelligence company, xAI, that could benefit from the huge amounts of data generated from TikTok.

Follow The Big Take daily podcast wherever you listen.

Chinese officials have yet to reach any firm consensus about how to proceed and their deliberations are still preliminary, the people said. It’s not clear how much ByteDance knows about the Chinese government discussions or whether TikTok and Musk have been involved. It’s also unclear whether Musk, TikTok and ByteDance have held any talks about the terms of any possible deal.

Musk and his representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Musk posted in April that he thinks TikTok should remain available in the US. “In my opinion, TikTok should not be banned in the USA, even though such a ban may benefit the X platform,” he wrote on X. “Doing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. It is not what America stands for.”

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun declined to comment on the story during a regular press briefing Tuesday, referring reporters to Beijing’s previous statements on the matter. The country’s government had earlier denounced US attempts to ban TikTok and force a sale, calling them “economic bullying” and “plundering.”

The Cyberspace Administration of China and China’s Ministry of Commerce, government agencies that could be involved in decisions about TikTok’s future, didn’t respond to requests for comment. “We can’t be expected to comment on pure fiction,” a ByteDance representative said.

The talks in Beijing suggest that TikTok’s fate may no longer be in ByteDance’s sole control, said the people. Chinese officials recognize they will face tough negotiations with the Trump administration over tariffs, export controls and other issues, and they see the TikTok negotiations as a potential area for reconciliation, they said.

The Chinese government holds a so-called golden share in a ByteDance affiliate that gives it influence over the company’s strategy and operations. TikTok maintains that the control only applies to the China-based subsidiary Douyin Information Service Co., and has no bearing on ByteDance operations outside China. Still, Beijing’s export rules prevent Chinese companies from selling their software algorithms, like the one integral to TikTok. Because the Chinese government would have to approve of a sale that includes TikTok’s valuable recommendation engine, it has a significant voice in any possible deal.

TikTok’s US operations could be valued at around $40 billion to $50 billion, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Damian Reimertz estimated last year. That’s a substantial sum even for the world’s richest person. It’s not clear how Musk could pull off such a transaction, whether it would require the sale of other holdings, or whether the US government would approve. He paid $44 billion for Twitter in 2022, and is still paying off sizable loans.

Musk has a positive reputation among many ByteDance employees in China, according to a person familiar with the matter. He is seen as a very successful entrepreneur, who has experience engaging with the Chinese government through his Tesla Inc. business, the person added.

ByteDance’s leaders have repeatedly said their priority is to fight US legislation that requires the Beijing-based company sell or shut down the US operations because of national security concerns. TikTok’s lawyers have argued the legislation violates free speech laws under the Constitution’s First Amendment.

A majority of the Supreme Court justices suggested the security concerns take priority over free speech, although they have yet to issue a formal decision. President-elect Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, has sought to delay the TikTok ban — which takes effect Jan. 19 — so he can work on the negotiations. He has said he wants to “save” the app and there’s been speculation he could take last-minute action to sidestep the ban.

On a practical level, spinning off TikTok’s US business would be highly complex, affecting shareholders in China as well as the US. Lawyers for TikTok argued before the Supreme Court that separating the US portions of the product would be “extraordinarily difficult.”

It’s unclear if US TikTok would be sold off in a competitive process, or if a sale would be arranged by the government. Billionaire Frank McCourt and “Shark Tank” investor Kevin O’Leary are part of a bid through Project Liberty to acquire TikTok, which O’Leary has said he discussed with Trump. In the past, Microsoft Corp. had sought to acquire the business, and Oracle Corp. has a deep technology partnership with the company.

One alternative for TikTok would be to move its existing US customers over to a similar app — with different branding — to potentially sidestep the ban, one of the people said. It’s not clear how effective such a move would be.

One person close to the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the strategy, said before the Supreme Court hearing that the legal battle is still the focus of top executives and they would prefer to keep fighting in the US rather than sell TikTok US and cede control for good.

Musk is in a position to influence the China-US relationship as the world’s richest person with businesses that straddle the world’s two largest economies. Tesla, where Musk is chief executive officer, erected a sprawling factory in Shanghai in 2019 and has since expanded the facility into the company’s largest production base. The effort helped Tesla expand its market share in China despite tough local competition, and build goodwill with government officials.

While Trump is staffing his incoming administration with China hawks like Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio, Musk has spoken out against some recent China trade policies, including the Biden administration’s tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles.

The sale of TikTok to Musk could raise anew questions about whether the billionaire is leveraging his relationship with Trump to further his business interests. Democrats and government watchdogs have already expressed concern that Musk could seek to roll back regulations on and investigations into Tesla’s autonomous driving system, and head off probes into labor practices at his companies. Musk firms hold billions of dollars in government contracts, and allies have suggested that the incoming administration could seek to expand government subsidies or contracts for SpaceX and its Starlink satellite network. Musk has also faced repeated investigations by the Securities and Exchange Committee.

Few expect that scrutiny to continue given the close relationship Musk has cultivated with Trump throughout the campaign and transition. Since Trump’s election, Musk has been a mainstay at the president-elect’s Mar-a-Lago club, regularly attending meetings with foreign leaders and potential Cabinet appointments while renting a cottage on the grounds. He’s also engaged in policy battles with some of Trump’s prominent supporters, including a clash over high-skill worker visas with more nationalistic factions of his base.

2024-10-30 18:50:37,r/stocks,"Visa plans to fire 1,400 employees and contractors","Multinational payment card services corporation Visa has been planning to lay off nearly 1,400 employees and contractors by the end of 2024. 

According to sources familiar with the matter, Visa intends to fire around 1,400 employees and contractors to advance its strategy to simplify its international business. Initially reported by the Wall Street Journal, the announcement stated that approximately 1,000 of the cuts are projected to remove technology positions, with the majority of the layoffs being focused on Visa’s merchant sales and global digital partnership roles.

The report mentions that a part of the layoffs ensued a week before the news dropped, with Visa encouraging individuals to apply for open positions. However, Visa intends to maintain its workers in the global digital partnership teams employed in their positions through the end of 2024. According to a Visa representative cited by Reuters, the company works towards evolving its operational model to advance its growth, which can in turn lead to the elimination of some roles currently present. Despite this, Visa plans to employ more individuals each year for the foreseeable future, depending on its needs and demands.

Visa’s legal issues

Recently, Visa has been facing legal issues and was under scrutiny from regulators, as well as dissatisfied merchants. For example, in September 2024, The US Justice Department sued Visa for monopolising the debit card market, charging significant fees, and inhibiting competition. The civil antitrust lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, charged the company with violating sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act due to more than 60% of debit transactions in the US running on its debit network.

Moreover, Visa was alleged to unlawfully amassed the capability to extract fees that exceeded what it could charge in a competitive market. At the same time, merchants and banks transferred those funds to consumers by scaling prices or by minimising the quality of services. This led to Visa’s conduct negatively impacting the price of everything. The lawsuit was filed to reinstate competition in the market and to support the US public.

The payment network company also increased its quarterly dividend by 13% to $0.59 per share.

Fiscal Q4 **adjusted EPS** of $2.71, topping the average analyst estimate of $2.58, rose from $2.42 in the prior quarter and $2.33 a year ago.

The company's shares rose 2% in after-hours trading following the announcement.

The global payments technology company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.71 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, beating the analyst consensus of $2.58. Revenue for the quarter came in at $9.6 billion, exceeding the expected $9.49 billion and representing a 12% increase YoY on both a nominal and constant-dollar basis.

Visa's strong performance was underpinned by stable growth in key metrics. Payments volume for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 8% YoY on a constant-dollar basis. Cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, rose 13% on a constant-dollar basis. Total processed transactions reached 61.5 billion, a 10% increase over the prior year.

Ryan McInerney, Chief Executive Officer of Visa, commented on the results: ""Visa had a robust fourth quarter to finish a very strong fiscal year. In the fourth quarter, net revenue and GAAP EPS grew by 12% and 17%, respectively, driven by relatively stable growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions plus strong momentum across new flows and value added services.""

5. As a result, debit networks face what Visa calls ""a chicken-and-egg problem."" To be successful, the network needs many issuers and acquirers to accept the network. But issuers are unlikely to join the debit network unless many merchants already use the network. And merchants are unlikely to join the network unless their customers have cards that work with the network, which requires the issuer to have activated the network. As Visa itself observes, ""build[ing] scale on both sides... with consumers/payers and with merchants/payees"" is ""a herculean task."" Visa further recognizes that these effects create ""an enormous moat"" around its business.

6. Visa's market shares demonstrate just how deep that moat is. Visa has been the largest debit network in the United States for decades. Today, over 60% of all U.S. debit transactions run via Visa's payments network. And Visa's share of card-not-present debit transactions exceeds 65%. Mastercard is a distant second, processing less than 25% of all U.S. debit transactions and card-not-present U.S. debit transactions. Other networks, known as ""PIN networks"" because they originally facilitated ATM transactions for which accountholders needed to enter a PIN, are significantly smaller.

7. This moat is no accident. Coming out of the Great Recession, Visa identified two significant threats to its monopoly—one from legislation and one from emerging technology. Visa took steps to counter both, enriching itself handsomely in the process.

I agree with a value investing philosophy, so to me never selling implies the original investment thesis doesn’t change. 

I think we could have an interesting discussion if we share our age (or age range) and the company in which we trust for the rest of our lives (and why).

I’m in my 30s, so assuming I live for the next 50 years, I believe Lockheed Martin ($LMT) will remain an important player in the defense sector, as I expect war (mostly proxy wars) to continue being used for political interests and if the US DoD sees its budget reduced, our current Western society’s paradigm will be over.

Other candidates I’ve considered are Visa ($V), Microsoft ($MSFT) and Amazon ($AMZN), but I could see all those titans being disrupted someday in the next 50 years.

First a disclaimer : I am a total newbie, so forgive me for the dumb questions.
Couple of weeks ago somebody posted about AXP and why they believed AXP was a good company to invest in. I didn’t buy at the time but kept an eye on the stock. Since then the stock kept going up and I keep reading good comments about the level of service AXP is providing to its customers. 
P/E ratio is lower than Visa and Mastercard, Revenue and Margins are up vs 2023. Yet, when I look at analysts stock objective consensus on IBKR, I see the stock is already well above the consensus which I find confusing.
So my question is : do you guys believe AXP still has room to go higher ?

DoJ to allege Visa monopolized U.S. debit card market - report

Sept 24 (Reuters) - Visa (V.N), opens new tab shares fell 3% on Tuesday after a report said the U.S. Department of Justice plans to file a lawsuit against the world's largest payment processor, alleging it illegally monopolized the country's debit-card market.

The antitrust division of the regulator is set to file a lawsuit as soon as Tuesday, accusing Visa of a range of anti-competitive conduct, Bloomberg News reported, opens new tabon Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.

""We believe this is an immediate negative to shares but we caution these types of antitrust cases are notoriously known for long/winding paths in the U.S.,"" boutique equity research firm Monness, Crespi, Hardt &amp; Co said.
Visa did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

FRESH ANTITRUST SCRUTINY

The company has been facing heightened scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers for years, battling allegations of a duopoly with Mastercard (MA.N), opens new tab . Both companies say they operate in a highly competitive environment.
""The concern appears to be that Visa is using volume-based discounts to discourage merchants from diverting debit volume to other networks,"" brokerage TD Cowen said.

""It appears to us that Justice needs to argue that Visa providing discounts creates a barrier to entry for new rivals that could have driven down pricing even more.""

News of the potential lawsuit comes months after another major legal setback for the duo, when a judge rejected a $30 billion antitrust settlement under which Visa and Mastercard had agreed to limit the fees they charge merchants that accept their credit and debit cards.
Brokerage KBW estimated that the U.S. debit business likely represents 10% of Visa revenues at the high end. It said the potential lawsuit is unlikely to be material in the long-term but expects a prolonged road to resolution.
The prudent course of action for Visa would be to wait until the November election to ""see the intentions of the next administration,"" said Odysseas Papadimitriou, CEO of personal finance firm WalletHub.

""If the next administration's intentions are anything similar to the current one, the goal should be to settle instead of fighting a legal battle. There is a lot of uncertainty when you have protracted court battles, especially against the government.""

Mastercard shares fell 1% in morning trade. Both stocks have underperformed broader markets this year, gaining 11% and 16.5% respectively, compared with the S&amp;P 500's (.SPX), opens new tab near 20% gain.

Walmart Inc. customers will soon have the option to pay directly from their bank accounts with instant transfers for online purchases. The enhanced feature is a flash point in the escalating tensions between merchants and the card networks setting the fees for payment processing.

The world’s largest retailer has offered pay-by-bank through Walmart Pay since earlier this year. Until now, the transactions were akin to digital checks and took roughly three days to finalize when being processed through The Automated Clearing House, the same network often used for bill payments or paycheck deposits. Soon, customers opting for pay-by-bank transactions will see the purchase reflected in their bank account balance instantly – and Walmart will receive the funds immediately.

The consumer advantage of instant pay-by-bank over debit cards is avoiding stacked pending transactions. For customers carrying low balances, pending transactions can open them up to the risk of overdraft or non-sufficient funds fees from their bank, according to Jamie Henry, vice president of emerging payments at Walmart.

In the US, most consumers carry credit or debit cards which offer convenience, fraud protections and, in the case of credit products, rewards programs. However, frustration has mounted among merchants over fees they pay for card processing to banks and networks like Visa and Mastercard.

2024-09-05 13:16:06,r/stocks,Visa debuts a new product designed to make it safer to pay directly from your bank account ,"Visa said it plans to launch a dedicated service for bank transfers, skipping credit cards and the traditional direct debit process.

Visa, which alongside Mastercard is one of the world’s largest card networks, said Thursday it plans to launch a dedicated service for account-to-account (A2A) payments in Europe next year.

Users will be able set up direct debits — transactions that take funds directly from your bank account — on merchants’ e-commerce stores with just a few clicks.

Visa said consumers will be able to monitor these payments more easily and raise any issues by clicking a button in their banking app, giving them a similar level of protection to when they use their cards.

The service should help people deal with problems like unauthorized auto-renewals of subscriptions, by making it easier for people to reverse direct debit transactions and get their money back, Visa said. It won’t initially apply its A2A service to things like TV streaming services, gym memberships and food boxes, Visa added, but this is planned for the future.

The product will initially launch in the U.K. in early 2025, with subsequent releases in the Nordic region and elsewhere in Europe later in 2025. 

Direct debit headaches

The problem currently is that when a consumer sets up a payment for things like utility bills or childcare, they need to fill in a direct debit form.

But this offers consumers little control, as they have to share their bank details and personal information, which isn’t secure, and have limited control over the payment amount.

Static direct debits, for example, require advance notice of any changes to the amount taken, meaning you have to either cancel the direct debit and set up a new one or carry out a one-off transfer.

With Visa A2A, consumers will be able to set up variable recurring payments (VRP), a new type of payment that allows people to make and manage recurring payments of varying amounts.

“We want to bring pay-by-bank methods into the 21st century and give consumers choice, peace of mind and a digital experience they know and love,” Mandy Lamb, Visa’s managing director for the U.K. and Ireland, said in a statement Thursday.

“That’s why we are collaborating with UK banks and open banking players, bringing our technology and years of experience in the payments card market to create an open system for A2A payments to thrive.”

Visa’s A2A product relies on a technology called open banking, which requires lenders to provide third-party fintechs with access to consumer banking data.

Open banking has gained popularity over the years, especially in Europe, thanks to regulatory reforms to the banking system.

The technology has enabled new payment services that can link directly to consumers’ bank accounts and authorize payments on their behalf — provided they’ve got permission.

In 2021, Visa acquired Tink, an open banking service, for 1.8 billion euros ($2 billion). The deal came on the heels of an abandoned bid from Visa to buy competing open banking firm Plaid.

Visa’s buyout of Tink was viewed as a way for it to get ahead of the threat from emerging fintechs building products that allow consumers — and merchants — to avoid paying its card transaction fees.

Merchants have long bemoaned Visa and Mastercard’s credit and debit card fees, accusing the companies of inflating so-called interchange fees and barring them from directing people to cheaper alternatives.

In March, the two companies reached a historic $30 billion settlement to reduce their interchange fees — which are taken out of a merchant’s bank account when a shopper uses their card to pay for something.

Visa didn’t share details on how it would monetize its A2A service. By giving merchants the option to bypass cards for payments, there’s a risk that Visa could potentially cannibalize its own card business.

For its part, Visa told CNBC it is and always has been focused on enabling the best ways for people to pay and get paid, whether that’s through a card or non-card transaction.

2024-07-31 15:25:38,r/stocks,MasterCard beats quarterly profit estimates on sturdy spending,"Mastercard's second-quarter profit beat expectations as customers kept up spending heavily using its cards, sending shares of the payments giant nearly 3% higher before the open on Wednesday.

A tight labor market has ensured job security for customers, allowing them to make purchases without restraint even as the U.S. Federal Reserve keeps monetary policy tight.

However, several of Mastercard's peers have flagged slowing growth, particularly from low-income customers, as wage inflation moderates and elevated interest rates weigh on customer sentiment.

Mastercard's switched volume, which measures the value of transactions processed on its network, were 10% higher than last year.

Cross-border volume, a gauge of travel demand that tracks spending on cards outside the country of their issue, climbed 17% in the same quarter.

Commentary from payments companies is being watched closely for signs that the Fed's rate-hiking campaign is bearing fruit.

Mastercard's profit rose 17%, to $3.3 billion, or $3.50 per share for the three months ended June 30. Excluding one-time costs, it earned $3.59 per share, versus the estimate of $3.51, according to LSEG data.

Its revenue rose 13% from a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, to $7 billion.

The company's shares have risen nearly 5% so far this year, outperforming its chief rival Visa's 1% gain.

Peers American Express, Capital One and Discover Financial have jumped 35%, 16% and 29%, respectively. Capital One agreed to buy Discover in a $35.3-billion deal earlier this year.

2024-07-12 14:40:48,r/stocks,JPMorgan tops second-quarter revenue expectations on strong investment banking ,"JPMorgan Chase on Friday posted second-quarter profit and revenue that topped analysts’ expectations as investment banking fees surged 52% from a year earlier.

Here’s what the company reported:

Earnings: $4.26 per share adjusted vs. $4.19 estimate of analysts surveyed by LSEG

Revenue: $50.99 billion vs. $49.87 billion estimate

The bank said earnings jumped 25% from the year-earlier period to $18.15 billion, or $6.12 per share. Excluding items related to the bank’s stake in Visa, profit was $4.26 per share.

Revenue rose 20% to $50.99 billion, topping the consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by LSEG, helped by better-than-expected investment banking fees and equities trading results.

CEO Jamie Dimon noted in the release that his firm was wary of potential future risks, including higher-than-expected inflation and interest rates, even while stock and bond valuations currently “reflect a rather benign economic outlook.”

“The geopolitical situation remains complex and potentially the most dangerous since World War II — though its outcome and effect on the global economy remain unknown,” Dimon said. “There has been some progress bringing inflation down, but there are still multiple inflationary forces in front of us: large fiscal deficits, infrastructure needs, restructuring of trade and remilitarization of the world.”

Shares of JPMorgan slipped 1% in premarket trading.

A rebound in Wall Street activity, especially on the advisory side, was expected to aid banks this quarter, and JPMorgan’s results bear that out.

JPMorgan reaped $2.3 billion in investment banking fees, exceeding the StreetAccount estimate by roughly $300 million.

Equities trading revenue jumped 21% to $3 billion, topping the estimate by $230 million, on strong derivatives results. Fixed income trading jumped 5% to $4.8 billion, matching the estimate.

But the bank had a $3.05 billion provision for credit losses in the quarter, exceeding the $2.78 billion estimate, which indicated that the bank expects more loan defaults in the future.

“JPMorgan has navigated a challenging interest rate environment very well,” said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consulting firm Opimas.

Still, while banking and equities trading boosted results, “We see Main Street banking beginning to sputter,” Marenzi said. “Provisions for credit losses were up significantly, showing us that JPMorgan is expecting to see a rough patch in the US economy.”

Wells Fargo and Citigroup also report earnings Friday, while Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley report next week.

2024-06-16 06:18:34,r/stocks,IRL V vs MA Investment Research/Experiment,"Context: One of the ways I make money during the summer is at my summer job, where I oversee a few other employees at a mini golf/driving range/batting cage place. My main job is not to work registers but I do help a little bit on them. 

I have been wanting to invest in one of either V or MA but I was unsure which to choose. So today I had the idea to take a tally of every debit/credit card I got to see which type people were using, basically the parking lot test for debit/credit cards. There were purchases today ranging from $8-$300

This was in a 3.5 hour span and wasn’t nearly all the customers that came, just all the customers I was on a register for. I had 54 total tally marks. With the following results,

Visa - 62.9%
Mastercard- 29.6%
AMEX - 7.4%

I was curious what my results looked like compared to the market share I could find online. The market share I found online was 

Visa - 61.1%
Mastercard - 25.4%
AMEX - 11.3%
Discover - 2.1%

This was pretty similar to the results I found in my small sample size which I thought was cool.

This lead me to the question, which company should I invest in? MA or V? I originally thought V because they are the most popular card and have the most expensive transactions (not in my data but found on the website I found the market share - statista). But then I thought about MA because of the greater opportunity to increase market share. V would be better if the market grows but MA would be more feasible if the market is stagnant is what I was originally thinking.

I haven’t looked into financials or anything like that yet I was just going off of reasoning and other data so far, but basically the whole point of this long post was to share my experiment and ask if you like V or MA more as a long term investment (I’m 17 so I have 30-50 year window).

2024-04-29 22:37:32,r/stocks,"VISA and JPM, 2 companies for 2 economic scenarios","Disclaimer I held a position in Visa and a smaller one in JP Morgan for a couple years, and plan on adding some shares in the next few days

1. Rates cuts and higher inflation = great time for VISA.
A expansionary monetary policy would increase consumer spending in real terms, and accelarate nominal spending even higher because of inflation. Both of these trends would benefit VISA, since it has great pricing power and charges a fixed percentage on any transaction. VISA has little need for capital, so an increase in nominal spending would boost revenues while inflation is unlikely to affect his costs, thus further expanding it's already incredible margins. I believe the transition away from cash to card would be accelarated, both because of less cash in the wallet and the advantages of financing purchases at lower rates.
I think visa could return 15% y/y in this situation, with 12 free cash flow growth and FCY of 3%.
The only risk I see are slower growth (current PE of 30) and governament regualtions.

2. High rates low inflation = great time for JPM. In this situation JP Morgan chase would probably be able to expand its balance sheet, because of people moving their asset into JPM from smaller and riskier banks, as well as Aquistions of distressed banks very short on liquidity. In addition, the Bank would be able to employ this capital at high rates, and increase its credit spread substantially. All of this should lead to massive profits, putting JPM fortress balance sheet in an enviable position, like we saw in 2022.
I'm this scenario I think 15% returns are possible ( 6% free cash flow growth and 9% FCY)
The main risk I see is a fall in CIB revenues and some losses on the asset side (few distressed loans and marking to market some bonds with high duration)

The financial sector is historically quite risky, and prudence is key when investing, however I think these companies will do great is some scenario, and good in others, and survive in all but the most tragic ones, thus MAY offer and interesting Risk/Reward proposition.

And yes, currently they are but with Capital One’s recent announcement of their intent to acquire Discover, I’m beginning to wonder about the long term implications of such a deal. 

There are many reasons to not, but it is my view that regulators will approve the deal. Were this to happen, does anyone think that COF could slowly catch up to AXP? 

Capital One has been inching into the luxury space with their Venture/Venture X cards and I can easily see them trying to expand into this market. I can also see them working to slowly integrate their cards off the Visa/Mastercard network and onto their own, similar to Amex.

2024-04-16 14:23:23,r/stocks,Mastercard (MA) DCF Analysis,"***Note: Not Financial Advice***

# Introduction:

MA is one of the duopoly in the card network business. The card network business is a unique model that heavily rewards first mover advantage, with large barriers to entry due to the large fixed cost associated with setting up POS, achieving large merchant acceptance locations, and gaining the trust of major financial institutions. The card network business has large potential but also large hurdles to overcome, with regulators and competitors all eyeing a piece of MA's business.

# Market:

APAC and some EMEA have one of the lowest credit card penetration rates as their society is “less developed” due to a lack of the relevant and appropriate infrastructure to support cashless payments ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/675371/ownership-of-credit-cards-globally-by-country/)).  
  
I believe that most of the developing world would follow a similar trend as China in terms of how payment has progressed. In the early 2010s, China was mostly a cash-based society ([SOURCE](https://www.thunes.com/news/china-payment-trends-and-popular-payment-methods/#:~:text=China%20is%20the%20biggest%20market,and%20credit%20cards%20also%20used)) coincidentally then, smartphone penetration in the market was \~75%. Both Alipay and WeChat pay with a large user base took advantage of that and introduced mobile payments. Part of the growth equation was also due to mass merchant adoption, as merchants only needed QR codes without the need for costly POS systems that traditional credit cards require.  
  
A potential competitor to credit cards is P2P payments like Venmo where payments are made directly from 1 party to the other through mobile wallets ([SOURCE](https://www.americanbanker.com/payments/news/south-africas-digital-payments-plan-takes-a-page-from-indias-upi)). However, the largest flaw with P2P payment is that since transactions are instantaneous the onus is on the consumer to verify the legitimacy of a transaction before proceeding. P2P payments don't have the same extensive fraud protection that traditional credit card payments offer.  
  
In India, a credit card is still seen as a “premium” product with credit cards only having a penetration rate of 5.5% ([SOURCE](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zennonkapron/2023/06/22/why-credit-card-adoption-is-rising-in-india/?sh=29b76dcb5589)). However, getting in the way of mass credit card adoption is the competing United Payment Interface(UPI). UPIs are smartphone applications that allow for peer-to-peer RTP between merchants and consumers. UPI already has a strong foothold in India at 50 million merchant acceptance locations. The future going forward will be that UPI will be able to be linked to credit cards. “In terms of data, around INR 39 bn count of UPI transactions were recorded in 2021, compared to INR 211 Mn credit cards POS transactions” ([SOURCE](https://bfsi.economictimes.indiatimes.com/blog/will-upi-kill-credit-/debit-cards-in-the-coming-years-/91535955)).  
  
Mobile payments could lead to the acceleration of the growth of transactions using credit/debit cards. However, mobile payments do take a cut out of the fees so it could cut into MA’s topline. This would be an even more prevalent issue in the future when these mobile payment providers have an established reward system rivaling traditional credit card companies.  
  
Over the upcoming decade, ASEAN is expected to be the fastest-growing emerging market ([SOURCE](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/mi/research-analysis/asean-economic-outlook-in-2024-jan24.html)) fueled by robust global Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), strong recovery of the tourism sector in the region, and the rebound of domestic consumption of their larger trade partners e.g. China and India which drives ASEAN’s exports, this effect is further compounded as certain of their trade partners have an aging population with large disposable income. The kinds of exports that ASEAN is expected to contribute to will be in the form of raw material, and value-added exports e.g. semiconductors. ASEAN is expected to grow at a Y/Y CAGR rate of 10.00% over the next 13 years ([SOURCE](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/mi/research-analysis/asean-economic-outlook-in-2024-jan24.html)).   


# Revenue:

Mastercard breaks down its revenue into “payment network” and “value-added services and solutions”.  
  
**Payment Network**  
Payment network is when MA charges a % fee based on Gross Dollar Volume (GDV) of all mastercard-related transactions, GDV is calculated through purchases made using an MA-branded card.  
  
MA is building out its service to roll out in China, so far, it has partnered with ICBC and Bank of Communications, but they have a long road ahead to establish its presence in China. Initially, to pay using Alipay or WeChat in China, you have to open a Chinese bank account. However, Alipay and WeChat have begun allowing consumers to link the app to their foreign credit card. China is the perfect ground for MA to establish itself, given that the value of mobile transactions in China in 2022 is 500 Trillion Yuan ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1060702/china-mobile-payment-transaction-value/#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20the%20total%20transaction,payment%20transactions%20in%20the%20country)).

I believe that payment network should be broken down into APMEA and Non-APMEA, APMEA represents a large growth opportunity as the APMEA region is beginning to explore mobile payments and global e-commerce. Whereas the Non-APMEA region represents a mature region that has little wiggle room left to grow.  
  
  
***APMEA***  
When forecasting the number of transactions, I forecasted it with a backloaded growth rate as I believe that GDV for APMEA will grow heavily through a larger number of transactions as more and more people in the APMEA region are wealthy enough to be offered the luxury of a credit card. On top of that, the growing smartphone penetration rate and growth in mobile wallets all help to boost the total number of transactions.  
  
When forecasting the GDV/Transactions, I believe that historically GDV/Transaction had been declining for APMEA due to the poor macro environment from COVID-19 affecting disposable income of the APMEA region which leads to unwillingness to make purchases. However, I assume that it takes another 1 year of forecast for the lingering effects of COVID-19 to dissipate and for consumers to regain the confidence to make bigger purchases. On top of that, I believe that in the future GDV/Transaction in the APMEA region will grow in part due to the rising disposable income of these countries attributed to their strong forecasted GDP growth, and as consumers get used to the convenience of MA and trust the reliability &amp; security of their payment network, they will utilize MA for a greater number of transactions leading to higher GDV per transaction.  
  
When forecasting %GDV earned, opting for less granularity I forecasted it to taper towards the perpetual inflation rate.

  
***Non-APMEA***  
When forecasting the number of transactions, I assumed that the Non-APMEA regions are sufficiently matured so the number of transactions is unlikely to have any large spikes. So, I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.  
When forecasting the GDV/Transaction, I assumed that the Non-APMEA regions are sufficiently matured so there are unlikely to be any large spikes. So, I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.  
When forecasting %GDV earned, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of perpetual inflation rate. This is especially true given how there is growing legislation against MA and VISA in the Western world for holding a duopoly. So, I assumed that MA or VISA would be unlikely to raise %GDV earned through higher merchant discount rates.

&amp;#x200B;

***Value-added services and solutions***  
Value-added services and solutions refer to MA’s other services e.g. Cyber and Intelligence solutions, open banking solutions, etc. MA believes that value-added services and solutions help to drive payment network. “And if you look at some of these big wins…all have a significant contribution of services…oftentimes, they are one of the reasons that we win those deals” - 2023 Q4 Earnings conference. A few examples of the services MA provides are:  
  
1) Data, because MA handles a large number of transactions they accumulate a lot of consumer data. MA acquired a personalization company to help merchants analyze data to make personalized recommendations.  
  
2) Biometric, MA is looking for new ways to make payment even more seamless through using biometric data.   
  
3) Cyber, Click-To-Pay, MA allows for your credit card details to be stored safely so that for subsequent transactions you can just conveniently bring up your details previously entered.  
  
Given that the success of Value-added services and solutions is hinged on the success of MA’s payment network, I forecasted it as a % of Payment Network, forecasting it as a % of historic averages.

# Cost:

MA has 3 different costs “COGS”, “Marketing”, and “Others”. COGS refers to G&amp;A as MA relies on its workforce to produce its G&amp;S.  
  
When forecasting COGS, looking at the historic numbers of employees ([SOURCE](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MA/mastercard/number-of-employees#:~:text=Mastercard%20total%20number%20of%20employees,a%2014.29%25%20increase%20from%202020)). I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.  
  
When forecasting cost per employee, I assumed that historic trends continue for 5 years before wages grow in line with the perpetual inflation rate.  
  
When forecasting Marketing and Others, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.

# WACC:

RFR (1M Avg) = 4.23%  
Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MA/)) = 1.07  
Stable Market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%

AT-COD = 4.25%

Shares O/S = 932.89M  
Market Value of Equity = 439569.15M

Market Value of Debt = 15138.04M  
%Debt = 3.34%  
%Equity = 96.66%  
%WACC = 8.99%

# Conclusion:

Ultimately, in my base case, I value MA at $455.14 per share. I believe that the markets have correctly priced MA, seeing the value that MA could potentially bring to the consumers. News of the Credit Card Competition act has not eroded investor's confidence in the stock and what it brings. However, I believe that going forward MA has a strong potential to grow exponentially but also the potential to see their growth rate taper aggressively. This is hinged on how well MA can execute its growth strategy in critical areas like China and APMEA.

“By negotiating directly with merchants, we have reached a settlement with meaningful concessions that address true pain points small merchants have identified,” Kim Lawrence, president, North America at Visa, said in a Tuesday press release. “Importantly, we are making these concessions while also maintaining the safety, security, innovation, protections, rewards and access to credit that are so important to millions of Americans and to our economy.”

Rob Beard, chief legal officer, general counsel and head of global policy at Mastercard, said in a Tuesday press release: “As the court reviews the settlement, we will focus our energy on continuing to provide consumers, small businesses and all business owners what they expect from Mastercard — a better payments experience, strong value and peace of mind.”

The rollbacks and caps on swipe fees will deliver at least $29.79 billion in savings during the five years after the settlement is approved, the merchants’ lawyers said in a Tuesday press release.

The policy changes included in the settlement are expected to provide “substantially greater additional savings” because merchants will have additional leverage when negotiating with Mastercard and Visa, the release said.

“This settlement is the culmination of eight years of hard-fought litigation and detailed, painstaking negotiations,” Steve Shadowen of Hilliard Shadowen LLP, co-lead counsel, said in the release. “It provides comprehensive market-based solutions to too-high swipe fees, while providing immediate fee relief to merchants as they make these new competitive tools work for them.”

Mastercard and Visa have faced legislation and lawsuits around merchants’ claims that they overcharged merchants on interchange fees and blocked them from steering their customers to other payments that did not charge fees.

In this podcast, they focus on a single company and do a deep dive. They always have a guest who is accredited and knows the business well. They go over the bull case and the bear case for the company . Great content IMO.

The title may be a touch misleading at first, while they do talk about a Canadian specific financial stuff such as TFSA's ,RRSP's, Canadian real estate ect, the vast majority of the show is based around equities. They do talk about some (very good) Canadian companies, but more so US equities, a bit of crypto ect. They get guest on the show from time to time that have some awesome hot takes.

2023-11-29 20:44:26,r/stocks,Is anyone buying the narrative Black Friday sales were so amazing this y ear?,"Okay so I'm coming at this as someone in eCommerce so the discussion below is kind of framed around that but was curious your guys thoughts.

So once again we've been told this year is the biggest black friday ever in terms of sales. Well first off I'm not buying it and I'll get into that further below, but I had a question if anyone knows as most of these articles are pretty vague. Here's what I'm wondering...

1. Where are they pulling these stats from? Is it from a merchant processor, Shopify, Visa or MC or retail organization?
2. Are these numbers just factoring in Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the entire week around Black Friday or the entire month of November?

EDIT
So it depends on what articles you read some of these numbers come from industry associations while others are coming from companies like Adobe. In terms of what period of time these articles are looking at a lot of the ones I'm reading are specifically about Black Friday which make this claim even more unbelievable to me. Black Friday/Cyber Monday is no longer a Friday to Monday thing, its become at the very least a Monday before thanksgiving to Cyber Monday thing with most retailers extending sales to Tues or Wed so in reality were talking like a 8 or 9 day event and that's not even considering the businesses who are essentially making the entire month of November a sale. I would expect that to dilute sales on the actual Black Friday day which is the day many of these articles are referencing

So here's my take on this. Last year we were told it was the biggest Black Friday ever. Well I went to a few stores and they were emptier than a regular Tuesday afternoon, obviously more people shop online these but I still don't buy its the best sales numbers ever. Last year inflation was running 9% and we were told best black friday ever by 2.3% though I believe that was later revised down, same thing that happens with GDP, job numbers, everything, they give rosy numbers make headlines and revise down later and nobody really pays attention.

That said assuming the same number of shoppers went out and bought the same number of items you'd expect sales would need to at a minimum be 9% higher than previous years adjusted for inflation to be break even, you'd need more to actually say sales were better. And this is if we buy the idea that inflation was only 9% which the fed and government told us, obviously they pick and choose what's factored so true inflation is actually much higher.

I would expect things to be worse this year, we've had more layoffs, we now have an additional year of high inflation so people are even more tapped out ie its not just the 3% inflation we have this year if you buy that number, were going on 3 or 4 years of inflation which has accumulated and driven prices higher. We also have record credit card debt, record low savings levels, etc.

I just find it hard to believe this years black friday and cyber monday sales were 7% or 9% depending on the source better than previous years. Assuming they are only looking at the weekend or even the whole week its even harder to believe as in many ways the entire month of November has turned into the month of black friday. Curious your take as well as your personal experience if you're in ecommerce. My sales were about the same as last year which is great, margins were a bit worse, but we've also substantially grown our emails and sms lists over the past year, had that not happenned I'd expect my sales would be considerably worse.

TLDR

So after writing this I dug into some more numbers, read a few more articles. Here's my take. eCommerce has grown over the years and will continue to grow, it got a big boost during covid but will continue to grow as time goes on. Black Friday in store is pretty much a thing of the past at this point so what we're seeing is a shuffle of brick and mortar sales becoming ecommerce sales which is why Adobe is reporting how amazing their users sales were. Then the obvious things are costing what say 30% more today than they were 3 years ago. What does all that mean, Black Friday sales were likely pretty fucking terrible if they are A. inflation adjusted and B. if there wasn't a natural movement of brick and mortar sales becoming ecommerce sales.",0,0,rulesforrebels,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/186y70l/is_anyone_buying_the_narrative_black_friday_sales/,186y70l
2023-11-03 18:53:41,r/stocks,"It's PayPal, again","I noticed that nobody had posted about it yet today, so I thought, ""Well, gotta fix that”.  
Mainly because I would like to address the most widespread beliefs among the critics: PayPal has no moat and the competition is squeezing them.  


  
**THERE IS NO MOAT**  
People tend to naively overlook the fact that network effect-based moats are the strongest forms of competitive advantages, and that PayPal has 35 million-plus merchants and 400 million-plus customers. Customers join (and subsequently stick around) the network, because PayPal is still, to this day, perceived to be the most secure alternative for online payments (it is second only to Visa on the list of the most trusted financial services brands). For as long as customers will stick around, so merchants will, too, whether they like it or not.  


  
**COMPETITION IS SQUEEZING THEM**  
There is no single KPI indicating, as of yet, some sort of permanent business deterioration whatsoever. According to the ""Q3 23 PayPal Earnings Release"", the revenue has been growing 8% at spot over the last 12 months, branded checkout TPV \~6%, and PSP2 TPV (unbranded processing) \~32%. This ain't a dying company, at all.  
**Some food for thought for the critics:**  
•	In terms of market share, Apple Pay is clearly lagging behind, losing to PayPal in all segments (top 10K sites, top 100K sites, top 1M sites, and the entire web, really), which just goes to show how difficult it is for competitors to gain market share against PayPal the ""Dinosaur"", even for the leader of the mobile-wallet market;  
•	Braintree’s aggressive land-grab strategy in the US likely contributed to the sharp deceleration in Adyen’s North America revenue growth. Adyen is about the same size as privately-held Stripe, based on publicly available information regarding their payments volume. Both are approximately twice the size of Braintree. I'd suggest you to tinker with the numbers to check out for yourself the impact that Braintree, a subsidiary with razor-thin margins, growing at a rate of over 30%, can have on the whole company's bottom line.  
•	While Zelle is bigger than Venmo in terms of TPV and has as much active users as Venmo, the latter is still the most commonly used peer-to-peer payment app, after PayPal itself. Venmo's stickiness or ability to retain and engage users is significant and should not be ignored.  


  
**TO THE MOON AND BACK**  
The stock has lost more than 80% from its historical peak due to its inability to meet investors' expectations regarding growth and profit margins, not because the quality of the business in itself is deteriorating.  
The company has returned $5.4B to stockholders through share repurchases on a trailing 12-month basis, it currently offers an earnings yield of about 6%, and it has a new CEO which, in my opinion, is the perfect fit for the role. As a matter of fact, the only two things I didn't like about PayPal were the bonkers valuation and the management. And they are both gone now.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**A QUICK VALUATION**

In order to achieve a 10% annualized return with a required margin of safety of at least 50% and no reliance on multiple expansion, the company must consistently achieve a growth rate of 7%. Notably, the company's year-over-year quarterly growth has consistently met or exceeded this threshold without exception since 2014. Furthermore, the global payment processing industry has been growing at a CAGR in the double digits over the last decade and is expected to keep growing at similar rates throughout this decade.  
The current price offers a favorable risk-reward balance in the most probable scenario, without relying on the most optimistic best-case scenarios needed to justify certain other stock valuations.",141,59,LeBourruBienfaisant,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17n0ugq/its_paypal_again/,17n0ugq
2023-10-25 13:47:58,r/stocks,Worldline shares halve on European economy warning,"&gt;Shares in Worldline fell more than 50 per cent on Wednesday to a record low after the French payments group warned that revenues and margins would take a hit this year from a deteriorating economic outlook.  
&gt;  
&gt;One of the world’s largest payments specialists, Worldline was spun out of French tech group Atos in 2014. It grew rapidly through a series of acquisitions, and entered the CAC 40 index of French blue-chip companies in 2020, with a market value of more than €11bn.By mid-morning on Wednesday, Worldline’s value had shrunk to about €3bn and its shares were temporarily suspended from trading on the Paris stock exchange.  
&gt;  
&gt;Shares in payments groups have been hit this year as interest rate rises have dented the fintech sector. Rival Adyen shed more than 40 per cent of its value in August when its profits fell short of expectations, while share prices across the sector have failed to keep up with those of the incumbent card networks Visa and Mastercard in recent years.  
&gt;  
&gt;Worldline’s warning on Wednesday sparked further alarm, however, and dragged down shares in its European peers. Nexi fell 12 per cent in Milan trading, while Adyen was almost 10 per cent lower in Amsterdam.  
&gt;  
&gt;Worldline said it expected revenues to grow 6 to 7 per cent in 2023, down from a previous forecast of 8 to 10 per cent. It also said operating margins before depreciation and amortisation would drop by 1.5 percentage points this year, when it had previously expected a 1 percentage point increase. Third-quarter sales also missed expectations, climbing 4.8 per cent at constant exchange rates to €1.18bn.  
&gt;  
&gt;The group blamed a gloomier economic outlook in Europe and particularly in Germany for the downgrades, adding that it had also cut ties with some merchants as it enforced a stricter approach to cyber security risks.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We face now more challenges than we anticipated even until very recently. The first one is obviously the economic slowdown in Europe . . . most particularly in Germany,” chief executive Gilles Grapinet said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Worldline also scrapped long-term targets beyond 2023 in the update.Grapinet said the pressures facing the company were temporary, but added that it did “not want to bet” that issues such as the German slowdown would “improve meaningfully and quickly in the near future”.  
&gt;  
&gt;Worldline shares had already taken a knock this week after technical problems at some of its payment systems in France over the weekend. These were quickly resolved, but temporarily left clients such as fast-food chain McDonald’s and supermarket group Carrefour unable to process some payments.

2023-04-15 07:25:36,r/stocks,Shift4 ($FOUR) profit soars 488% as it stomps rivals," **Shift4** ($**FOUR**) is posting profit growth far above other companies in its industry group.  

Its fourth-quarter earnings soared 488%. That was the biggest quarterly gain among 40 companies in the credit card and payments industry group, except for the thinly-traded **CPI Card Group** (**PMTS**).

Revenue growth in Q4 was above average for the industry group, up 35%, slowing from 68%, 44%, and 45% in the previous three quarters.

With first-quarter results due in early May, Shift4 is not letting up. Analysts expect earnings to swell 117% to 33 cents per share. Sales are estimated to climb 29% to $192.3 million.

## IPO Stock's Growth Should Continue

Longer-term growth estimates are also bullish, with profits expected to rise 52% this year and another 43% in 2024. 

While **Visa** (**V**) and **Mastercard** (**MC**) are the industry's giants (market caps of $431 billion and $352 billion), there are dozens of smaller companies competing for digital payments. And Shift4 is emerging.

Allentown, Pa.-based Shift4 **gets most of its revenue** processing payments in the hotel, restaurant, and casino industries. If the U.S. economy sinks into a recession, those industries would surely see their results weaken.

Shift4 has expanded into stadiums, airlines, charities, and food and beverage companies. And it's expanding into Europe through acquisitions.

In a favorable sign, Shift4 seems untouched by the banking crisis, a **Bank of America analyst noted**. Other analysts see potential in the company's subscription-based profit model.

## IPO Stock Forming Unusual Base Pattern

The stock is forming an **ascending base**. You don't see many of those patterns, and they can sneak up during a price uptrend. The base consists of three pullbacks of typically 10% to 20% over a period of nine to 16 weeks. MarketSmith pattern recognition is adjusted to identify pullbacks of 6% to 25% in ascending bases.

As with other bases, look for a **buy point** 10 cents above the highest level in the pattern. For Shift4, that entry is at 76.50. Volume should climb at least 40% above average when the stock tops the buy point.

Shift4 came public at $23 per share in June 2020. The IPO stock rose as high as 104.11 in April 2021 before surrendering the entire gain, to a low at 29.39 last July. Shares have been recovering since then, and the ascending base is the second pattern of that recovery process.",31,26,No_Cow1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12mr996/shift4_four_profit_soars_488_as_it_stomps_rivals/,12mr996
2023-04-12 08:49:31,r/stocks,2 Stocks with 10% or more short interest now," 

Recent economic data, including the cooling labor market and slowing service sector, and a string of bank collapses are raising the odds of a recession. Amid a challenging macro environment, investors should stay away from risky stocks. 

Shift4 Payments, Inc. (**FOUR****)**, ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. ($**CHPT**), which possess a relatively high short interest. 

Generally, short interest as a percentage of float above 10% indicates a pessimistic sentiment surrounding the stock. It also heightens the probability of a short squeeze, which leads to unexpected price increases.

Before delving deeper into the fundamentals of these heavily shorted stocks, let’s discuss what’s affecting the overall market sentiment.

Last month, the Federal Reserve approved a quarter-percentage-point interest-rate hike and indicated that rate increases are approaching an end. The Fed’s decision marked its ninth consecutive rate hike since March 2022, bringing its federal funds rate to a 4.75%-5% range. 

The central bank’s efforts to cool the labor market are finally coming into effect. Total nonfarm payroll employment added 236,000 net jobs in March after adding 326,000 in February and a 472,000 gain in January.

According to Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, the likelihood of a recession is rising after a series of weak economic indicators. Summers also wants the Fed to rethink its internal models, which failed to anticipate the surge in inflation that began in 2021 and couldn’t capture risks emerging in the financial system.

Amid growing recessionary pressures, investors remain highly uncertain about the economic outlook. Given this backdrop, avoiding highly shorted stocks **$FOUR**, **$CHPT** could be wise.

**REVISED: 2023 STOCK MARKET OUTLOOK**

Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of the featured stocks:

**Shift4 Payments, Inc. ($****FOUR****)**

FOUR offers various software and payment processing solutions. Its omnichannel card acceptance and processing solutions include credit, debit, contactless card, Europay, Mastercard and Visa, QR Pay, and alternative payment methods. It also provides proprietary omnichannel gateway, integrated and mobile point-of-sale (POS) solutions, and risk management solutions.

FOUR has a short interest of 8.47 million and a short float of 15.81%. 

FOUR’s trailing 12-month gross profit margin of 23.59% is 60.5% lower than the industry average of 59.75%. Likewise, the stock’s trailing 12-month EBIT and net income margins of 4.14% and 3.77% are lower than the industry averages of 22.13% and 26.65%, respectively.

For the year that ended December 31, 2022, FOUR’s cash outflows from investing activities came in at $516.80 million, up 203.1% year-over-year, while cash outflows from financing activities were $214.60 million, compared to cash inflows of $471.2 million during the prior year. As of December 31, 2022, the company’s current liabilities were $268.30 million, up 46% from December 31, 2021.

Over the past month, shares of FOUR have gained 10.5% and 55.8% over the past six months to close the last trading session at $72.16. A significant recent spike in the stock’s share price indicates a short squeeze.

&amp;#x200B;

And its trailing 12-month EBITDA margin of negative 67.66% compares to the industry average of 13.21%. Also, its trailing 12-month net income margin of negative 73.73% compares to the 6.50% industry average.

CHPT’s total operating expenses increased 15.1% year-over-year to $111.30 million in the fourth quarter that ended January 31, 2023. The company reported a loss from operations of $78.31 million for the quarter.

Over the past six months, CHPT has plunged 32.1% to close the last trading session at $9.35. The stock has declined 43.4% over the past year.",0,0,Theo_011,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12jd3nl/2_stocks_with_10_or_more_short_interest_now/,12jd3nl
2023-04-10 12:43:24,r/stocks,A Deep Dive on PayPal: Is it a good time to Buy? [DD],"A couple of years ago, PayPal was all the hype. Today, the stock is down 75% from its all-time high. Once a growth stock, PayPal is now moving towards value stock territory. The big question here is this. Is PayPal worth buying right now? Is it a bargain or is it a value trap?

# Operations

First of all, let's look at PayPal's operations. PayPal's main source of revenue are the fees that PayPal charges for completing transactions and other payment-related services. Other revenue sources include foreign currency conversion fees and also fees for purchasing or selling cryptocurrencies. As such, PayPal's business model is based on the volume of transactions. The more transactions, the more fees the company gets. In 2022, users, transactions and payment volume on PayPal increased. 

* 2% increase in users to 435 million with 8.6 million new net accounts added  
Out of these, 400 million were consumer active accounts and 35 million were active merchant accounts
* 16% increase in number of transactions to 22.3 billion
* 9% total payment volume increase to $1.36 trillion on a spot basis so basically without adjusting for any forex changes.

The family of PayPal brands includes Braintree, Chargehound, Honey, Venmo and others so the company has a very strong brand presence. I keep seeing an ad for Honey almost every single day, I think the other brands are more US-focused (I'm UK-based), but the gist of it is that PayPal is becoming more popular, more established. [Recently, PayPal added more features to its payment solutions for small businesses.](https://investor.pypl.com/news-and-events/news-details/2023/PayPal-Adds-New-Features-to-Its-Complete-Payments-Solution-for-Online-Small-Businesses/default.aspx) The main change was increasing the range of payment options for customers by including Apple Pay along with saving payment options and others. 

# Competition

When it comes to mobile payments, PayPal competes with the likes of Google Pay, Cash App, Zelle, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Venmo although Venmo is actually owned by PayPal. They all have some pros and cons. However, PayPal appears to have the best international payment support. PayPal owns Xoom which allows users to send payments to users in 131 countries without the recipient needing an app or a smartphone. The recipient can just pick up the payment at their local bank. PayPal also allows you to send money to people in over 200 countries worldwide as long as they also have the app. PayPal is also ahead of the competition when it comes to web and website payments since you can complete the payment by using any web browser. Doesn't matter if it's Firefox, Chrome or Safari. However, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google Pay can be used with smart watches which are becoming more and more popular.

***US market***  
In fact, this may be one of the reasons why Apple Pay is the most widely used mobile payment service in the US. 43.9 million people report using it at least once followed by Starbucks with 31.2 million. Yes, Starbucks, I know, I'm surprised as well, but it seems to be a popular method of payment in the US. Google Pay follows with 25 million users and Samsung Pay with 16.3 million users. Again, this is in the US.

***Worldwide***  
In terms of total mobile payment users worldwide, you have AliPay and WeChat Pay with 650 and 500 million users respectively, followed by Apple Pay with 507 million, Google Pay with 421 million and PayPal with 377 million. Venmo has 52 million, but it counted separately. If you combine the two since Paypal owns Venmo, Paypal comes ahead of Google Pay with 429 million users. Plus, AliPay and WeChat Pay are pretty much the status quo in China, but they are not that big outside of China. In fact, I'm not sure you can get them outside of China unless you are a Chinese national. Essentially, Google Pay, Apple Pay and Paypal are the big international names. Now, Google and Apple have a big advantage because they obviously produce their own phones, they have iOS and Android and they pretty much come with built-in Apple and Google Pay. They also have the smart watches which integrate with these payment apps. 

***Total Payment Volume competition***  
Now, it would be really good if we could see the official total payment volume through these apps and compare it with Paypal. It could be the case where because the payment apps are installed by default, it seems they have a large userbase, but in reality users don't use them as much as Paypal or they just use them for small purchases. [The closest stats I could find were in this article here](https://www.paymentsjournal.com/apple-pay-transaction-volume-news-creates-mixed-messaging/). The author claims that Apple Pay has a total transaction volume of $6 trillion whereas Google Pay had $2.5 trillion. However, these are not official statistics by either of these companies. There are also disagreements over what exactly constitutes an Apple Pay or Google Pay transaction. In most cases, people don't pay with the apps, they just use the wallet option to pay with their actual card instead of paying with the digital payment app. Again, we don't know the exact transaction volume and we can just speculate, but we can see why Apple and Google Pay are massive competitors to Paypal. Still, the good thing is that the market for mobile payment apps is growing fast worldwide. There are a lot more users left to capture and Paypal is in a good position to do that as one of the leading payment apps, but enough about operations.

# Financials metrics

We know Paypal is big and we know it's not going anywhere. The company is a viable competitor to Google and Apple, but what are the financials of Paypal? Are they profitable? Are they efficient? What's the case here?

To answer these questions, I will look at Paypal's current and historical metrics and compare them to the company's peers in the Transaction and Payment Processing sector in the US. Quick note on the sector metrics. This sector is dominated by Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, Fiserv, Block and Fidelity National Information Services. These 6 companies make up 77% of the total revenue in this sector. Meanwhile, 18 of the 35 companies in the sector are losing money. Basically, take the sector data with some hint of salt. I want to provide some comparison for Paypal, but at the same time we have a duopoly of Visa and Mastercard at the top and a lot of new players at the bottom.

Okay, so lets look at profitability. Paypal has a:

* gross profit margin of 42.35% which is below its 5-year average of 45.79% and the sector median of 47.32%
* net income margin of 8.79% is also below its 5-year average of 14.58%, but above the sector median of 0.57%
* levered free cash flow margin stands at 12.1% compared to its 5-year average of 14.58% and the sector median of 4.73%
* Return on Equity is decent at 11.5% compared to the 5-year average of 16.7% and the sector median of 11.05%

Overall, Paypal is doing well. Their metrics have declined over the last few years which is worrying, but the change has not been that drastic \[yet\]. It's good to monitor these metrics of course because this could turn into a red flag if the trend continues.

# Analyst Expectations

Despite the above, analysts are expecting a steady growth in earnings per share over the next few years. The consensus is:

* 18.33% in 2023
* 15.28% in 2024
* 13.07% in 2025

In fact, analysts have recently started revising their expectations up which is a good sign. Basically, the sentiment towards Paypal is improving after a year and a half of declining expectations. This type of expectations change often leads to a reversal in stock price so this is one reason why I am turning bullish on Paypal.

Paypal has historically shown really good growth in revenue and earnings. Their compounded annual revenue growth is 17% since 2013 with their revenue going from $6,727 billion in 2013 to $27,518 billion in 2022. Their compounded annual earnings growth is 10.9% with earnings growing from $955 million in 2013 to $2.42 billion in 2022. By the looks of it, this type of growth can be sustained for at least another few years.

# Valuation

This is really, really good, mainly because the stock has lately been priced as a value stock. Paypal has:

* adjusted PE ratio of 18.15 compared to the 5-year average of 41.72.
* adjusted forward PE ratio of 15.34 compared to the 5-year average of 37.94
* price-to-earnings growth ratio of only 1.1 compared to the 5-year average of 2
* relatively low forward price-to-book of 3.74 compared to the 5-year average of 8.1
* forward price-to-cash-flow of 11.84 compared to their 5-year average of 27.4

The way I see it, there are 2 reasons for the low valuation.

One, Paypal had a massively inflated stock price in 2021. Typically, you see a corresponding massive drop in price after this type of jump in valuation. Overreaction in one direction leads to overreaction in the opposite direction, a bit like a pendulum. This creates an amazing buying opportunity and I think we are seeing this right now.

The second reason for the low valuation could be that investors have different expectations to analysts. Even though the analysts expect a steady growth in earnings and profits, maybe investors don't see it that that way. Maybe there are some risk factors that analysts are overlooking. That's valid. Looking at Paypal's annual report, we can see a lot of factors that the company identifies. Cybersecurity is a crucial one, increasing competition is another. You also have legislation and compliance risk, you have risk to do with credit, third parties and so on. A lot of these are just regular day-to-day business threats that a financial processing company faces.

The main risk in my eyes is the increasing competition from Google and Apple. However, Paypal has some advantage there because it is mainly a financial company. Google and Apple have other more important business units and I think that Google Pay and Apple Pay are not as important to these companies as their core businesses. In comparison, payments and transactions are Paypal's core business. Cryptocurrency is also a growing risk, but I don't think it poses that big of a threat to Paypal right now. Maybe in 5 years or so. However, Paypal has been active in allowing users to buy, sell and transfer cryptocurrencies. Plus, users can actually use Paypal to pay in crypto although there are improvements that can be made there.

# Conclusion

Overall, I think that **we currently have a good bullish argument for Paypal**. The valuation is really cheap. We are seeing some of the lowest prices since December 2018. Even the company itself has committed to buying back a lot of shares because of the cheap price. In 2022, Paypal bought back $4.2 billion worth of shares or about 80% of their free cash flow. The management has said that they think share buybacks are an excellent way to spend their capital and I agree. They estimate that 75% of the free cash flow in 2023 will go towards share repurchases. In my opinion, this will create bullish pressure for the company. It will reduce the floating stock, it will increase ownership for existing shareholders and it will boost metrics. In terms of target price, the analyst consensus right now is $103.4 dollars or about a 38% upside on the current price of $75. I think that's a reasonable target for the next 12 to 18 months.

What do you think? Is Paypal a good purchase right now? Have I missed any important details about their business?",95,36,TheNewbieInvestor,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12hevdn/a_deep_dive_on_paypal_is_it_a_good_time_to_buy_dd/,12hevdn

# [Stock futures are flat as investors weigh the Fed’s next policy move and await a busy earnings week](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/22/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed Monday as investors weighed a potential slowdown, or pause, from the Federal Reserve and braced for a busy earnings week.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 19 points, or 0.06%. S&amp;P 500 futures inched 0.03% higher, while Nasdaq 100 rose 0.13%.
*****
&gt; On Friday, the major averages rallied to finish the week after briefly losing the momentum of the January rally. The Nasdaq posted a slight gain for the week. However, the Dow and S&amp;P each logged losing own weeks. All of the major averages remain in the green for the month. The Nasdaq is leading the others with a 6.44% year-to-date gain.
*****
&gt; Investors have been weighing the possibility that the Fed is getting ready to slow the pace of its inflation-fighting rate hikes after economic data last week showed a decline in wholesale prices and retail sales.
*****
&gt; On Friday, investors absorbed comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller favoring a quarter percentage point rate increase at the next meeting. A Wall Street Journal report Sunday, meanwhile, raised the possibility of a spring pause to rate increases — a sign that the Fed could be nearing the end of its rate hiking campaign.
*****
&gt; “With investors growing more confident on the inflation side, it is clear they are now looking beyond the current hiking cycle, to an eventual pause and potentially even cuts down the line,” wrote Deutsche Bank strategist Henry Allen in a note to clients Monday. “But with investors now priced for good news on inflation, the risk is that if inflation does prove more persistent, then we could be in another bear market rally just as we saw last summer.”
*****
&gt; Markets have priced in a 99.7% chance of a 25-basis point hike, according to CME Group data, which would bring the interest rate to a targeted range of 4.5%-4.75%.
*****
&gt; No speeches from Fed officials are on the calendar ahead of the central bank policy meeting on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1. Investors, however, will monitor another batch of economic data, including the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditure price index, due out Friday.
*****
&gt; In the meantime, earnings reports could keep the market on edge, with about 40% of the Dow scheduled to release their latest financial results and offer more insight into how companies are weathering inflation and interest rates. Some of the big names on deck include Microsoft, IBM, Tesla, Visa and Mastercard.

On a previous day when the market was acting volatile, I was beating the Indicies when it went down, but again, not as much when it went up.

I look at my portfolio and am puzzled. I own majority of large caps like APPLE, BX, Delta, Visa etc.. plus mid/small caps that have done well. I do relatively decent, but is it really a question of just owning these stocks that go up 10% in a day such as UPST, NVDA etc.. and just deal with it when they go down a lot?

2022-12-18 23:33:48,r/stocks,"Visa, Inc. (V) Stock Review 12/18/22"," 

As always, below represents my opinions and should not be construed as financial advise. Always do you own due dilligence. I welcome your feedback of my opinions.

· **Company Description**

o ELI5 the company’s business model

§ Visa at its core is a payment processor. Visa connects the buyer and seller while a financial partner provides the cash in to facilitate the transaction. These partners are paid the value of rewards (client incentives) to hold in escrow to pay to end users of their cards.

· **Company Soundness**

o How does the company collect revenue? Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?

§ They earn revenue by facilitating payments between customers and merchants, data processing revenues to facilitate clearing and settlement, International transactions allow them to earn fees to enable cross-currency transaction and finally other revenues which is mainly licensing fees. Together, the above makes up gross revenue.

§ Their cards are used daily and are broken down between debit and credit transactions. Credit Cards are typically co-branded and affiliated with a bank (that provides the funds) and a company (which sets the terms of the awards). Debit cards are connected directly with a financial institution and allow you to pay directly from your account without providing your bank account number.

o Do they operate with significant leverage?

§ No, they have $0.65 cents of debt for every $1.00 of equity and operate with an extremely high interest coverage ratio of 36x.

o Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?

§ Yes, while revenues will rise and fall with the economy, there cards will be used continuously. They have access to $950 million of commercial paper with no balance outstanding.

§ Visa also operates with a negative cash conversion cycle. This is in part enabled by collecting fees when they occur but pay rewards over time. This is tracked by capitalizing their rewards and making periodic payments.

· **Can it be Replicated?**

o Is there evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?

§ For sure. There are only 4 players in the credit card market: Visa, MasterCard, AMEX and Discovery. Visa has been in the payment space for over 60 years. Despite technological changes, they continue to remain at the center of the payment industry for reasons will describe below.

o Is there evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?

§ Yes. FCF margins have averaged a staggering 55.5% over the past 5 years, returns on assets over 15% over the past 5 years, steady revenue growth. Their financials are the envy of most of the world.

o What is the competitive advantage?

§ The advantage is to replace Visa, you need to find a method to have customers want to use your new payment system and need to have merchants who accept the payment method. Additionally, Visa wisely pays incentives for using their cards. This adds a further barrier as you would omit a benefit by not using their card. Given their unprecedented scale they can leverage their extremely low operating costs over a massive revenue base enabling these massive margins. A smaller player would not have this level of scale and would need to burn a significant amount of capital to scale. Take new players of late. Venmo was able to get users and replaced sending your friends cash or checks but has had a difficult time being accepted by merchants for fees. Apple and Android pay brought their massive consumer lists to the digital world, but still rely on the cards as they don’t have the merchants nor do the programs offer rewards (outside of credit cards).

§ Additionally, Visa has no fear that it won’t be accepted. You know it is accepted virtually anywhere. Most consumers would not want the headache of a new payment system given the current system works so well.

o Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?

§ I don’t believe so. Their advantage is not so much based on allocating capital for a long time. It’s a brand of trusted secure payments with a well-entrenched network effect.

§ I think it will be extremely difficult for a new player to get merchants, customers and fund an incentive for using their new payment system.

o Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

§ The network effect for payments.

o Are there competitive threats on the horizon?

§ Yes, this history of payments overall is a story not for the faint of heart for most players. New technologies are always trying to enter the mix. Whether its crypto, Venmo or Cash App or whatever other new methods come down the pike there will always be threats to this market.

· **Growth**

o Is there a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?

§ Yes

o Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?

§ Yes, Visa has grown revenues at 10% per year with stable fat margins. Cash still represents 20% of all transactions across the globe. This number will likely continue to dwindle over time giving Visa a nice tailwind to grow in excess of worldwide GDP growth +/- currency changes.

· **Watch List Decision**

o Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision?

§ I believe so.

o Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?

§ I feel it would be extremely difficult to kill.

· **Valuation**

o Value the company

§ Revenue FYE 09/30/22 was $29.310 billion for 2022

§ Revenue is forecast to be $39.451 billion for FYE 25

§ Revenue is forecast to $54.61 billion for FY 28

§ That is a 3-year revenue CAGR of 10.41% from 22 to 25

§ That is a 3-year revenue CAGR of 11.49% from 25 to 28

§ Shares have decreased by 1.5% and 1.9% per year over the past 3 and 5 years respectively. Most of these buybacks accrued with FCF yields of 3%. Since current FCF yield is slightly above this average, I feel it is fair to project that shares decrease a slightly more optimistic range of 1.5% to 2.25% per year.

§ With current shares outstanding of 1.883 billion, this suggests shares outstanding are estimated be 1.75 to 1.80 billion shares on 09/30/25.

§ Current dividend policy is $0.45 per quarter or $1.80 per share. Let’s hold that going forward. Having said that it will likely rise over the next 2 years.

§ Levered FCF margins are fairly stable. Lets assume 50% to 60% and I will use a 10% discount and premium to the estimated revenue with the low and high margins

§ Putting it all together you get a FCF per share of $9.86 to $14.88 on 09/30/25.

§ FCF Yields have averaged 3.2% over the past 5 years. Given the companies entrenchment and some cyclicality and that 3 years after 2025 its current expectations are to maintain a 10+% growth rate, a 3.5% to 4.5% FCF yield is fair in my view.

§ To value the company, I assumed the high FCF per share will be associated with higher yields and lower FCF per share will be paired with lower yield. This gives a range of value per share on 09/30/2025 of $281.79 to $330.64.

§ Currently shares are selling for $207 which implies a 15.6% annual return at the midpoint.

o Would it be a prudent investment to buy the company at current levels?

§ I believe so, a company with the risk characterized in Visa in my view should be selling at a price that would yield the same as the market, call it 10%. That implies a price of $239 per share given my expectations.

§ Given my expectations, Visa seems to be modestly undervalued

2022-12-17 04:21:30,r/stocks,Reflections of Poor Decisions in 2022,"As always, this in not financial advice. This is simply a public reflection of my thoughts on the year as it relates to my portfolio. Due your own due diligence and don’t trust the words of a random stranger on the internet.

This year I will likely end the year with a return -30% to -40%, currently down about 35%. As I have done (not on reddit) for several years now, I like to reflect on the quality of my decisions and the outcomes.

Entering 2022 I had the following holdings: GOOGL, AXP, BRKB, CHE, CHWY, CNSWF, DPZ, HIFS, LMND, MSFT, SPGI, SCI, TMX, TSLA, TOITF, U, YETI

During the year, I made the mistake of moving aggressively into beaten down low-quality tech. Names like U, LMND, PLTR, UPST, DDOG, OKTA, SHOP, TEAM, TOST. In terms of the quality of the decisions I would say that I was that I did not make complete well-rounded decisions. On one hand, I generally applaud myself for buying companies when they are out of favor. These names were down 40 to 60% at the time of purchase. Where I did not do well was look at more than factors other than torrid growth rate and a bright future fed to me on the beautiful pages embedded on their investor presentations (let’s look at that and avoid the skeletons in the 10-Q I said to myself). These companies were bought with too much sunshine and not enough rain.

I should have reviewed additional factors: 

First, how are the financials trending other than growth. Sure, revenue was going up gangbusters, what about margins, or dilution or capital requirements, Revenue/EE, Revenue/Sh etc. As I dug under the hood later in the year most of these companies made no advancement on margins despite torrid revenue growth. I realized not digging this far was very very stupid. 

Additionally, I realized throughout time the competitive landscape has changed and I need to update my assessment as well. Take DataDog. My belief about their competitive positioning was “due to the nature of their mission critical software companies are not likely to leave them due to the high switching costs.” One day I went over my portfolio holding by holding and I realized that I had virtually all software names that had an advantage in my view that stemmed from a switching cost. It kind of hit me this is ridiculous. How can every company have a switching cost advantage? The cloud changed everything. Without the need for servers, it is much easier to simply move from one company to another. Now of course there are still training costs and implementation costs to be sure, but the barriers to create software have never been lower and the number of options has never been higher. 

The realization that switching costs in my opinion is not stringent enough of a definition led me to investigate competitive advantages further. As I do often when I feel I have lost my way in investing, I revisit some legendary texts. This time, I revisited Terry Smith’s Owner’s Manual ([https://www.fundsmith.co.uk/media/mv3abv1h/owners-manual.pdf](https://www.fundsmith.co.uk/media/mv3abv1h/owners-manual.pdf)). In there, he has a section where he speaks about the types of companies they like. Here is what it said:

“We seek to invest in businesses whose assets are intangible and difficult to replicate

It may seem counter-intuitive to seek businesses which do not rely upon tangible assets, but bear with us. The businesses we seek to invest in do something very unusual: they break the rule of mean reversion that states returns must revert to the average as new capital is attracted to business activities earning super-normal returns.

They can do this because their most important assets are not physical assets, which can be replicated by anyone with access to capital, but intangible assets, which can be very difficult to replicate, no matter how much capital a competitor is willing to spend. Moreover, it’s hard for companies to replicate these intangible assets using borrowed funds, as banks tend to favor the (often illusory) comfort of tangible collateral. This means that the business does not suffer from economically irrational (or at least innumerate) competitors when credit is freely available.”

This section gave me an epiphany! To sum it up, businesses with competitive advantages are built in a way that capital alone is unable to reproduce. In other words, there has to be an intangible factor that capital is unable to recreate. I combined this idea with the other questions I typically ask myself.

· **Company Soundness**

o Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?

o Do they operate with significant leverage?

o Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?

· **Can it be Replicated?**

o Is their evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?

o Is their evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?

o What is the competitive advantage?

o Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?

o Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

· **Growth**

o Is their a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?

o Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?

· **Decision**

o Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision?

o Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?

Answering these questions brought down a watchlist of \~75 names to 26.

This filter took names like Amazon off my list. In my opinion, Amazon derives most of its advantage from a long recurring investment in capital. Distribution centers for their retail business and data centers for AWS. Over time as firms have invested in DTC, this has marginalized much of Amazon’s advantage. Additionally, as more cloud players come into the space, the investment in data centers is becoming more common. Ironically, my opinion on Amazon is add odds with Terry Smith given his position in Amazon. As they say, that is what makes a market. Just pull up annual return on assets and you will see one of the reasons why Amazon is plummeting.

Below is my refined list of 26 companies and why I feel capital alone will be able to replicate them sorted alphabetically by name.

Company Ticker Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

Airbnb, Inc. ABNB Network Effect for Airbnb's. Customers want to shop for Airbnb's where the hosts are. Host want to list where the customers are. 

American Express Company AXP Network effect, to upset V you would need to sign up both consumers and vendors all while offering incentives from a significantly smaller scale.

Apple Inc. AAPL Network effects. App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want phones where they can access the services they customarily use. The Duopoly has been attacked by Microsoft and Amazon, yet we still only have two phone systems.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B Reputation. BRK's reputation has a financial powerhouse makes its insurance division one of the few insurers that can be trusted with large and complex risks. Additionally, management unique operating structure allows for very little conglomerate penalty due to the individual management of many businesses.

BlackRock, Inc. BLK Track Record. Launching new financial products is extremely difficult to draw assets without a track record. Given their entrenched history with Blackrock and iShares it will be difficult to upset these funds

Blackstone Inc. BX Track Record. Launching new financial products is extremely difficult to draw assets without a track record. Given their entrenched history across many alternatives it is difficult to select a smaller player.

Constellation Software Inc. CNSW.F  Decentralized operating culture. Management acquires small niche vertically integrated software providers. Their capital allocation is uniquely pushed down to distant levels fromtop management which allows them to scale acquisitions on a decentralized basis. This extremely unique management approach is not something money can buy.

Costco Wholesale Corporation COST Low-Cost Provider. By selling items virtually at cost along with leveraging negotiating powers to drive lowest prices Costco has cemented a foothold in retail. All this value is captured in their annual membership fee.

CRA International, Inc. CRAI Reputation. Within Business consulting, CRAI has a reputation for solving large complex solutions across many industries. When a consultant work with 78 of the fortune 100, you know that paying high fees for results is worth it.

CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD Network Effect. CRWD's cloud-based cybersecurity solutions and massive customer base allows for quick handling of threats. As one threat is dealt with, the solutions are synced through the rest of their cloud-based service. This means helping one client helps all and the more customers the strong the service.

Fair Isaac Corporation FICO Regulatory Entrenchment and track record. The FICO score is synonymous with personal lending. Often it is a key determinant for determining loan eligibility. Given its efficient track record at quantifying risk, newer options will be behind as they don't have the track record.

Hingham Institution for Savings HIFS Culture of Discipline. There are many banks in this world, virtually none of them are as efficient as HIFS. Their disciplined culture toward underwriting leads to lower than industry average charge offs annually while their focus on costs leads to above industry profitability. If you could re-create this with capital, banks with more scale would have similar returns.

IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. IDXX Trade Secrets. IDXX offers many proprietary tests for vets. This means that only IDXX labs can process them. Additionally, many vets are trained on their tests meaning switching would result in the need for new training.

Lemonade, Inc. LMND Potential to be low-Cost provider and culture of customer care. By offering insurance DTC, Lemonade can avoid many entrenched costs from agency model. Additionally, by getting Guinness World Records for fastest claim paid and removing the frustrating part of insurance which is using it, they have the potential to earn pricing power over time

Nu Holdings Ltd. NU Network Effect. In Latin America they are the leading provider of a P2P payment system (like Venmo). They have captured sizeable portions of the populations in Brazil, Mexico and Columbia.

RLI Corp. RLI Disciplined Underwriting culture and unique track record. Their underwriting culture had led to a 10 BPs lower combined ratio and lower ratio every year for the last decade. Money can't buy discipline. They insure a broad spectrum of odd risks. These are both not easily replicated but offer great diversification in their operations.

Rollins, Inc. ROL Low-Cost Provider. As the largest player in most of their markets, Rollin's benefits from major scale advantages. More contracts allow for pest control people to have greater route density during a day and therefore greater profits as well as negotiate better terms on inputs. This is something that a competitor is unable to solve by throwing money at it. Additionally with high brand awareness with Orkin man, they have a step up on smaller lesser-known players.

Roper Technologies, Inc. ROP Decentralized operating culture focused on end markets that benefit from efficient scale. Efficient scale is when an end market is logically only served by one player in a small area, like a freelance truck distributor. If you are looking for a delivery truck, it makes sense that one website would be best for that.

S&amp;P Global Inc. SPGI Regulatory Entrenchment and Track Record. S&amp;Ps credit rating are required by many contracts and regulations for many debt deals. If you need money and your bank requires it, you’re going to pay a hefty fee for their rating. Additionally, they own the IP for the S&amp;P and Dow Jones indexes. These long track records will never be replaced due to their entrenchment and first mover advantage.

Salesforce, Inc. CRM Network effects. App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want to plug in their other products. Salesforce is truly the hub of so many integrated products.

ServiceNow, Inc. NOW Network effects. App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want to plug in their other products. ServiceNow is truly the hub of so many integrated products.

Shopify Inc. SHOP Network effect. For eCommerce players that are looking to compete independently from the likes of Amazon, Shopify is their lifeblood. This means that App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want to plug in their other products. Smaller player and late entries like BigCommerce have struggled to gain traction

Tesla, Inc. TSLA Network effect, Brand, Unique Operating Culture in a tough industry. Network effects stem from outsized number of cars on road all outfitted with self-driving equipment giving Tesla more data to develop self-driving cars giving them a data advantage for developing self-driving cars. Additionally, Tesla is the undisputed electric vehicle king given their first mover advantage. Finally, they operate differently than most of their competitors. They build the important and unique components in house whereas legacy auto tends to outsource all parts and simply assemble them. They sell DTC at retail prices whereas legacy auto sell wholesale to dealers. They have a standard labor force whereas most of legacy auto has unionized labor which is trained on legacy ICE engines. The auto industry is historically difficult to enter as it requires large amounts of capital, high fixed costs with a cyclical product.

Vail Resorts, Inc. MTN You can't re-create the limited supply of mountains in the world. There are so many mountains and locations with the proper weather conditions to enable skiing. This gives them pricing power, particularly when you account for how many mountains they own in many regions.

VeriSign, Inc. VRSN Government granted monopoly. All .com and .net domains must be registered with VRSN. Additionally, price increases are regulated. Fortunately, ROCs are not

Visa Inc. V Network effect, to upset V you would need to sign up both consumers and vendors all while offering incentives from a significantly smaller scale.

From there I reviewed the 26 companies by valuation and felt 15 of them are compelling investments at this time:

Company Ticker Target

Visa Inc. V 10.00%

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B 10.00%

Blackstone Inc. BX 8.00%

American Express Company AXP 8.00%

Salesforce, Inc. CRM 8.00%

Constellation Software Inc. CNSW.F  8.00%

Hingham Institution for Savings HIFS 6.00%

Tesla, Inc. TSLA 6.00%

VeriSign, Inc. VRSN 6.00%

Lemonade, Inc. LMND 5.00%

Nu Holdings Ltd. NU 5.00%

Airbnb, Inc. ABNB 5.00%

Vail Resorts, Inc. MTN 5.00%

Shopify Inc. SHOP 5.00%

CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD 5.00%

I feel much more confident in the portfolio after re-reviewing the soundness, ability to be replicated, future growth prospects. They key for future years is to avoid laziness when analyzing names. It is foolhardy and expensive to fall in love with an investor presentation and then go and buy it on hopes and dreams rather than seeing the larger picture.

The ironic thing is I have owned 14 of the 15 at some point in my life. For one reason or another I got shaken out of them and bought into the temptress that goes by the name of high growth. Like most temptresses, more research reveals not much substance.

For next steps, I will work on integrating the above process into my stock review routine and stick to it. I find that the hardest part with investing is simply sticking to a practical approach. Its too easy to waver to something new. Variety is the spice of life, but makes for the taste of cocoa powder in investments.

Obviously, these are just my opinions. I welcome your feedback.",40,15,rifleman209,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/znww2s/reflections_of_poor_decisions_in_2022/,znww2s

What's the general rule of thumb for finding and holding stocks to everyone? Or if you have certain criteria, i.e. buying a volume of penny stocks and selling them when they hit X price, waiting for the IPO stock that crashed to hit big in however long you want to wait and then sell off the profit and throw in blue chips?

2022-10-26 15:43:39,r/stocks,Visa earnings and revenue beats estimates. Dividend increased by 20%,"The company reported net income of $3.94 billion, or $1.86 a share, compared with $3.58 billion, or $1.65 a share, in the year-earlier period.

Payments volume at Visa V, 2.39% grew 10% in the fiscal fourth quarter, while processed transactions increased 12%. Visa’s revenue rose to $7.79 billion from $6.56 billion and came in ahead of the FactSet consensus, which was for $7.55 billion.

Prabhu noted on the earnings call that Visa was” moderating expense growth” as it starts its new fiscal year, “so expense growth is clearly coming down from the levels you’ve seen.”

The company noted in its release that during October, its board of directors approved a new $12 billion stock-buyback program as well as an increase to the dividend. The quarterly cash dividend will be 45 cents a share, up from 38 cents prior, payable on Dec. 1 to shareholders of record as of Nov. 11.

2022-10-23 22:12:40,r/stocks,Economic News and notable earnings for next week,"  

Economic Data

Tuesday: 

The Commerce Department releases its report on August sales of new homes in the U.S. New-home sales fell 12.6% in July compared with June.

The Conference Board publishes its September consumer-confidence index, which measures U.S. attitudes toward jobs and the economy. Consumer confidence improved in August after falling for three consecutive months.

Wednesday

The National Association of Realtors reports the number of home sales based on contract signings in August. Pending home sales declined in July for the second consecutive month as high mortgage rates and elevated home prices diminished demand.

Thursday

The Commerce Department publishes a third estimate of second-quarter gross domestic product—a broad measure of the goods and services produced in an economy—after its second estimate showed that the decline in U.S. economic output during that time was less severe than initially estimated. The second estimate showed that the economy contracted at a 0.6% annual rate in the April-through-June period, a slower pace than the 0.9% decline initially estimated, driven in part by an upward revision of consumer spending.

China’s National Bureau of Statistics and S&amp;P Global release September surveys of purchasing managers about economic activity in China’s manufacturing sector. China’s agency also releases a separate survey measuring the country’s nonmanufacturing sector.  

Friday

The European Union’s statistics agency releases September inflation figures for the 19-nation eurozone. The bloc’s consumer prices were 9.1% higher in August than the same month a year earlier, the fastest pace since records began in early 1997.

The University of Michigan publishes its final reading of consumer sentiment for September. Its initial estimate earlier in the month showed it had ticked up from August’s final reading.

2022-10-07 13:54:53,r/stocks,Visa partners with FTX in a bet that shoppers still want to spend cryptocurrencies in a bear market,"&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Even as prices have plummeted this year, crypto investors still want to spend their digital currencies.

&amp;#x200B;

The payments giant is partnering with global exchange FTX to offer debit cards in 40 countries, with a focus on Latin America, Asia and Europe. The cards, which are already available in the U.S., will be linked directly to users' FTX cryptocurrency investment accounts. According to Visa's chief financial officer, the move allows customers to use digital currencies without transferring them from exchanges ""just as they would with any bank account.

&amp;#x200B;

""There is a steady interest in cryptocurrencies even though the value has gone down,"" Visa CFO Vasant Prabhu told CNBC in a phone interview. ""As a company, we don't have a position on what the value of cryptocurrency should be, or whether it's a good thing in the long run - as long as people have something they want to buy, we want to facilitate it.""

&amp;#x200B;

It's Visa is the latest attempt in the space, and has added more than 70 crypto partnerships. The San Francisco-based company has joined forces with FTX rivals Coinbase and Binance. Rival MasterCard has been working on similar partnerships and has also partnered with Coinbase on NFT and Bakkt, allowing banks and merchants in its network to offer crypto-related services. American Express has said it is exploring tying its cards and network to stablecoins that are tied to the price of a dollar. But the CEO said earlier this year that consumers should not expect to see American Express cards tied to cryptocurrencies ""anytime soon.

&amp;#x200B;

""We definitely see this as a technology that is disrupting traditional payment networks,"" FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried told CNBC by phone. ""As a traditional payments company, you have to make a decision: Are you going to rely on it or are you going to fight it? fight it? I respect the fact that many of them are inclined to do that.""

&amp;#x200B;

Visa's Prabhu points to the demand for stablecoins that are either pegged to the price of a dollar or another fiat currency. The CFO said they often see .",48,21,tang4685,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xxx5ec/visa_partners_with_ftx_in_a_bet_that_shoppers/,xxx5ec
2022-10-03 11:15:57,r/stocks,"Building Better Inflation Indices using E-Commerce, Payment Gateway, &amp; Other Tech Company Data","I was reading this [post](https://www.man.com/maninstitute/inflation-what-the-academic-research-says) by the Man Institute and realized that there are companies in certain kind of business that can help the government &amp; policy makers help build real-time inflation indices, which in turn would help the government &amp; policy makers make decisions that benefit the people that actually require them. The companies can - 

1. Make this real - time data available publicly so that there is transparency and users do not feel like their data is being exploited
2. Data can be anonymous and not on an individual basis, and can be aggregated to show which products &amp; services are purchased by the majority and which products &amp; services are basic necessities versus luxury products &amp; services

Examples - 

* Consider an example where majority of the people purchase groceries from Amazon, and the prices of which have increased 100%. Now the government &amp; policy makers can further analyze if this increase in groceries is due to increase in cost of seeds or an increase in cost of fertilizers or an increase in cost of fuel for transport or probably an increase in all of them. After they have determined the causes for higher prices, they can work on mitigating the causes through lower taxes, or some kind of subsidy, or working on different sourcing contracts.

1. E-Commerce companies - such as Amazon has data on the goods &amp; services that people purchase. It can use this data to actually show how the purchasing power of customers is affected in real time and using the kind of goods &amp; services that are purchased. The reason for their increase in prices can also be determined. If the root cause of inflation can be determined and how it hurts specific goods then the government &amp; policy makers can take appropriate actions. 
2. Payment Gateway companies - such as Mastercard &amp; Visa can do the same thing as Amazon which has been described above.
3. Real Estate Aggregators - such as Zillow can give out rental and sales data which can be used as described above.
4. Companies such as Google and Facebook may not be able to provide accurate data as the above 3, because the above 3 are final purchases whereas Google and Facebook might be used to search for options or browse through the available options.

**Note - the above was just a thought and I immediately posted it here. I obviously haven't thought about it thoroughly, and your opinions, ideas, and criticisms are more than welcome, Cheers!**",12,10,ThreeD710,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xued16/building_better_inflation_indices_using_ecommerce/,xued16
2022-09-30 02:07:37,r/stocks,FCF Yield of Stocks I am Watching,"I recently compiled a list of stocks with their free cash flow (FCF) yield to see how good or bad that investment might be compared to a **2 year treasury bond (which is currently yielding \~4.2%)**. The yield was calculated using the enterprise value (EV) of the company since a lot of the companies carry a high debt load (think about AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Comcast for example). 

**Here is the equation for FCF yield of a company/stock that I used: FCF(ttm)/EV and FCF(5 yrs avg)/EV.** So basically I looked at the trailing 12 months (ttm) free cash flows and last 5 years average free cash flows as well. The data was taken from Yahoo Finance app and approximate. If you like any of the stocks based on their FCF yield, definitely do additional research to verify /cross check the numbers (some of the data might be inaccurate because of human error ).

2022-09-06 08:43:40,r/stocks,"Al Gore’s Firm Made Big Bets on Microsoft, Shopify Stock","Al Gore’s investment firm recently made some big changes in its stock investments. Generation Investment Management, which the former vice president co-founded and chairs, dramatically increased investments in software giant Microsoft (ticker: MSFT) and e-commerce provider Shopify (SHOP), initiated an investment in card giant Mastercard (MA), and exited a position in rival Visa (V). The stock trades, among others, were disclosed in a form Generation filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the second quarter.

Generation, a London-based firm focused on sustainable and environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, declined to comment. It had more than $36 billion of assets under management as of March 31. The firm bought 3.7 million Microsoft shares to end the second quarter with 4.2 million shares. Microsoft stock slipped 24% in the first half of the year, compared with a 21% drop in the S&amp;P 500 index. So far in the third quarter, shares are unchanged compared with a 3.7% rise in the index. Microsoft has been cutting back on employee expenses by curbing business travel and company gatherings. Consumers have been spending less on videogames in recent months, which may be an issue for the company, which is in the process of acquiring game publisher Activision Blizzard (ATVI). Microsoft’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, reported in July, showed its slowest earnings growth in two years.

Shopify’s second-quarter report, from July, also disappointed, and revenue growth was hurt by a stronger dollar. Right before the report, Shopify announced the layoff of 1,000 workers, about 10% of its global workforce, as online shopping faded when consumers went back to stores. Meanwhile, Shopfiy CEO Tobe Lutke has been buying shares of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, which he serves as a director. Shopify stock plunged 77% in the first half of the year, and so far in the third quarter shares are down 3.6%. Generation bought 7.4 million Shopify shares in the second quarter to raise its investment to 7.5 million shares.

The firm bought two million Mastercard shares in the second quarter. It hadn’t owned any at the end of the first quarter. Mastercard stock slipped 12% in the first half of the year, and so far in the third quarter, shares are up 2.2%. Mastercard’s second-quarter earnings, reported near the end of July, were strong, as were earnings by rival Visa. Both companies are betting cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin will one day be used widely and routinely for typical purchases. There is also a bill circulating that could shake up the giant credit-card networks of Mastercard and Visa. Speaking of Visa, Generation sold all of its 3.2 million shares in the second quarter. Visa stock slipped 9% in the first half of the year, and so far in the third quarter, shares are flat.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 5th, 2022.

# **Major stock averages slide for third week, Nasdaq posts six-day losing streak - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/01/stock-futures-are-flat-ahead-of-key-august-jobs-report-due-friday.html)**
*****
&gt; U.S. equities fell on Friday to cap their third straight weekly decline, after a solid August jobs report failed to ease fears that the Federal Reserve would keep aggressively hiking interest rates to fight inflation.
*****
&gt; After rallying through the morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average erased a 370-point gain and finished the session lower by 337.98 points, or about 1.1%, at 31,318.44. The S&amp;P 500 fell roughly 1.1% to 3,924.26, its lowest close since July. The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.3% to 11,630.86, recording its first six-day losing streak since 2019.
*****
&gt; All of the major averages were lower to end the week, making it their third negative week in a row after slumping in the final days of August. The Dow and S&amp;P lost roughly 3% and 3.3%, respectively, while the Nasdaq fell 4.2%.
*****
&gt; “There’s still a lot of nervousness around what we’ll see over the next few months,” said Callie Cox, U.S. investment analyst at eToro. “Yes, inflation and the job market are coming back into balance, but at what cost? Markets are still figuring that out.”
*****
&gt; “To make matters worse, the S&amp;P 500 is trapped in the danger zone – below its three big moving averages,” she added. “Those moving averages served as floors up until a few weeks ago. Now, they seem to be ceilings that the index just can’t bust through. The mood has definitely changed. While we may not test the lows of this sell-off again, we also may not reach new highs any time soon.”
*****
&gt; Stocks had been weighed down throughout this week by hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials signaling that interest rate hikes aren’t going away anytime soon. That’s put traders on watch for a retest of the June lows, especially knowing September is historically a poor month for the market. Some have suggested that if the S&amp;P 500 fails to hold the 3,900 level, those summer lows could come back into play.
*****
&gt; Some investors were briefly comforted on Friday by the highly anticipated jobs report, which showed the economy added 315,000 jobs for the month, just under the Dow Jones estimate for 318,000. Stocks rallied in the first part of the day.
*****
&gt; The unemployment rate rose to 3.7%, two-tenths of a percentage point higher than expectations. The August report is particularly important because it’s one of the last major economic reports the Fed will weigh before it raises rates at its September meeting. This data point could help the central bank determine whether a 75-basis-point hike.
*****
&gt; The last major economic report of note is August CPI on Sept. 13 and is more likely to determine how aggressive the Fed needs to be in the near term.

&gt; # Weakness on Tuesday After Labor Day – DJIA and S&amp;P 500 Down Five Straight

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/cc7cc8409c0c340cadf9a7b61cfc41ee/1e21b309f0b8c0aa-bc/s500x750/2bdde9987f231ac50cf4d87e13c9fde88f4e9cc4.jpg))**

&gt; In the last 21 years, only Russell 2000 has registered an average gain of 0.03% on the Tuesday after the long Labor Day weekend. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have struggled with negative average performance. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 all have fallen for the last five years on Tuesday. On Wednesday the market’s performance has been varied. DJIA has performed the best, up 71.4% of the time with an average gain of 0.30%. S&amp;P 500 is weakest, up only 47.6% of the time with an average gain of 0.29%. NASDAQ has a better record up 52.4% of the time on Wednesday, but a smaller average gain of 0.26%.

&gt; # Bears Back Above 50%

&gt; In the wake of Jackson Hole and more hawkish than previously expected Fedspeak, the S&amp;P 500 is on pace for its worst week since June. As a result, recent improvements in investor optimism have been entirely given back. The AAII survey of individual investors saw only 21.9% of respondents report as bullish this week. That is the worst reading in two months as the back-to-back declines over the past two weeks total 11.4 percentage points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Sentiment-1.png))**

&gt; That was matched with a considerable increase in bearish responses. For the first time since early July, over half of respondents reported a pessimistic outlook for equities. Bearish sentiment's eight percentage point week-over-week increase was the largest since mid-June and the third weekly increase in a row.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Sentiment-2.png))**

&gt; The inverse moves of bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bull-bear spread to quickly move down to the worst level since the start of July. That follows a string of readings only a couple of weeks ago in which bears outnumbered bulls by only single digits.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Sentiment-3.png))**

&gt; Given the reversal in the spread, the streak of negative readings presses on. Now at 22 weeks long, it ties the 1990 streak for the second longest on record.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Sentiment-5.png))**

&gt; The AAII survey was not alone in showcasing a much more pessimistic tone of investors. Both the NAAIM Exposure Index and the Investors Intelligence survey also pivoted to more bearish readings. Combining these three results, the average reading on sentiment has fallen back to more than one standard deviation below the historical norm. Although that is not as pessimistic of an aggregate sentiment reading as earlier this year, there have only been a handful of other times going back to the mid-2000s in which the investment community had as negative of an outlook towards the equity market.

&gt; # August Declines All Around the World

&gt; The end of August is here and US equities, as measured by the S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY), have been on a wild ride. At the mid-month high, SPY was sitting on a 4.3% month-to-date gain, but that has more than entirely been erased as it is on pace to finish the month down closer to 3.5%. The country ETF of each other major global economy that we track in our Global Macro Dashboard is a similar story. Across these countries, on average, they had reached a 3.13% gain at their month-to-date highs, but today they are down an average of 3.5% MTD. Overall, developed markets have faired much worse than emerging market countries with average declines of 4.82% versus 1.24%, respectively. In fact, there are only two ETFs—Brazil (EWZ) and India (INDA)—that are currently positive for the month. Meanwhile, China (MCHI) is unchanged. On the other end of the spectrum, Sweden (EWD) has been the worst performer nearing an 11% decline with a number of other European nations following up with the next worst performance.

&gt; With stock markets around the world giving up the ghost in August, most have moved back below their 50-DMAs or even into oversold territory. There are no country ETFs more than one standard deviation above their moving averages although EWZ and INDA have only moved out of overbought territory in the past week.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/083122-GMD-1.png))**

&gt; As we show in the table above, this year's declines have resulted in the average country ETF falling 24% below its 52-week high. Those declines bring the vast majority of these countries back below pre-COVID highs as well. At the moment, there are only four countries that remain above pre-COVID 52-week highs: Taiwan (EWT), India (INDA), the United States (SPY), and Canada (EWC). This exclusive group would need to fall substantially further to revert back to those prior highs, and as shown in the chart below, each one would also still have support at lows from earlier this year before pre-COVID highs become a technical level worth eying.

&gt; # High Correlation Between Stocks and Bonds

&gt; So far in 2022, stocks and bonds have both sold off, leading investors with a balanced portfolio to experience historically painful drawdowns. Rates have risen, and partially because of this fact, equities have had a tough year. The S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) is down 16.0% on a YTD basis, while the iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) has shed 11.3% of its value. Typically, rates fall alongside equities, as investors shift their capital allocations to safer assets. 2022 has been different, though, and has seen selling in both bonds and equities. This has resulted in a historic level of positive correlation between the ETFs SPY and AGG going back to 2004 when AGG first started trading. Click here to start a two-week trial to Bespoke Premium and receive our paid content in real-time.

&gt; Although the 200-day correlation between stocks (SPY) and bonds (AGG) has been higher once before (in late 2009), the current level remains particularly elevated. The current 200-day correlation sits at 0.87, which signifies a strong positive relationship. In the last 200 days, stocks have moved in the opposite direction of rates on most days, as the market is incredibly focused on the bond market as the Fed transitions from an accommodative to a restrictive stance in the face of higher inflation. Interestingly, the correlation coefficient does appear to be rolling over, moving lower in each of the last 15 trading sessions. Historically speaking, the correlation coefficient has tended to turn negative not long after rolling over, as illustrated by the chart below.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/Stocks-and-Bonds-200-D-083022-2.png))**

&gt; The more we zoom in, the more the rollover becomes clear. The higher frequency measures, such as the 100 and 50-day correlation coefficients, have already moved substantially off of their recent highs, even though they are still elevated relative to history. The 100-day correlation coefficient is now at just 0.70, while the 50-day coefficient is even lower at 0.55, the lowest levels since mid-June and mid-May, respectively. This tells us that the 200-day correlation will likely pull back further, thus giving SPY a chance to gain even as rates rise, and visa-versa. As evidence of this, today SPY is down over 125 basis points even as AGG is up six bps, moving in opposite directions. To make a long story short, bonds and stocks may begin to diverge in terms of performance as the correlation between the two assets begins to roll over. Now you just have to figure out which direction they'll each go!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/08/Stocks-and-Bonds-50-D-083022-2.png))**

&gt; The rolling 100-day correlation between stocks and bonds has been over 0.5 (or 50%) for 129 trading days, which is the longest streak since the inception of AGG by a considerable margin. Although the coefficient is declining, the 100-day correlation would need to drop another 0.2 points for this streak to end.

&gt; # Continuing Claims Catching Up

&gt; Initial jobless claims had a strong showing this week as the previous reading was revised lower by 6K to 237K. From that revised level, claims fell another 5K down to 232K marking the lowest reading since the last week of June. That was also handily below expectations which were calling for an increase up to 248K. With another week over week decline, claims have now fallen for three weeks in a row; the longest streak of declines since February.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted (NSA) basis, the current week of the year has historically marked the annual low. Assuming that is the case this year, 176.8K is in line with the readings from the comparable week of the year in 2018 and 2019. Although further declines are not out of the realm of possibility, assuming normal seasonal patterns, NSA claims will likely rise from here through the end of the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; Continuing claims are lagged an additional week to initial claims.. While continuing claims remain low having avoided the same degree of upward drift that initial claims have experienced this year, this week's reading did move up to 1.438 million. That marks the most elevated level since the first week of April.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/090122-Claims-3.png))**

&gt; Recently we have been highlighting the ratio of initial claims to continuing claims as a way of showing the disconnect between the two seasonally adjusted readings. In other words, the lack of filter through of initial claims into continuing claims, which can be extrapolated as those filing for unemployment are quickly finding new roles. Although the ratio remains well above the historical norm and especially the range of readings observed since the early 1990s, it has begun to roll over in the past five weeks. As for just how big of a drop it has been, the decline ranks in the bottom 2% of all 5-week moves on record. While that is not to say the overall claims picture (initial claims not turning into continuing claims) has completely turned around, it is a sign that continuing claims have been playing a degree of catch-up.

Text:

An expected bill would give merchants power to choose different network when they receive many Visa and Mastercard credit cards
Two U.S. senators are preparing legislation that would give merchants power to process many Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. credit cards over different networks.

The bill, which could be introduced as soon as this week, aims to create more competition among U.S. credit-card networks, a sector where Visa and Mastercard have long dominated. Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, and Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, are expected to introduce the bill.

Mr. Marshall said banks and major card networks lobbied his office to not sign onto the bill. He decided to move forward after hearing from a growing number of merchants, including small businesses, restaurants, gas stations and convenience stores, about the toll of the rising credit-card fees set by Visa and Mastercard that are often pocketed by large banks.
Mr. Durbin spearheaded a similar rule for debit cards over a decade ago. The Durbin amendment, part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, requires that merchants have the ability to choose from at least two unaffiliated debit-card networks when routing transactions.

Most shoppers don’t think twice about how their payments are processed when they buy something with a credit card. But the underlying plumbing and its associated fees represent a fierce source of contention between merchants that pay the fees and big card networks and banks that set or collect them. The expected bill reflects a growing scrutiny of the payments sector.

Once the bill is introduced, the Senate parliamentarian would decide which committee it goes through, according to people familiar with the matter. Because the bill would amend the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, it would likely be referred to the Senate Banking Committee, the people said. Neither Mr. Durbin nor Mr. Marshall is on the banking committee.

Rep. Peter Welch of Vermont plans to be the lead Democrat on a House bill, according to a person familiar with the matter. It couldn’t be determined if a House bill would have a Republican co-lead and if it would get introduced without one. 
Most U.S. banks that issue credit cards pair up with one of the two major networks, Visa or Mastercard. The network is typically listed on the front or back of the card. When a person uses a credit card at, say, a department store, the store has to pay card-related fees, including a so-called interchange fee to the card issuer and a network fee to Visa or Mastercard.
The networks set these fees and say they are important because they help cover costs for things like innovation and preventing fraud. Credit cards can also encourage consumers to buy more, networks say. 

Representatives for Visa, Mastercard and the Electronic Payments Coalition, which represents card issuers and networks, didn’t immediately have a comment. 

When a consumer pays with a credit card that has Visa or Mastercard listed on it, merchants generally have to route the payment through that network.
The bill would mandate that merchants in many cases have the right to route payments through an unaffiliated network. This would apply on Visa or Mastercard credit cards that are issued by banks with more than $100 billion in assets. 
The Merchants Payments Coalition, which represents merchant trade groups and lobbied for the bill, says merchants should have the choice to send credit-card payments over networks that set lower fees.
Visa and Mastercard handled roughly 77% of all general-purpose credit-card spending last year that occurred on cards issued in the U.S., according to the Nilson Report, a trade publication.",115,16,LookAtThatBacon,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/w9kqyy/senate_bill_takes_aim_at_visa_mastercard/,w9kqyy
2022-07-26 23:07:05,r/stocks,Can someone explain to me in non-legal mambo jumbo the implications of a company putting aside money for class actions?,"Who can explain to me how a company pays for putting aside money for possible class action litigation?
If it is share related what effect does it have on the overall number of shares?
Why does a company needs to do so (is it government mandated or is it just to cover their butt)?  Visa called it retrospective responsibility plan.
How is this amount determined?  

This is what I found and I can’t understand it. 

Conversion feature. Under the terms of the plan, when the Company funds the escrow account, the shares of class B common stock are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. This has the same effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company’s class A common stock, by reducing the as-converted class B common stock share count.

If you are thinking about starting a position in any of the stocks, my recommendation is to not do so before these prices.  You should index instead. This is concerning investing for &gt;5 years not trading.  These are not necessarily the bottom but more reasonable entry points.  It will be a slinky down the stairs type route to these prices. (to clarify as there appears to be some confusion from the comments, the cheat sheet is not an indicator to buy or not buy at or below the prices listed, the cheat sheet merely suggests that the indices are preferable to the listed stocks until the prices are met according to the analysis done to construct the cheat sheet, ie it is not a stock recommendation list)

Visa and Mastercard both trade around a 33 PE and above a 15 Price to Sales. This is brutal to me and seems all the dominance is priced in or just trading at an overvaluation. AXP trades at a 16 PE and around a 2 Price to Sales.

AMEX is right there with MA as far as the market share and they issue their own cards unlike MA. I know they are dominant in their space and create a crazy amount of money but the valuation seems brutal.

“Visa Inc. topped $7 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, buoyed by a quicker-than-expected resumption in travel spending and sustained growth in categories like e-commerce that had been strong throughout the pandemic.

The company generated fiscal first-quarter net income of $4.0 billion, or $1.83 a share, up from $3.1 billion, or $1.42 a share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, Visa V earned $1.81 a share. Analysts tracked by FactSet were expecting $1.70 in both GAAP and adjusted earnings per share.

Visa’s revenue rose to $7.06 billion from $5.69 billion, while the FactSet consensus was for $6.79 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet weren’t expecting Visa to cross the $7 billion revenue mark until the June quarter.

Payments volume rose 20%, while processed transactions increased 21%. The company saw a 51% increase in cross-border volume when excluding intra-Europe transactions and a 40% bump in overall cross-border volume.”",126,15,randomaccount0923,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/se9ktg/visa_stock_gains_as_quarterly_revenue_tops_7/,se9ktg
2022-01-27 14:33:37,r/stocks,Big Companies will go shopping on this Dip.,"This big drop in stock prices in tech is going to be very good for the big profitable companies.  I think we will see a slew of acquisitions over the next couple of months as a lot of the tech stocks are down 50% or more.  MSFT won’t be the only company taking advantage of cheaper prices to make big moves.  There are several sectors that we will see huge consolidation in my opinion:

Semi-Conductors:

Nvidia deal to buy ARM is going to be cancelled.  That will give them money to target a different company that will not face so many regulation issues.  Other electronic makers want to be like Apple and start supplying their own chips.  Target companies:


HIMX - My top pick.  Crazy undervalued with only a 6 PE and being a Taiwanese company they could easily be bought.  I could see Samsung (current customer) or other big tech.  The bigger company of Taiwan Semi-conductor might make a move too since they already have a huge market share and it makes the most sense.  


Synaptic Inc (SYNA) - 62 PE so still expensive but down 35% from its height.


Cadence (CDNS) - High PE of 57 but gaining market share every month.  Crush earnings every quarter.


There are other private chip manufactures that could easily be purchased as well.

Fintech Companies are going to consolidate.  The big companies like PayPal, Block (Square), and even Apple wants to get into the payment service and they all have plenty of money to spend.  Possible targets:

Upstart (UPST) - Down by 75% from its high.  They can still get a nice premium for their company if they sell soon.

Affirm (AFRM) - BNPL is big still and they already have contracts with Amazon, Apple, and Shopify.  I wouldn’t be surprised if they get bought by one of these three.

SOFI - Still expensive but now with the bank charter approved it could be tempting for a huge firm like Goldman or big payment companies like Visa. I know some people think this couldn’t happen but a 500B market cap company could easily buy a 10B market cap company.

HOOD - They are getting beat up so its an opportunity to buy a lot of customers for a pretty cheap price from the bigger brokerages.  Again, Goldman, Schwab, etc….

I also think the insurance industry is going to consolidate as well.  I wouldn’t be surprised to see LMND get bought or even ROOT.",40,31,Phx-Jay,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sdyi3i/big_companies_will_go_shopping_on_this_dip/,sdyi3i

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, January 24, 2022**

What an action-packed day! After dropping steeply in the morning, stocks reversed sharply higher to close the day in the green as market participants look ahead to a busy week of earnings and new commentary by the Federal Reserve. 

**Markets Today (low of the day to closing price)**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -3.72% to +0.42%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -4.75% to +0.46%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -3.03% to +0.43%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -2.72% to +2.30%
* Volatility Index (VIX):  +18.71% to 2.24%
* NVIDIA (NVDA): -10.31% to -0.01%
* Tesla (TSLA): -9.21% to -1.47%
* Apple (AAPL): -4.58% to -0.49%
* Shopify (SHOP): -11.45% to +6.39%
* Goldman Sachs (GS): -4.82% to -0.15%

This year has not been kind to stocks so far, with expectations for tighter monetary conditions by the Federal Reserve causing the 10-year Treasury yield to spike to spike to its highest level in two years, sparking volatility in technology and growth stocks which greatly benefited from easy financial conditions since 2022. With inflation persisting at a higher level than originally expected, members of the Fed are now calling for three to four interest rate hikes next year, with the earliest projected for March 2022. 

On Wednesday, the Fed is set to have its January monetary policy meeting and press conference by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, which is expected to produce no changes to existing policy. However, as the Fed looks in to rein rising inflation, the meeting will likely set the stage for the Fed to indicate the potential timeline for an interest rate hike. 

Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a note to clients “Until we get a further selloff in risk assets, the Fed will simply not be convinced that raising interest rates and reducing the size of its balance sheet in 2022 will more likely cause a recession rather than a soft landing. Either outcome would dampen inflation, of course, which is why 10-year Treasury yields have stopped climbing. But only a soft landing would allow public companies to continue to post strong earnings. The risk of a hard landing is why U.S. large caps are under so much stress.""

As of the start of the week, only about 13% of S&amp;P 500 companies had reported quarterly results, according to Goldman Sachs. And so far, one trend that has begun to emerge has been relatively weak commentary about the outlook for this year. 

David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, said “Investors are very interested in forward-looking guidance from management, and recent information on that front has been concerning. Bank executives emphasized higher operating costs in the coming year. Following the release of 4Q results, only six companies in the S&amp;P 500 provided formal near-term guidance for 1Q 2022. Unfortunately, five of the six firms guided below consensus for next quarter, including three of the stocks that actually beat expectations in Q4."" 

Looking ahead, a number of large-cap stocks are set to report earnings results this week, offering investors a view into how companies are holding up amid surging Omicron cases, rising inflation, and a tight labor market. Here are some of the earnings I will be paying close attention to:

**Tuesday:** Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), American Express (AXP), Microsoft (MSFT), Capital One (COF), Texas Instruments (TXN)

**Wednesday:** Boeing (BA), Abbott (ABT), Tesla (TSLA), Intel (INTC), Lam Research (LRCX), Las Vegas Sands (LVS), ServiceNow (NOW)

**Thursday:** Mastercard (MA), McDonald’s (MCD), Apple (AAPL), Robinhood (HOOD), Visa (V), Western Digital (WDC), Atlassian (TEAM), Valero (VLO)

**Friday:** Chevron (CVX), Caterpillar (CAT), Weyerhaeuser (WY)

**Highlights**

* IHS Markit's preliminary January services purchasing managers index (PMI) slid to 50.9 from December's 57.6. This marked the lowest level in about 18 months. Readings above the neutral level of 50.0 indicate expansion in a sector. Meanwhile, the institution's manufacturing PMI also fell in January to a 15-month low, reaching 55.0 compared to December's 57.7.
* AT&amp;T (T) is reportedly rolling out the fastest consumer broadband offered by major internet providers
* Tesla Inc on Monday fought back against JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co over a disputed bond contract, countersuing the bank for seeking a ""windfall"" following Elon Musk's notorious 2018 tweet that he might take his electric car company private. In a filing in Manhattan federal court, Tesla accused JPMorgan of ""bad faith and avarice"" for demanding $162.2 million after the bank had unilaterally changed the terms of warrants it received when Tesla sold convertible bonds in 2014.
* Meta Platforms (FB) said on Monday that its research team has built a new artificial intelligence supercomputer that it thinks will be the fastest in the world when completed in mid-2022.
* Texas and the District of Columbia sued Alphabet Inc's Google on Monday over what he called deceptive location tracking practices that invade users’ privacy.
* Luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz is teaming up with self-driving sensor maker Luminar Technologies Inc. (LAZR) to pursue fully-automated driving 
* China cut its one-year loan prime rate by 10 basis points. The home mortgage rate was also cut by 5 basis points. Following the lending rate cuts, shares of U.S.-listed Chinese tech companies traded mostly higher in Hong Kong on Thursday, lifting the benchmark Hang Seng Index to its highest level in almost two months

On Monday morning, Amazon started sending affected customers emails telling them they would be able to continue to use their Visa credit cards to pay for items, and for Amazon Prime.

“The expected change regarding the use of Visa credit cards on Amazon.co.uk will no longer take place on 19 January. We are working closely with Visa on a potential solution that will enable customers to continue using their Visa credit cards on Amazon.co.uk,” the email stated.

“Should we make any changes related to Visa credit cards, we will give you advance notice. Until then, you can continue to use Visa credit cards, debit cards, Mastercard, American Express, and Eurocard as you do today.”

Almost 90% of Britons shop at Amazon, and its analysts have estimated Amazon Prime membership in the UK to be about 21 million. Last month, it was claimed that Amazon faced losing nearly £1.4bn from UK shoppers had Visa credit cards been banned from the site.

A Visa spokesperson said: “Amazon customers can continue to use Visa cards on Amazon.co.uk after January 19 while we work closely together to reach an agreement.”

**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, January 11, 2022**

After one of the wildest days I’ve experienced in the market, stocks carried on yesterday’s momentum, with all three major indexes advancing as market participants digested new testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. 

**Markets Today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +0.91%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +1.52%
* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.50%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +1.05%
* Volatility Index (VIX): -5.05%
* Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): +4.02%
* Sea Limited (SE): +6.01%
* Albertsons (ACI): -9.56%
* Virgin Orbit (VORB): +27.83%
* Shake Shack (SHAK): +12.14%
* Amazon (AMZN): +2.40%

During his confirmation hearing before Congress, Powell said the US economy was healthy enough to support a reduction in the accommodative monetary policy that has propped up the markets for the last two years. This means putting an end to quantitative easing and raising the interest rate.

He said, “As we move through this year … if things develop as expected, we’ll be normalizing policy, meaning we’re going to end our asset purchases in March, meaning we’ll be raising rates over the course of the year. At some point perhaps later this year we will start to allow the balance sheet to run off, and that’s just the road to normalizing policy.”

Powell reiterated that the Central Bank was prepared to act if the pace of inflation does not begin to moderate in the coming months. He said, “If we see inflation persisting at high levels, longer than expected, if we have to raise interest rates more over time, then we will.”

Powell said the moves are in response to an economy with a strong labor market, with an unemployment rate of 3.9% in December, but elevated inflation. Powell said, “What that \[the unemployment rate coupled with elevated inflation\] is really telling us is that the economy no longer needs or wants the very highly accommodative policies that we’ve had in place to deal with the pandemic and its aftermath. We’re really just going to be moving over the course of this year to a policy that is closer to normal. But it’s a long road to normal from where we are.”

The Fed’s most potent tool remains interest rates, which the central bank has pinned to zero since the depths of the pandemic. Raising interest rates could address higher demand by making it more expensive to borrow. However, higher borrowing costs would not do much to address supply-side constraints and shipping bottlenecks that are greatly contributing to the rise in prices. Powell said, “We can affect the demand side, we can’t affect the supply side. But this really is a combination of the two.”

Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield, which reached a yearly higher at 1.8% yesterday, came down after Powell’s speech, hovering at 1.741% at the time of writing. 

Steven Wieting, Global Chief Investment Strategist at Citigroup, said “We’re seeing across the board a re-rating of what the Federal Reserve will do. The likelihood is very clear that the Fed will succeed in sinking inflation. That is going to happen one way or the other and we are just trying to gather how actively the Fed will be doing that.”

Regarding interest rate hikes, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he sees the Fed passing four rate hikes next year, one more than the currently telegraphed three. Speaking to CNBC, Dimon said, ""It's possible that inflation is worse than people think. I, personally, would be surprised if it's just four increases this year. Four would be very easy for the economy to absorb.""

Looking ahead, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release December’s Consumer Price Index Friday, which is currently expected to show a 7.0% jump in year-over-year prices, the largest jump since 1982. This could also spark more volatility. 

Moreover, at the end of the week, big financial institutions, including JP Morgan (JPM), Blackrock (BLK), Citigroup, and Wells Fargo (WFC) will earnings Friday morning before the opening bell.

**Highlights**

* Intel (INTC) analysts gave a nod of approval to the chipmaker on its move to recruit Micron’s (MU) David Zinsner to serve as Chief Financial Officer as part of a broader shakeup by CEO Pat Gelsinger. ""Intel now has a 'dream team,' with 'one of the best CEOs and one of the best CFOs in the semiconductor industry,'"" Citi analysts said. Zinsner ""has driven higher operating margins at every public company he has been CFO at.""
* The National Federation of Independent Business reported that its Small Business Optimism Index rose 0.5 point to 98.9 last month. Of small business owners who responded to the organization’s survey, 22% said inflation was their primary operating concern — up from 18% in November.

* The U.S. judge hearing the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust case against Facebook said on Tuesday that he would not dismiss the government's lawsuit.
* Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank, is reducing overdraft fees from $35 to $10 starting in May and will stop charging overdraft fees in February.
* Twitter (TWTR) has become a minority stakeholder in digital advertising company Aleph. CEO of Aleph said, “We are honored to have Twitter as an investor in Aleph. Their investment is a clear endorsement of our efforts to educate a new generation of digital professionals equally around the globe.""

* NVIDIA and Arm submitted a 28-page written submission to the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority outlining why the $40 billion acquisition should be approved. In it, both companies accuse critics of “romanticizing” Arm’s history, ignoring the company’s current financial condition, and overstating Arm’s market power.

2022-01-03 22:49:24,r/stocks,Visa (V) vs PayPal (PYPL),"**Why is Visa (V) is a better stock to buy than PayPal (PYPL) right now**

**(This is also my first stock analysis so please leave some tips on what I can do better)**

I have recently many people comment on the recent sell of in PayPal and visa, PayPal being the more drastic dip. This recent dip makes people believe that PayPal is at a crazy discount right now and leads to a lot of retail investors btding. I believe with the information provided that visa is a much safer and better investment for consistent growth rather than PayPal.

However, I believe that PayPal's recent sell-off was justified as the price did not meet the stock's performance and have been on a constant downtrend since the Pinterest debacle.

**Note I do own 7 Visa shares and 1 PayPal share. (Previously owned more PayPal but have been switching it around recently)**

Many people try to compare the usage of using Venmo compared to an older network of visa. However, when you look at Venmo as a p2p service for the younger community it controls about 57% market share filled with a lot of other fintech companies quickly growing rapidly. Like cash app gaining quickly on market share 180% increase in market share YOY. Now the same thing can be said about Visa, however, visa has the largest market share dominating the market.  I’m thinking of it as a too big to fail type of company because who does not have a visa?

Overall, the p2p service space that PayPal dominates is a way smaller total market size if you compare the processing sector of visa.

**Growth**

Visa has a 5-year CAGR of around 15.4%, while PayPal has a CAGR of 19.3%

PayPal has been trading around a pe of 45 with a median pe for the last 10 years at 51.01

While visa has been trading 43 with a median pe ratio in the last 10 years at 32

Indicating a similar growth between the 2 companies.

**Dividend**

PayPal has no dividends currently

VISA currently offers a 0.38$ dividend which has been increased in December by 17.19% from the previous year. Visa has a long history of dividend payments back from 2008 to today. They have been increasing dividends by about 15% YoY for the past 3 years.

&amp;#x200B;

**Margins**

Visa margins are very impressive and quite honestly a cash cow with net margins at 54%% roughly and have been hovering around that range for the past 10 years. Therefore, the recent news with amazon in the UK not accepting visa cards is irrelevant. They are very likely to sort some agreement for a cheaper transaction rate and Visa can afford to do that as they have incredible margins to do so. Visa credit cards also control about 80% of all credit cards in the UK likely causing a negative effect on both sides if this goes through.

PayPal’s margins are sitting at a net of 17.58% which is also impressive but is substantially inferior to Visa’s.

**Concerns**

For me, the main concern is the integration of defi projects around the crypto space like LUNA, AVAX which can affect greatly on companies like Visa and PayPal. However, I think we are still years away from that being a significant factor.

**Overall,**

The growth rate for both companies has been great and somewhat similar, however with one company you get increased profit margins and dividends which are increased annually. PayPal’s management has also raised some serious concern after letting something like the Pinterest acquisition not to mention the insane amount of hate towards it from customers they literally have a sub for it lol. Overall if I were to compare these 2 at their current prices, I would rather put my money into Visa.",67,16,No-Ad3078,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/rvd0k9/visa_v_vs_paypal_pypl/,rvd0k9
2021-12-29 12:19:17,r/stocks,"Realizing These 7 Trading Mistakes Saved Me Over $200,000 in Losses This Year"," If you’ve recently started trading, you’re likely very disturbed by the recent pullbacks and volatility, especially among high-flying household tech stocks like Docusign, Roku, and Teladoc, which are down 45% from recent highs. Even more jarring was the complete crash of Chinese darlings Alibaba, Tencent, and JD.com due to concerns that the communist government in China would be, well, communistic. 

Institutional investors used fears of inflation and the latest COVID variant as a reason (excuse) to get out of positions they knew had been overbought. And all the stop losses got triggered thereafter, creating a snowball effect. This has restored some sanity to the market, though I’d argue many stocks are still overvalued.

 I’m going to lay out 7 mistakes everyone makes when investing below in the hope that it provides some guidance to those who need it. If you feel you don't need, just don't read it. Thanks.

**Expecting the Market to Rise in a Straight Line**  
 While this seems straightforward, many people believe the stock market only goes up and never down. This is not true. The market goes up 80% of the time BUT not all companies are taken on that ride and you should expect a 10% pullback every other year. 

Likewise, the number of smaller pullbacks of 5% have become more common over the past decades and now average around 5 per year. Keep in mind, these pullbacks represent the average of a bundle of 500 stocks, meaning some stocks are affected a lot more than 5% and others less than 5%.

**Not Picking An Entry Point**

These market pullbacks represent great buying opportunities, but should not be relied on as the entry points because in the moment investors don’t know if it’s a 5, 10, or 20% correction. Instead of trying to predict the future outcome of a pullback, I have a set list of companies I want to buy always ready to go with my target price.

Think of this list as your budget - you determine this entry price and you don’t budge from that target. If the stock drops to the price or below, it’s a buy, and you enter the trade. I may lose more money on the way further down but that’s OK, I got my entry price and need to have faith in the investment rebounding. I have gotten burned more times than I care to count by getting impatient and buying a stock above my target price only to watch in horror as it tumbles back down to the price I wanted to pay to begin with six months later.

Truth be told, this is more a game of patience and good technology. I set price alerts using Fidelity (always to my phone not email) and I try to ignore the FOMO as the stock rides up high quickly.

Being a successful investor is a lot like being on a diet at all times. I’m constantly hungry for more, wanting to jump in an enjoy decadent treats, and having to sacrifice my desires for better outcomes. If I’m not feeling the friction of personal restraint, I’m not investing, I’m just gambling.

**Setting Entry Prices Based on Graphs Only**

OK, so I need to set an entry point to avoid being the bag holder - how do I do that? There are many ways. The worst way IMHO is to look at a chart and pick a number based on where a stock has been previously aka a previous dip. Technical analysts will often point to support and resistance lines in graphs and talk  about whether or not a stock will hold its fall at a resistance point or break out through a previous resistance line. 

New support and resistance lines are forming all of the time because of the micro and macro environments. Said plainly, events cause these levels - they are not mystical levels that form on their own. People react to events and prices change. And many levels are created by people in support of their own thesis these lines exist, self-perpetuating their existence. Usually, they are formed around events. The events could be company news or it could be macro news about the inflationary environment, policy changes, or other world events. So it’s critical to track events and know what’s going on with the company and the world before going in. You can do this through the news or by using technology.

I use a software system to keep track of major company events and help me understand how they will impact the price movement. I haven’t found a more efficient way of doing that.

If you’ve taken account of events, the next thing to do is find a way to value the stock. There are many ways to do this and I plan on writing a post with more detail on that in the near future. For now, I’ll note a few simple ways to do this.

**Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E)** \- the P/E ratio gives an analysis of the stock’s price relative to its annual earnings or profit. The higher the P/E, the more expensive the stock. The easiest way to understand this is to think about your investment as the share price and the annual return on that investment as the earnings. If the P/E is 20, it would take you 20 years to recoup your investment in terms of the value of those earnings. This ignores a lot of things like inflation, free cash flow, the total assets of the company, company debt, and how fast the company is growing. But it’s a useful back of envelope way to give an idea about whether the investment may turn out well. If a stock has a P/E above 20, the company should be growing double digits annually, not be riddled with debt, and have competitive positioning so it doesn’t get crushed. If it’s trading over 60 P/E, it should be growing earnings and revenue triple digits to justify the valuation, or be in a position to dominate a market for many years to come.

Other valuations include the Price to Book ratio, the Price to Sales Ratio, and the Enterprise Value to EBIDTA. We’ll have to cover these in another post. For now, know they exist but you can use the P/E as a north star to guide your entry points and avoid overpaying for stocks. In an environment of low inflation, P/E matters less than it does than in an environment of higher inflation, where companies with less earnings and cash flow have to borrow more at higher interest rates to continue growing.

So set your entry price on a reasonable P/E ratio that is in line with the historical 5-year P/E of the company and its peers (Fidelity makes this readily available). If you buy a company with no earnings, it’s going to get crushed every time there’s an inflationary scare because in order to grow, that company has to borrow money or raise more money by selling more shares or debt, which dilutes the company’s value. Likewise, if their high growth stalls for even one quarter, the stock will go into free fall. So you need to monitor earnings results very closely if you own one of these stocks.

**Creating a Portfolio That is High Risk**

If I had a hundred dollars for each time someone asked my opinion about Nio, PlugPower, or Docusign, I’d be able to pay a full year’s college tuition. Yea, these stocks have done very well until now. But they are volatile stocks all based on the premise of future domination with little evidence to back that up today. Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE growth stocks. But they should compose a portion of a portfolio, not the whole pizza.

I allocate 20% of my portfolio to growth stocks and that’s pretty high, but I’m willing to lose over half of that for the longer term gains. I would never be 100% growth stocks as that is an easy way to experience immense pain as these stocks are likely to crash heavily as we’ve seen recently. And I buy and sell these stocks - I don’t hold them forever.

There are far better experts than I at creating the killer portfolio allocation, but my advice is to carve it up into stable dividend payers like Verizon, large cap leaders in tech like Apple, large cap healthcare companies (I like Anthem), large cap payments companies like Visa and Mastercard, strong value mid-cap companies like my favorite: Crocs, some consumer staples stocks that people need even when things are bad, some semi-conductors that aren’t overpriced, and companies leading in new industries that actually make money. 

**Buying At The Peak Price**

If you’ve ever bought at the peak, the following scenario should sound familiar: An event happens, the stock you’ve been hearing about all year, which is up 100%, rallies 13% today and another 15% the next day. Analysts up their price targets, the news is buzzing that the company is unstoppable, and days later the stock is up another 50%. You’ve heard about this company for a long time and have wanted to buy it but waited. Everyone you know owns it, brags about their gains, and it looks like it’s making another unstoppable, huge run. Not wanting to be left on the sidelines missing out again, you throw some money at the stock, buying at its peak. A week later, UBS calls the stock’s valuation detached from reality and lowers its price target, sending the stock down 15%. In the days that follow, it continues to sink, with analysts downgrading their estimates. Then they miss their earnings target, and the stock plummets further. You’re unsure what to do, so you do nothing and watch your losses pile up. You are the bag holder.

If the description above sounds uncomfortably familiar, don’t fret: you’re not alone. We’ve all been there. The only thing to do is to learn from the events and take the lesson that it’s very risky to buy at the peak, where a peak can be defined as the point at which everyone knows about it, is talking about it, and has already invested in it. If you come in after, you’re taking on more risk than the possible reward. So what should you do when you want to own that stock? Wait. Set a reasonable entry point and wait. You might have to wait 9 months. Women do this for children all the time while being wildly uncomfortable. You can handle not buying a stock for 9 months.

There is another way to play it that’s more complicated: you could pick a price that is a little above your entry point and sell a put. That gives someone else the right to sell the stock to you at that price and in return you collect the premium for the contract. If the stock you want is trading at 300 and the price you want to pay is 200, sell a $30 put at 230. If the stock never comes down, you make $30 a share, and you have profited from the stock. Congrats! If it does come down under 230 and the contract is exercised, you end up buying the stock at 230 but pocket a $30 premium, making your net purchase price 200 - just the price you wanted! Win win.

**Losing Faith &amp; Conviction**

After taking a beating on a stock or ten, it’s easy to lose faith in your abilities to make sound investments and even easier to lose conviction in your other stock purchases. It’s these moments where you need to remind yourself that the market goes up AND down and you will have many more years to make money (if you’re healthy) provided you learn from your mistakes and continue trying.

I write down everything I’ve learned in a list that I revisit time and time again. This list is now 30 points strong on what not to do based on 30 ways I’ve lost money. It’s now a list of how to make money in the stock market (and how to populate blog content).

If you write down what went wrong, you’re committing to lifelong learning and to be improving. If you don’t and opt to wallow in self-pity, you’re bound to not only repeat these mistakes, but you’re likely to sit out on future market rallies because you lack conviction. The best buying opportunities comes when market participants feel powerless and are willing to sell their stock at steep discounts.

“When there’s blood on the streets, buy property.”

**Not Having an Exit Plan**

How much money do you want to make on your investment? The answer can’t be infinity and I don’t know isn’t much better. Professional wealth managers aim for 6% a year, net of fees. The S&amp;P 500 returned an average of 7.5% over the past 20 years.

So what will I do if a stock I own goes up 300% in one year? I sell it and wait for an opportunity to buy it again when it comes back down to earth. Why? Because I’ve accomplished the returns I’m looking for. I sell it because I reached my exit price, even if that happens a lot faster than I thought it was going to because my goal is to make money not to own stocks.

Some stocks *are* long holds. Visa, Apple, Microsoft, Google - it’s ok not to have a lifetime price target on these. For others less established, I like to have a goal. I bought Lemonade stock at $44 for example. When I bought it pre-IPO, I thought it was a 10X stock over 10 years. In the first year, the stock skyrocketed to 175. It was too much too fast for the trajectory I was expecting so I sold some at 80 and the rest at 120. Making 2 x and 3x my money in one year reached my goal of 10X return over 10 years in terms of the annual return, so I was out. I also thought the valuation was not justified. Others agree, and the stock is back at $44 now. If I had bought and held, I would have achieved no profit. Instead, I grossed $50,000 on a $20,000 investment.

In case you’re curious, I do plan to buy Lemonade again IF they can prove they are able to gross more revenue per existing client. Right now they are paying too much for customer acquisition.

Just remember to take taxes into account when determining your profit targets. In my case, I held LMND for a year prior to selling, so I paid capital gains taxes not income tax rates.

2021-12-18 02:31:29,r/stocks,Barron's top picks for 2022 (IBM what?),"I'm most surprised by the IBM pick. Barron's called it ""baby Microsoft"" and:

&gt;Under CEO Arvind Krishna, IBM has spun off a pedestrian business of managing data centers into Kyndryl Holdings (KD), refocused on the cloud and artificial intelligence, and vowed to start growing again for the first time in about a decade.

&gt; Wall Street is skeptical about IBM’s prospects, but one bull, BofA Global Research’s Wamsi Mohan, has compared Krishna to Satya Nadella, the Microsoft CEO who transformed the company over the past seven years.
&gt; 
&gt; IBM, whose shares trade around $126, is valued at 11 times projected 2022 earnings. And it has the highest dividend yield in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, at 5.3%.
&gt; 
&gt; If Krishna is successful in boosting sales and margins while making IBM relevant again, there could be a lot of upside in a largely forgotten stock.

Is IBM really a hidden gem or is it rightfully forgotten? Here are the rest of the picks:

* Royal Dutch Shell (ticker: RDS.B)
* IBM (IBM), 
* Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)
* Hertz Global Holdings (HTZ)
* Amazon.com (AMZN)

# [Dow futures up 200 points following Fed decision to aggressively wind down asset purchases](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/15/stock-futures-market-open-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures rose sharply in early Thursday trading after the Federal Reserve signaled it would be aggressive on tapering and sees three interest rate hikes in 2022.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped about 222 points. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.7% each.
*****
&gt; Shares of companies that have done well in previous rate-hiking cycles led premarket gainers. Materials stocks FMC Corp. and Freeport-McMoRan both rose more than 3% ahead of the opening bell. Bank stocks also rose across the board, with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America all up about 0.6%.
*****
&gt; In transportation news, Delta Air Lines reported that it now expects to see a profit of $200 million in the fourth quarter, after previously projecting a loss. Shares rose 2.2% on the news.
*****
&gt; In other central banking news, the Bank of England announced it is hiking its key policy rate by 15 basis points to 0.25%. Markets were awaiting a separate policy decision from the European Central Bank. There also is more economic news on tap, with weekly jobless claims and housing starts out at 8:30 a.m. ET.
*****
&gt; Following the Fed news, traders accelerated their own expectations for interest rate increases. Fed funds futures trading now points to a 63% chance of the first quarter-percentage-point increase coming in May 2022, with chances also rising to about 44% that the central bank could make its first move as soon as March, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.
*****
&gt; Stocks traded in negative territory throughout the regular session Wednesday and turned higher ahead of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference in the afternoon at the conclusion of the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The Dow added 383 points, or 1.08%. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.63% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.15%.
*****
&gt; “The fact that the FOMC acknowledged new COVID variants as a threat to the economic recovery that could alter policy going forward, as well as the generally optimistic tone from Powell in the presser, helped spark a relief rally as the Fed meeting was viewed as being not-as-hawkish-as-feared,” Tom Essaye of the Sevens Report said in a note on Thursday.
*****
&gt; The Fed will begin reducing the pace of its asset purchases in January and buy just $60 billion of bonds each month going forward, compared to $90 billion in the month of December. That decision follows recent inflation data showing a 6.8% surge in November, which is higher than expected and the fastest rate since 1982.
*****
&gt; “The notion that elevated inflation levels would be transitory has finally been thrown out the window by the Fed and the latest policy adjustments are reflective of a committee that doesn’t want to miss the next train leaving the station,” said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management.
*****
&gt; Health-care stocks UnitedHealth and Amgen gained ground Wednesday, rising 3.1% and 2.6%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Adobe and Accenture are scheduled to report quarterly earnings before the opening bell. FedEx and Rivian will report after the bell.

2021-12-14 04:05:37,r/stocks,Overpriced less popular stocks propping up S&amp;P 500,"2021 has been a bad year for a lot of popular names deemed as overpriced. However there are a ton of not as frequently discussed stocks I've been checking out that seem relatively more overpriced than the 'overpriced' stocks that have already taken 20-30% haircuts. Makes me wonder if there is something to the idea of an 'index fund bubble' Some examples:

Intuit (INTU): 88 P/E, +79% YTD

IHS Markitt (INFO):  87 P/E, +48% YTD

Sherwin Williams (SHW): 47 P/E, +43% YTD

Fortinet (FTNT): 99 P/E, +153% YTD

I know I'm not looking at growth etc, but the fact that say Sherwin Williams has a higher P/E ratio than AMD, PYPL, and Visa to name a few seems odd.",130,65,m4329b,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/rfxkv9/overpriced_less_popular_stocks_propping_up_sp_500/,rfxkv9
2021-12-04 09:16:04,r/stocks,Is V a good buy right now?,"Hey there guys, I just started analyzing stocks more and I thought I´ll try to do that and post it here. That´s my first analysis for V. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I´ll try to answer everything.

Today we will look through the basics of Visa´s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for V´s stock using discounted free cashflow.

This is not financial advice and I personally own shares in V. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can. Always do your own due diligence.

First let´s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **39%** of their sales comes from **Data Processing Revenues**. Another **35%** comes from **Service** **Revenues**. **International Transaction Revenues** makes up for **20%** and the remaining **5%** are **Other Revenues.**

For the valuation:

We take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 6,9%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for V´s stock of **$222 per share**. But because we have to account for **V´s equity** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$220 per share**.

Now feel free to include a margin of safety to that.

With V´s price being at **$193** **per share** right now, it´s kind of undervalued. That´s why I think buying *heavily* might be a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That´s where you invest every month the same amount.

**Where I see V´s stock price in 5 years.** We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$498 per share** which is definitely higher than what it is now. 

**What I´ll do.** I believe V is here to stay. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That´s why I will start buying heavily every chance I get.

Thank you for reading and I hope I´ll see you again.",162,32,PeekingPotato,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r8l2e9/is_v_a_good_buy_right_now/,r8l2e9
2021-12-02 05:11:59,r/stocks,Visa and Mastercard,"Tickers: **VISA,** **MA**

They are both down 20%+ from their highs this year, improving the margin of safety. They still have a huge moat (each of these companies maintain operations in 200+ countries).

Both have a small dividend. Visa authorized an increase in theirs last week, with Mastercard doing the same yesterday. Mastercard has also approved a new $8B share repurchase program.

**Visa and Amazon Dispute**

For Amazon in the U.K, Visa cards only account for 7% of transactions, the smallest share of all card purchases. Amazon U.K primarily uses Mastercard for payments. For Amazon in the US, Visa is the dominant card.

They have specifically targeted the country that would impact them the least. Visa has also faced much more impactful restrictions from companies such as Walmart and Kroger and they ended up settling those disputes privately. It's clearly just a negotiation tactic from Amazon.

**Interest Rate Risk**

These companies derive revenue from client services, data processing, cross-border transactions, and value-added services, such as licensing fees. Meaning they have less exposure to interest-rate risk as they neither earn revenue from or bear any risk tied to the interest or fees paid by cardholders.",98,15,Senator_Beetlejuice,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r6ygbi/visa_and_mastercard/,r6ygbi
2021-12-01 18:06:12,r/stocks,What has been going on with V (Visa),"Visa used to be one of the best investments in my portfolio.  I had to sell right before Covid to purchase a home.  At the time, it killed me, but almost two years later the company is almost unchanged?   I no longer own any. 

Once I sold I stopped paying attention so I don’t have all the reasoning for the flat growth.

Is the stock still a buy in peoples minds?  Or does it still have a rocky road ahead?  

The price looks good to me but I’m not looking to buy a dividend stock without growth potential.",59,22,RealPaulieWalnuts,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r6jjm1/what_has_been_going_on_with_v_visa/,r6jjm1
2021-12-01 02:50:48,r/stocks,Rate my strategy... Visa and MC,"Tell me if I'm missing something... Visa and Mastercard seem to be joined at the hip. Their charts, P/E, forecasts, dividends, etc are similar. Currently down about 15% on Visa so I'm thinking of selling at a loss to offset taxes on some of my gains this year and moving that money temporarily into Mastercard. Then when the new year hits, switch it right back into Visa (I prefer this since it's my payment method of choice). 

You guys seeing anything I'm not? If it continues to drop, I can then start my next year with realized losses again. Win/win right? (Not counting the fact that I've lost money on this investment)",12,7,simassimas,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r63dlg/rate_my_strategy_visa_and_mc/,r63dlg

I'll almost definitely buy the stocks that are near their 52-week low (unless there's some reason I should not?). But debating whether to buy those near the 52-week average. Thoughts?

* STARBUCKS **@ $110** (Low $95, High $126, **Avg $111**) (Even though it's near it's average I'm concerned it won't drop below $110 this year so I might as well just buy now. Thoughts?)


**NEAR 52-WEEK HIGH:**

* AMD @ **$154** (Low: $72, **High $16**1, Avg $95)
* Apple @ **$156** (Low 116, **High $165**, $136) (Even though it's near it's high I'm concerned it won't drop below $156 this year so I might as well just buy now. Thoughts?)

# [Stocks rise led by tech shares as Nvidia soars](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/17/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stocks rose after Nvidia, the world’s most valuable chipmaker, reported better-than-expected third-quarter results and gave a positive outlook.
*****
&gt; Dow futures rose 24 points, or 0.07%. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.5%.
*****
&gt; Trading has been choppy this week with the major averages mostly wavering around the flat line, but the S&amp;P and Nasdaq are still on track for a positive week and are sitting less than 1% from their records. The Dow is 1.7% from its record.
*****
&gt; Nvidia shares popped more than 8% in premarket trading after beating on the top and bottom lines of its quarterly results and issued a bullish revenue forecast for the current quarter ending in January. The chipmaker reporter a 55% gain in data center sales from the same period a year ago and its biggest market, gaming, reported a 42% sales increase.
*****
&gt; Those gains helped lift other chip stocks in early morning trading. Advanced Micro Devices gained 2% while Skyworks and Micron Technology added more than 1%.
*****
&gt; Retail continued its big earnings week. Shares of Macy’s and Kohl’s kicked the day off jumping 11% and 7%, respectively. Both companies smashed quarterly profit and revenue estimates, much like its peers who reported earlier in the week. Most have reported same-store sales gains from the previous year and investors are optimistic going into the holiday shopping season.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere, Deere saw its shares rise more than 1% after it came to a resolution with workers who had been on strike since Oct. 14.
*****
&gt; Dow component Boeing also saw its shares rise another almost 2% following on upgrade from JPMorgan, which said the aerospace giant has significant upside as it clears up several issues that have dogged the company.
*****
&gt; Going in the other direction, Cisco Systems fell 5% due to weaker revenue guidance and a revenue miss. Kraft Heinz shares also dropped more than 2% after the company announced a secondary offering of common stock.
*****
&gt; On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 211 points, dragged down by a 4.7% loss in Visa shares. The S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.26%. The Nasdaq Composite ticked 0.33% lower, despite most mega-cap technology companies closing in the green.
*****
&gt; The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 was the relative underperformer on Wednesday, dropping 1.2%.
*****
&gt; “Recent economic reports remain strong, but today’s stock market action highlights that it is already discounting another Covid cycle,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group.
*****
&gt; “Concerns about Covid also caused the 10-year bond yield to decline for the first time in 6 days and kept downward pressure on commodity prices including another sizable drop in crude oil prices. If inflation keeps rising while another Covid surge again stalls real economic activity, we may find out how the stock market handles a pseudo-stagflationary episode,” he added.
*****
&gt; Investors await more retail earnings on Thursday with Applied Materials and Palo Alto Networks reporting after the bell.
*****
&gt; The Labor Department will report last week’s jobless claims data at 8:30 a.m. on Thursday. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting initial filings for unemployment insurance fell to 260,000 for the week ending November 13, from the previous week’s 267,000 claims.

All 5 have been fairly flat for perhaps over a month now.

I don't have the cash to do both. I know it's okay to average up, but isn't it better to buy dips of other great companies?? That way you don't sacrifice your gain % on your best stocks, and you can scoop in larger gains from something in a dip than something that is already ATH.

# [Stock futures are little changed after Lowe’s and Target post earnings beats](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/16/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed in morning trading Wednesday as investors weighed earnings reports from big-box retailers Target and Lowe’s.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by 14 points. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were little changed.
*****
&gt; Home improvement giant Lowe’s got a boost after reporting earnings that easily beat Wall Street expectations. The stock initially popped in premarket trading as the company not only topped the Street view but also raised its full-year sales forecast. Shares were last higher by less than 1%.
*****
&gt; Target posted beats on the top and bottom lines, however, its CEO noted rising costs related to supply chain issues and compensation could have an impact going forward as the company plans to absorb those costs rather than passing them onto the customer. Shares slid 3.3% premarket.
*****
&gt; Shares of Dow component Boeing rose nearly 2% in premarket trading after the company received an Akasa Air order for its 737 MAX worth $9 billion. The aerospace company’s stock has been a laggard this year, up just 5.5%.
*****
&gt; Also, Tesla moved higher by about 1% as the stock continues its rebound after founder and CEO Elon Musk sold a chunk of his shares.
*****
&gt; On the downside, Visa shares slumped about 2% after Amazon said it will stop accepting payments made via Visa credit cards issued in the U.K. starting next year.
*****
&gt; The moves in futures trading come after fresh economic data and corporate earnings signaled U.S. consumers are ramping up spending despite rising prices.
*****
&gt; The Dow added 54.77 points, or 0.15%. The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.39% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.76%.
*****
&gt; Retail sales rose 1.7% in October, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday, faster than economists expected. The figure measures how much consumers spend on goods across a number of categories.
*****
&gt; Strong quarterly results from Home Depot also boosted investor sentiment Tuesday. The home improvement retailer led gainers on the Dow after earnings topped analyst estimates. Walmart also reported better-than-expected results, though its shares declined.
*****
&gt; “US stocks rallied after an impressive retail sales report, solid industrial production data, and retail earnings showed the consumer is handling the current pricing increases. All signs are pointing to a very strong holiday season for retailers and that should help keep sending stocks higher,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, said in a Tuesday note.
*****
&gt; Investors await more retail earnings Wednesday from TJX, Bath &amp; Body Works and Victoria’s Secret. Other major companies reporting results Wednesday include Cisco Systems and Nvidia.

The online retail giant blamed the decision on high fees charged by Visa to process transactions.

The changes will come into effect as early as 19 January 2022, Bloomberg first reported, citing information that Amazon had shared with its customers this week, after they had purchased items.

2021-11-04 14:19:21,r/stocks,Gaining Visibility on Paysafe (PSFE) Parts 8-10,"Here are the final Parts 8-10, of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe.  Parts 1-7 covered Paysafe’s outlook on growth, debt, and profit, along with insider ownership and competition.  I recommend starting with the [introduction in Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qkgndd/peeling_back_the_layers_on_paysafe_psfe/) (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested.

&amp;#x200B;

# 8. Management

As part of Paysafe’s preparations for the next phase of growth, the company has undergone a complete management overhaul. Along with replacing nearly all the Board of Directors, in the last two years, they’ve hired a new CEO, new CFO, new CTO, new CIO, new CRO and new CISO. They’ve hired PayPal’s Chief Risk Officer and have also filled key division CEO positions with Facebook’s Head of Payments and Amazon Intl’s Head of Payments.  This does not sound like an operation with a passive outlook.

Still, many are rightfully frustrated that management has done little publicly to support the share price since going public. Despite a steady supply of [positive news](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes_value_creation_trajectory_is_very_much/), the CEO has not once meaningfully engaged the media to highlight Paysafe’s value story.  It may be that management is deliberately downplaying its messaging while shares move from short-term trader’s hands to those of value-seeking funds in order to better secure long-term share value.  Or, they are simply focused on producing the numbers.

Regardless, what management may lack in public storytelling, it makes up for in execution. In the short time since they went public, they have announced 3 new acquisitions and over 25 expanded partnerships with the likes of [Visa](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/skrill-usa-launches-skrill-virtual-visar-prepaid-card-in-us/), [Coinbase](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2021-03-25/paysafe-s-skrill-expands-crypto-offering-to-us-with-coinbase), [Fubo Gaming](https://www.paysafe.com/eu-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-streamlines-payments-for-interactive-wagering-with-fubo-gaming-in-us/), [FOXbet](https://www.njgamblingfun.com/nj/sports-news/paysafe-continues-its-push-into-online-gaming), [Golden Nugget](http://www.greensheet.com/newswire.php?newswire_id=53685), [Bankable](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-partners-with-bankable-to-provide-omnichannel-banking-services/), [Wix](https://www.pymnts.com/digital-payments/2021/smbs-can-accept-payments-with-paysafe-skrill-on-wix/), [Repay](https://www.repay.com/repay-partners-with-paysafe-to-enable-u-s-merchants-to-accept-online-cash-payments/), [WynnBet](https://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/news/wynnbet-taps-paysafe-for-payments-and-marketing-solutions/), [Betfred USA](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-expands-betfred-usa-sports-partnership-through-income-access-deal/), [OwnersBox](https://incomeaccess.com/contenthub/ownersbox-launches-affiliate-program/), [Dutch neobank bunq](https://www.paysafe.com/eu-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/bunq-partners-with-paysafe-to-enable-cash-deposits-for-digital-banking/), [IntelliPay](https://intellipay.com/paysafe-expands-us-partnership-with-intellipayto-offer-online-cash-payments/), Glory Ltd, Parx Interactive, TripGift, SweePay, SimplePayMe, [Smart Property Systems](https://globalfintechseries.com/banking/digital-payments/paysafe-partners-with-smart-property-systems-in-north-america/), Ambassador Cruise Line, Shelby Financial, ResponseCRM, ZEN, [Montana Lottery](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-powers-online-payments-for-montana-lotterys-sportsbook/), PlayUP, [SuperBook Sports](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-platform-launches-with-superbook-sports-in-colorado-and-new-jersey/) and [Bitrise](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-accelerates-innovation-with-bitrise-for-faster-digital-wallets-payments/).

Also during this time, they announced the appointments of:

* Digital wallet division CEO, [Chirag Patel](https://www.paysafe.com/en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-appoints-chirag-patel-to-lead-its-digital-wallets-division/) (fmr Head of Payments at Amazon Intl., Santander)

* Boardmember [Mark Brooker](https://fxnewsgroup.com/forex-news/executives/paysafe-appoints-mark-brooker-as-non-exec-director/) (fmr COO Betfair, non-exec dir. William Hill)

All that done while reporting a profitable quarter, beating on revenue and EPS consensus, reporting 41% total payment volume (TPV) growth, refinancing all debt for significant cost savings, after putting deals in place throughout North America to lead in any new iGaming market as soon as it opens (as just happened with their 100% positioning in Canada’s [newly opened](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/canada-legalizes-single-game-sports-191629457.html) sports betting market).  As Bill Foley said, “we’re seeding the future growth right now… The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective…It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.”  They have not slept on this promise even as they quietly lay the groundwork to do the same thing in South America.

Lastly, major shareholder and Paysafe Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley has repeatedly proven himself to be a trusted and highly effective deal maker with a remarkably consistent track record in growing shareholder value.  Bloomberg describes Foley as someone who prides himself on operating experience, who has a known talent for corporate maneuvering and brings with him a full team of seasoned financial managers.

The types of acquisitions described in Part 1 are central to Paysafe’s “value creation playbook” which is exactly how Foley, grew FIS 36x from a market cap of $2.5 billion to over $90 billion. From the beginning of the deal to bring Paysafe public, Foley [said](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Foley-Trasimene-Acquisition-Corp-II-and-Paysafe-investor-call-Final.pdf), “those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe... FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell.”

In this context, it’s worth underscoring Foley’s undeniably history of simultaneously growing multiple companies.  Over just the last six years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3x, Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6x, and Black Knight 8.7x. He’s also known for growing Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion (3,600x). In all cases, he has significantly expanded their margins between 500 to 1800 bps. Foley said, “My whole history and career has been around acquiring companies and fixing companies.”  Though he’s not Paysafe’s front man, his fingerprints are evident and IR has recently assured that “  Bill is highly engaged with the company.” Personally, I don’t doubt it.

&amp;#x200B;

# 9. Lockup Expiration

Some bears still point to PSFE overhang from lockups but all share lockups expired months ago, except for founder shares which constitute about 4% of outstanding shares ([20F p. 135](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000119312521104105/d159702d20f.htm#toc)). That lockup is expected to expire in December. Personally, lockup expiry of such a small percentage of shares is not deterring me from continuing to build a position before Paysafe starts reporting better numbers. This is especially true when those shares are controlled by Chairman Foley, who is central to Paysafe’s value creation playbook. Between Foley’s consistent track record, the proxy statement below and Blackstone’s stance on future growth, all signs indicate a long-term hold.

Upon approving the deal to bring Paysafe public, the founders identified “base returns for a four year hold period” of “2.9x to 3.8x” from $10.

From their proxy statement (SEC filing-[DEFM14A](https://pdf.secdatabase.com/2681/0001193125-21-060961.pdf)): “The Business Combination could provide base returns for a four year hold period assuming exit multiples between 20-25x next twelve month EBITDA, reflecting a range of internal rate of return of 30.9% to 39.2% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9x to 3.8x, in each case, based on the FTAC initial public offering price of $10.00 per share, while recognizing that the achievement of such returns could not be assured, and that the Business Combination has similar characteristics to other transactions involving Mr. Foley in the financial technologies industry, including an attractive platform with a defensible market position and multiple attractive acquisition opportunities to strengthen market position further, each of which made PGHL an attractive investment for FTAC.”

&amp;#x200B;

# 10. Valuation

Paysafe is building an integrated architecture that is worth more than the sum of its parts.  By leveraging an asset-light cloud-based model to efficiently scale up in new high growth markets globally, Paysafe is a perfect example of the low capex Fintech profile that generally warrants high valuation multiples.

Now trading around 4x a conservative F2022 revenue with nearly every institutional owner’s cost basis 20-40% higher than the current price, it would appear PSFE is severely undervalued. Perhaps because Paysafe didn't go public via the traditional IPO method it is being lumped in with highly speculative pre-revenue ventures.  But Paysafe is anything but that.

Or maybe the current low price is simply a reflection of broadly disseminated misleading information like the articles on debt quoted in Part 2 or like the several articles falsely claiming Paysafe went public at a 3x higher valuation above its 2017 take private price. Some articles claim this by mistaking British pounds for US dollars while a Yahoo Finance article claimed a ""300% higher"" valuation with bad math and a false comparison between enterprise value (inclusive of debt) and a misquoted 2017 market cap price of “$3.7 billion”, exclusive of debt.  Inclusive of debt (enterprise value), Paysafe was taken private for $4.7 billion, according to [Reuters.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/qfopku/credit_suisse_revised_to_neutral_detail/)  To make its bear case, that article misquotes the relevant 2017 take private value by a full billion dollars.

Initially, I wondered why just about every bearish article relied on faulty or misleading information to make its valuation case, or why so many platforms misreported PSFE’s financial data, like YF’s overstating a Q1 EPS miss as -0.23 EPS instead of -0.05 (fixed months later); or why does a [Credit Suisse analyst](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/qfopku/credit_suisse_revised_to_neutral_detail/) offer new price targets 4 times in 5 months with the first change just two days after initiating coverage and the last change, to neutral, just two weeks before Q3ER.  Instead of waiting a few days for new data highly relevant to his thesis, the analyst cites, as if Q2 were a new revelation, months old information most of which was available before he first initiated coverage. (Coincidentally, he issued this two minutes before pre-market, precisely when PSFE was on the verge of breaking above the confluence of its 9-month downtrend resistance line and the 50DMA).  Negligence or intentional price manipulation, take your pick.  Skeptics may cringe at this idea but this is really nothing new.  It’s not like the market is [unaware](https://www.sec.gov/tm/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsanalystshtm.html) of analyst [conflicts of interest](https://web.williams.edu/Economics/Honors/2004/MSirignanoThesis.pdf) or that Credit Suisse has shown itself to be an upstanding market participant (think lawsuit for misleading investors on [Archegos](https://fortune.com/2021/07/29/credit-suisse-report-archegos-loss-bank-massive-culture-problem/), [$5.3B fine](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/23/deutsche-bank-and-credit-suisse-agree-billion-dollar-fines-with-us-authorities.html) for mortgage backed securities,[$2.5B fine](https://cn.reuters.com/article/uk-creditsuisse-investigation-idUKKBN0E00WM20140520) after pleading guilty for aiding in tax fraud, and the recent [$547M fine](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/credit-suisse-resolves-fraudulent-mozambique-loan-case-547-million-coordinated-global) after admitting to regulatory breaches, secret loans, lying to authorities and spying on employees). On the other hand, this could be CS trying to clean up its act by playing it safe or an analyst trying to preserve his reputation by keeping price targets closer to market.  If so, this may have the flip-side benefit of future incremental upgrades.

Obviously, this is all conjecture, which really doesn’t matter in the long run.

True price discovery will take form as share rotation plays out and Paysafe's value story becomes clear.

&amp;#x200B;

Until then, here are a few reference points:

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at Paysafe’s eCash segment as a separate company:

The eCash segment is a high margin business with over 12 million active users, $5 billion in volume, $405 million in TTM revenue and $157 million EBITDA. For H1/21, they just reported 49.4% YoY revenue growth and 81.6% YoY EBITDA growth. Not many Fintech companies can claim that.

Adyen is a Fintech with a similar growth profile, (46% YoY revenue growth and 27% YoY EBITDA growth). Applying Adyen’s 19x EV/rev ratio to Paysafe’s eCash business alone, would give it a $7.6 billion enterprise value. That’s close to the current valuation of the entirety of Paysafe, yet this one segment represents less than a third of total revenue.

Using Adyen’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 149x would value Paysafe’s eCash segment at $23.3 billion. Even when applying the company’s entire debt to that one segment, the share price for just the eCash business alone would still be $26.62.

Again, that represents less than a third of Paysafe’s total business.

&amp;#x200B;

Brick &amp; Mortar Payment Processing

Paysafe is a value play right now but bears focus on growth.  Paysafe has an established history of 27-30% CAGR but because recent growth was temporarily stifled by China de-risking exits and Covid-related closures, some equally hard-hit brick &amp; mortar payment processing partners, like Visa and Mastercard, offer an interesting comparison.

For 2020, Visa reported negative YoY revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%). Similarly, Mastercard reported negative YoY revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%). Their forward growth is projected to be 7.7% and 10% respectively.

In all forward growth metrics, including EBITDA and EPS, they do worse than Paysafe, yet they both trade at an EV/Rev multiple of roughly 24X.  This would put PSFE at $41.80.

&amp;#x200B;

Digital Wallet vs. Digital Wallet

Many compare the #1 digital wallet, PayPal, to the #2 digital wallet, Paysafe, so, hopefully without striking a nerve, here’s a deeper look into that comparison:

As noted earlier, Paysafe’s stock was recently clobbered down 30% (to 3.2x P/S) on soft Q3 guidance even though they reaffirmed full year guidance and beat consensus on revenue and EPS.

By comparison, PayPal missed Q3 guidance for both revenue and EPS. PayPal was also reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance AND they missed on Q2 revenue consensus while also reporting a -23%YoY decline on EPS. PYPL only went down 10% (from a lofty 15x P/S) as news outlets characterized PayPal’s troubles as a “buying opportunity.”

Some will reasonably say that’s because PayPal has such strong growth history but, from the time PayPal’s numbers were available separately from its parent eBay, 2012-2020, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR ([$5.6b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal) to [$21.5b](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)). In that same period, Paysafe has grown 30.5% CAGR ([$169m](https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908) to [$1.43b](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_60f30e3ae06e5db5459655316a65dc97/paysafe/db/1111/9761/file/Supplemental+Financial+Information_+Paysafe+Limited_+Q1+2021.xlsx)).

Paysafe reported 27%CAGR prior to 2020’s restructuring and, in just the last year, when excluding Paysafe’s 2020 de-risking exits, they reported 23% YoY growth for Q2 which is on par with PayPal’s recent report of 19% YoY growth. This comparative history serves only to show that Paysafe has a strong track record that should not be discounted.

Paysafe is still priced as if it is a zero growth, pre-revenue speculative venture. Meanwhile, though some have called PayPal a “free cash flow machine,” Paysafe already generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal (25% FCF margin vs. 20% FCF margin).

There’s obviously more to this complex story but, for reference, below is PSFE potential share value when applying PYPL’s multiples (now 25% off highs) when factoring in all of PSFE’s potential acquisition debt and dilution:

* PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 66.9X puts PSFE at $33.10
* PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 44.3X puts PSFE at $24.90
* PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X puts PSFE at $28.40.
* PayPal’s EV/Rev ratio of 12.4x puts PSFE at $20.75
* PayPal’s free cash flow yield of 1.7% puts PSFE at $29.41

Those metrics average to a share price of $27.31

When factoring in a potential 24% growth, 35% EBITDA margin, 75-80% FCF conversion, the potential share value climbs fairly quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

Sector multiples:

Because Paysafe is far more diversified than the average Fintech, a while back I compared it to a wide basket of Fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign. Collectively, they have a \~12.5% growth rate. Unlike Paysafe, a third of this group reported negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA and half reported negative EBITDA growth. Paysafe also currently has better EPS and a better Debt/EBITDA ratio than over half the group.

After removing the top-end outliers in each category that put PSFE above $100 and discounting all by an additional 10%, here’s Paysafe’s share price with the averaged peer multiples:

* EV/EBITDA ratio : $45.67
* EV/Rev ratio : $40.17
* EV/FCF ratio : $39.72

Average : $41.84

&amp;#x200B;

It's worth pointing out here that, as happened with FIS’s tremendous growth history, stock prices tend to temporarily pull back in association with acquisitions. This may explain some of PSFE’s recent price action, but certainly not all.

&amp;#x200B;

Sure, it’s easy to read all of the material in Parts 1-10 and say, “the market doesn’t care,” but I’m confident that’ll change when share rotation settles and quarterly ER’s gradually shift focus from the past to the future.  Stripped of superficial misdirection, bear arguments often devolve down to variations of “look at the chart” and “price is truth.”  This has been said about many companies in the past as they position themselves for future growth.

No, this is not the next Amazon but Bezos had it right when he said, “The stock is not the company. And the company is not the stock. ... And so, while the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way.”

Do with this what you will. These are simply observations. Feel free to correct any errors, point out things I missed or use this material any way you wish. To be perfectly clear, this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor nor am I associated in any way with any commercial interests beyond my own.  Given how much disinformation has been out there, I thought I’d do my bit to peel back the layers on what I consider to be a reliable long term investment.

Amid a growing number of banking apps aimed at teens, Square Inc.’s Cash App today is broadening its reach by making its payments app available to younger teens between the ages of 13 and 17. Previously, the app required users to be at least 18 years old, like rival Venmo. The company says younger teens will need to get a parent or guardian to authorize their account, but can then begin to send peer-to-peer payments and take delivery of a customized Cash Card, powered by Visa.

In addition, teens will be able to send and receive peer-to-peer payments with family and friends, or anyone else on Cash App’s network of over 40 million monthly active users.  Other features also mirror the existing version of Cash App, including access to spending rewards at top retailers, ATM access with a $2 fee, and support for paycheck direct deposit.

This is a good news for square as more people can use cash app. As it competing with venmo, this first move will provide square the opportunity to increase the users loyalty to cash app. Square is still growing revenue at a fast pace and the best fintech stock to own for the next decade.",76,13,coolcomfort123,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qm3hiv/squares_cash_app_opens_up_to_teens_ages_13_to_17/,qm3hiv

I recommend starting with the [introduction in Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qkgndd/peeling_back_the_layers_on_paysafe_psfe/) (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested.

# 5. Blackstone Group

Many have blamed PSFE’s price decline on insider selling by pointing to Blackstone Group’s most recent 13F filings indicating a 23% reduction of their position. However, cross-referencing that 13F and the most recent [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000156459021050428/psfe-424b3.htm) with Paysafe’s March 31 20F ([p.124](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000119312521104105/d159702d20f.htm#toc)) shows that Blackstone holds the exact same number of shares as they did at the time of merger: 123.7 million shares.

It’s true, private equity lockups expired months ago and the 13F appears to show a sale of 37 million shares between Q1 and Q2.  BUT, to believe that they sold those shares then you’d also have to believe that they BOUGHT 37 million shares (a half billion dollar stake) in Q1, PRIOR to their payout from merger, and then immediately turned around and sold that exact same amount of shares for a SIGNIFICANT loss, just after merger. Seems like quite a stretch. When asked directly about Blackstone’s 13F and whether they’d sold shares, Paysafe’s investor relations responded, ""That swing in the 13F position was an issue with the 13F filing, but I see how that was confusing.  It was not reflective of any actual open market selling of Paysafe stock.""

Make of it what you will, but there’s no denying that the most recent records show that Blackstone still holds the same number of shares as they did per the original deal structure. The same is true of CVC.

Other factors to consider about Blackstone’s stake:

* Bears commonly claim Paysafe is overvalued because private equity made 3x on this investment. They reach this conclusion by ignoring the difference between market cap and enterprise value and by assuming PE was somehow awarded a full $9 billion from a $3 billion investment.  In truth, as Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/article/paysafe-m-a-foley-trasimene-idUSKBN28H1GP), Paysafe, “was taken private by Blackstone Group Inc and CVC Capital Partners in 2017 for $4.7 billion, inclusive of debt.” At the time of the 2021 merger, Blackstone/CVC received $2.3 billion in cash and $2.8 billion in shares. (280 million shares now worth $2.2b). At current levels, that’s a total of $4.5 billion in cash and shares. So, from their initial $3.9 billion USD (£2.96b) investment, Blackstone and CVC are currently up a mere 15%, between cash and shares. That’s after 4 years of significant strategic investment in restructuring, de-risking, replacing the Board of Directors and bringing in all new leadership (CEO, CFO, CTO, CRO, CIO, CISO etc.).
* This is part of a long term strategy. When taking Paysafe private, Blackstone/CVC [paid](https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/30924/blackstonecvc-agree-296-billion-deal-for-paysafe) “a 42% premium over the group's average value over the past year,” because, as Reuter’s [reported](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paysafe-group-m-a/paysafe-backs-3-9-billion-offer-from-blackstone-cvc-group-idUSKBN1AK0KN), insiders close to the deal said private equity had “a decade-long thesis that the shift to \[digital payments\] will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.” This “decade-long” thesis matches Blackstone’s typical investment term of “upwards of 7-10 years” according to their published [white paper](https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the_life_cycle_of_private_equity_insights.pdf). 7 to 10 years would be 2024-2027, which lines up with the FTAC board investment thesis, as outlined in their [proxy statement](https://pdf.secdatabase.com/2681/0001193125-21-060961.pdf) when approving the business combination (see #9).
* More recently, Reuters [reported](https://cn.reuters.com/article/instant-article/idINKBN28H1GP): “Martin Brand, senior managing director at Blackstone, said in an interview that retaining the majority of its investment would allow the buyout firm to benefit from the expected strong performance that Paysafe will generate going forward.” Blackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler said, “We believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.”
* And last month, CEO Philip McHugh [assured](https://bmo.qumucloud.com/view/2021-digitalbanking-paysafe#/): “You won’t see Blackstone and CVC going out there and doing big block sales any time soon. They see our story. They see the pipeline. They see the kind of top of funnel pipeline at the company where we’re gaining traction not only in US iGaming but in crypto, in travel and online gaming.”

&amp;#x200B;

# 6. Insider Ownership

Bears have argued that lack of insider ownership is a red flag but on top of the large stake held by board members, Blackstone and CVC, Paysafe’s [share registration](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000156459021050428/psfe-424b3.htm) confirms this argument is another non-starter:

* CEO Philip McHugh owns 2.4m shares
* COO Danny Chazonoff owns 2.2m shares
* Vice Chairman Joel Leonoff owns 8.3m shares
* Chairman of the Board Bill Foley owns 42m shares
* 3 Employee Trusts own 2.3m shares

&amp;#x200B;

# 7. Competition

Bears like to claim that a large competitor will eat Paysafe’s lunch, but it’s hard to ignore the fact that Paysafe is the one now encroaching on the North American market. Along with expanding in iGaming, they’re initiating their US launch of digital wallets Skrill and Neteller, with higher limits and [real-time pay-in/pay-out](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/skrill-usa-enhances-digital-wallet-080000953.html), which they say “fills a gap in the U.S. market.”

Some theorize that Paysafe’s competitive threat is the reason it’s being shorted, so as to inhibit the company’s ability to raise capital for further acquisitions, or to prime them for a buyout. But the company has leverage to spare and, when asked directly about a buyout, the CEO was very clear that they are not interested.

Speculation aside, bears who claim Paysafe will lose to competitors generally ignore how large, established, specialized and diversified Paysafe is in the global marketplace. With its focus on niche verticals, Paysafe is the undisputed leader in iGaming; it owns the second largest digital wallet in the world; it is #4 globally in integrated payment processing; it does over $100 billion in volume; it is used in 120 countries, and it is so good at multi-jurisdictional regulatory monitoring and risk management that other payment processors often use them as a middle man for transactions.

This last point is a key differentiator for Paysafe. CEO McHugh: “Because it’s complicated, the risk and regulatory management in payments and gaming at a global scale is not something that’s easy to copy.” He further notes, “We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem.”

Paysafe’s regulatory expertise enables them to innovate and enhance their moat with new risk-management solutions in different industries like their recently developed travel safeguarding [model](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Safeguarding-the-future-of-travel.pdf). It’s also a major reason why most iGaming operators use Paysafe’s [award winning](https://www.yogonet.com/international/noticias/2021/05/31/57794-paysafe-wins-payments-provider-award) platform (which, like any good pick and shovel play, makes them immune to the lack of brand loyalty among sports bettors who tend to migrate between iGaming operators).

Often embedded behind the scenes so that customers don’t know they are using it, Paysafe offers a trusted payment gateway that so effectively mitigates transaction liability that it is commonly used as a hidden partner. They work with [MasterCard](https://www.mastercard.com/news/europe/en-uk/newsroom/press-releases/en-gb/2020/march/paysafe-and-mastercard-extend-strategic-partnership/), Visa, Fiserv, [WorldPay](https://www.infinicept.com/payment-facilitator/archive/game-on-for-worldpay-and-paysafe/)(US DraftKings), [Apple Pay](https://www.paysafe.com/us-en/apple-pay/), [Google Pay](https://www.paysafe.com/us-en/google-pay/), [PayPal](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/rest-apis/paysafe-payments-api/payments-api/payment-methods/paypal/), [Sightline](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/rest-apis/paysafe-payments-api/payments-api/payment-methods/sightline/), REPAY, Intellipay, and a host of others. Paysafe is also behind the roll-out of the [award](https://www.paysafe.com/de-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-wins-two-payments-awards/) winning [Coinbase/Visa](https://www.thepower50.com/paysafe-issues-coinbases-new-visa-debit-card-enabling-easier-cryptocurrency-spending/) card.  In most cases it would take years of significant investment for others to match Paysafe’s level of monitoring, risk management and underwriting.  It’s often easier for a ""competitor"" to just give them a cut of the take.  CEO McHugh notes, “That’s where we get broader and deeper take rates over time. We process with Worldpay and have a capability with Fiserv as well, so we do multi-processor there.”  And Danny Chazonoff, COO, adds, “In Europe, we are the acquirer of record, so we have a principal membership with Visa and MasterCard. What that brings for us is the ability to do our own underwriting without any intervention at all from an acquiring bank.”

Rather than competing directly with other payment processors, Paysafe's angle is to quietly work with everyone.  This is partly why Bill Foley describes Paysafe as “ubiquitous. It’s just everywhere.”

Having cited a potential $58 trillion total addressable market, rather than competing in the general retail space, they focus on drilling down in “hard to do, hard to copy” niche verticals. CEO McHugh: “That’s why we like the deep verticals as opposed to trying to go head to head in the more general retail space which is more susceptible to scale economics.”

Through its emerging Unity Platform, Paysafe is also differentiating itself with a single cloud-based payment gateway that synthesizes a large [suite](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000119312521055290/d18419df4a.htm) of interconnected products and payment rails:

* credit and debit card processing
* integrated eCommerce processing
* online banking with real-time bank payments
* ACH check transactions
* digital wallets with real-time pay-in/pay-out functionality
* person to person payments in 40 currencies
* eCash solutions to digitize cash reaching a massive underbanked consumer base
* 38 cryptocurrencies in over 90 markets
* trading crypto and stocks in the wallet
* international money transfers
* branded gift card management
* recurring billing
* data mining for targeted direct marketing
* travel safeguarding for most major airlines
* tokenization and encryption (NFTs)
* in-store brick-and-mortar frictionless checkout (with competitive scalable pricing for a wider range of business sizes)

As the CEO points out, “Merchants just want sales regardless of payment method…There are very few competitors that can compete with us across all of the products…we continue to see the combination of our eCommerce gateway, digital wallets, online banking, and eCash solutions as a true differentiator in the market…The company that can synthesize that onto one platform will do very well.""

# Reviews:

While on the topic of competition, Bears who apparently aren’t aware of Paysafe’s award winning consumer products like [Paysafecard](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/PAYSAFE-LIMITED-120977165/news/Paysafe-Paysafecard-wins-Hermes-Business-Award-2021-36750942/) and [Skrill](https://www.paymentexpert.com/2019/11/01/skrill-wins-best-digital-wallet-at-juniper-research-2019-awards/), often point to an odd Trustpilot 1.9/5 star rating of nondescript “Paysafe” with only 287 reviews.

Meanwhile, they ignore Trustpilot ratings of Paysafe’s actual consumer-facing products like:

* Paysafecard: “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars) [43K reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)
* Skrill: “great” (4/5 stars) [19K reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/skrill.com)
* Skrill Money Transfer: “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars) [9K reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/transfers.skrill.com)

By contrast, Trustpilot rates competitors:

* PayPal: “bad"" (1.2/5 stars) [20K reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)
* Stripe: “Average” (3.3/5 stars) [6.6K reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/stripe.com)
* Cash App: “bad” (1.2/5 stars) [3K reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/cash.app)
* Zelle: “bad” (1.1/5 stars) [398 reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/zellepay.com)
* Venmo: “bad” (1.3/5 stars) [281 reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/venmo.com)

Note: This is not to bash competitors, but to point out how the bear argument is essentially meaningless. To be fair, those competing platforms get much better Apple mobile app reviews but, even there, Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill gets a respectable, [4.4 out of 5 stars](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/skrill-pay-transfer-money/id718248239) with 7.2K ratings. And at GooglePlay, their Paysafecard gets 4.3/5 stars with over [103K reviews](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.paysafecard.android&amp;referrer=adjust_reftag%3DcIGmAvoU2TFcK%26utm_source%3DWebsite%2B-%2BApp%2BSeite).

2021-10-29 11:39:43,r/stocks,"I made $500,000 trading stocks and options in 18 months. These are the 15 things I did that worked best.","I failed a lot while trading before, during, and after succeeding. I haven’t counted it up, but it’s likely I encountered losses in excess of $150,000 from making mistakes that were easily avoided, rash decisions, and not giving myself enough time to test out strategies. Net net, I’m up $500,000, but I was asked to share some of what worked for me over IM quite a bit after my last post and figured I’d lay it for others who may not want to waste money learning the hard way, as I did. 

These are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation - someone trying to increase net worth, not increase income - and they may not be suitable for everyone.

**Understand the Trading Environment**

One mistake I made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment I was in before picking out a strategy. What do I mean? I need to know where things are in the year, in relation to earnings season, and in relation to sector rotations. I need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and I need to watch the VIX.

**Mind the Gap Between Earnings Seasons**. I can’t stress this enough. When earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in, investors watch those like hawks. Good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market. 

In between earnings seasons, there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation, 10-year bond yields, and what the Fed is doing. This makes for a much jumpier market that’s more likely to pull back.  It’s also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios. They manage billions, so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class (e.g. value stocks, energy) and underweight in other asset classes (e.g. growth stocks, technology).

I try not to get caught by these patterns. I anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly. Simply put, I buy the pullback after the rotations have occurred and before earnings seasons begin as a general rule. Of course, I don’t do this if I expect a terrible earnings season. 

**Take Advantage of Sector Rotations**

The sector rotations are pretty predictable if you track the performance of the different sectors over the year. I do this by plotting sector ETFs on a graph and noting when one begins to gain that was flat while others that were up a lot begin to flatten or pull back. Professional investors tend to sell off sectors that have been hot the last quarter or two and replace them with underperforming sectors that represent a better value or opportunity for upside. If I run the P/E ratios for the sector ETFs, I can get a quick sense of the sectors that have had a hot run up over 30 P/E vs other sectors that are more modestly valued. Just keep in mind that certain sectors, like Tech, will always be valued more richly given their growth. So looking at P/E ratios is not apples to apples - it’s just a way to note if historically that sector is at the high end of its own typical valuation range.

Last year’s worst performing sector tends to be one of the best performing sectors the following year. This is because investors prefer to buy low and sell high. I don’t bet against this trend, it’s been around longer than I have and will continue to be around long after I’m dirt. 

Last year you couldn’t give away a barrel of oil. Last week, oil reached $80 a barrel. 

One of my favorite options strategies is to buy long dated calls at the money for sector ETFs that underperformed the previous year. I buy calls with expirations in 6-9 months, knowing that I will sell at my exit point which for me is a 100% gain. Sometimes this happens 6 weeks into the year; other times it takes 9 months. So long as I don’t overpay for the options, it works. I don’t like to pay more than the average price return of the sector. For example, if the sector ETF averages a 10% annual return and the ETF price is $100, I’m not going to buy a call for more than $10. That way, if the sector only moves 5%, I can still make money provided the price increase moves quickly enough.

**Make The VIX Your Friend**

The VIX is an easy way to gauge fear in the marketplace and is a hedge used widely against market pullbacks. If the VIX goes up, the market is worried. If it goes down, the market is getting bullish. If it stays up, everyone is on edge. It’s hard to make good trades in an environment where everyone is on edge and ready to hit the sell button. So be careful buying during times when the VIX is high. On the flip side, if the market has pulled back and the VIX starts to retreat away from its highs, that makes for a good entry point. 

Another interesting phenomenon is when the VIX is higher than normal, there tends to be a selloff the Friday before a long weekend. This happens because investors don’t want to sit through a long weekend that might hold worse news out of fear they will start their Tuesday with losses piling up. I’ve found this is a nice time to get some discounts at the end of the day Friday, or to run some weekly puts on Thursday afternoon before the dips. 

**Selecting Trades &amp; Investments**

**Have an Allocation Plan**

The first thing I recommend is determining, in advance, the amount of money you want to invest longer term vs the amount you want to invest short term vs the amount of money you might actually need to have available for life emergencies. Anything shorter term is higher risk, higher reward. I break my portfolio in the following buckets:

* 25% long-term market investment using equity ETFs that largely track the SPX or do a breakdown between bonds and the market. I use Vanguard funds and a small cap value fund called CALF. I will not touch this money for 15+ years.
* 25% cash. I like to be ready to buy the dips and have enough to spare. This way if a black swan event happens, I not only have money to invest, I have money to live on should things go bad for a while. This philosophy enabled me to buy options when COVID hit in 2020 without worrying if I could continue paying a mortgage for a year without a job. It’s also very useful if I have to roll covered calls to offset taxes and buy back expensive positions. I took this from Buffet FWIW.
* 30% options, mostly in tax advantaged accounts (IRAs). I aim for a 50% annual return overall with this portfolio, though it fluctuates a lot year to year.
* 10% long term blue chips stocks like Visa, Apple, MSFT, etc. I defend these positions when the stocks get overheated by selling calls on them and/or buying puts out of the money that expire after a typical sector rotation would occur. That can generate some additional income or help lessen the sting if the stock falls. 
* 6% long-term bets in a Roth IRA. These are equities I think all have a chance at a 10X return but that will take 5-10 years. It’s a lot of IPOs, small tech companies, and biotechs. I have to stomach pullbacks in this portfolio of 40-50% on the belief that a few of the 30 in here will more than compensate for it. This is a new strategy for me so I’ll let you know in 10 years if it works.
* 3% leveraged hedges.These are puts on my own positions, stocks, or the market at large. Generally I use VIX calls, buy puts, occasionally buy calls on the SPXS, and run strangles on investments (betting both up and down on the same stock using calls and puts).  
* 1% in other things I can’t mention due to the bots in here but they rhyme with tiptoe.

**Use Technologies to Find Ideas**

Unless you want to spend 8 hours a day reading news or are OK getting all your ideas from meme stocks and friends, you need to use tools to help you locate investment/trade ideas and be willing to pay for them. I value my time and am willing to pay .5% of my portfolio a year if it saves me time, and more if it generates higher returns. 

I’ve tried about a dozen or so services, including stock picking services like Fool and Investorsplace. Ultimately I decided the stock picking sites were not working for me because I did not want to wait 5 years to find out if they were the right recommendations and lost a lot of money learning that lesson on their pump and dumps. So I switched to analytics tools and my Fidelity platform. 

My favorite tools to use are Zack’s VGM score, Levelfields, and Fidelity. The Zack’s VGM measures a stock’s value, growth rate, and momentum. It’s an easy screen I can run off the basic level subscription to get a list of companies to look at. The caveat is that you need to run this screen often because sometimes the companies on the list get stale and have already moved 99% of the way they are going to move. So you need to keep an eye on what’s new to the list to avoid losing money. That part is crucial. 

The list usually represents companies that are well valued and poised to move up over the next 6-9 months. Warning: they can move very slowly so be patient and set your target exit to automatically exit. I use Fidelity to do my own due diligence on the stocks from there, examining their actual growth and earnings rates and ensuring there is no negative news against them which could drive down the price.

A friend recently turned me on to an AI tool called Levelfields. They have a lot of news alerts but only for the types of events that matter and are organized thematically. It helps me find trades on news events with high returns or get in early on the small to mid-cap companies you don’t usually hear about which fall between the cracks in the penny stock discussions and cnbc favorites. They often send alerts on company events before there’s any news out, which is really helpful. The interface shows you how stocks perform when these events happen, so it’s easy to figure out my entry and exit points and statistical likelihood of success.   
I use it a lot for pinpointing entry/exit points from options trades and have bought stock in a few companies I hadn’t ever heard of before that were absolutely crushing it on revenue and earnings. Not sure why, but they never came up in any of my Fidelity stock screens. I suspect it’s because there’s a lag in the data Fidelity is getting from S&amp;P but haven’t confirmed this. They send a lot of high quality alerts and my only wish is that they’d have a better way to rank the stocks in the alerts so I didn’t have to look up the stocks on Fidelity.

I use Fidelity for basic news reading, running stock screens for high growth stocks at decent valuations, looking deeply at the history of earnings results, actually trading options, and for their options scanner which tracks abnormal option activity.  I sell puts when I see abnormal call volume and run strangles if the stock is at a mid-point in its 52-week price range in case it shoots up and then down. I always set an automated exit.

Fidelity also has a cool probability calculator for options I use when selling puts. It tells you the probability of a stock falling below a certain range. I use that number to determine where to sell puts without a lot of risk. I do two standard deviations out and still buy a put with a lower strike price as insurance and sell weekly puts on high vol companies like GME and TSLA. My typical goal is to make 800 a week from these plays which I use to fund new call positions.

**Be Wary of Analyst Opinions**

If you’ve invested actively for a while, you’ve likely noticed a peculiar trend: as a stock is cratering, analysts are increasing their target purchase price on it. This is not for your benefit. Brokerages often make investment recommendations based on the research provided by their analysts, so there is inherent bias in the system. 

I’ve also found that few analysts recommend sell ratings. They are much more likely to issue calls to buy stocks. One study found less than 1% issued sell recommendations. What’s more, the track records of these analysts are usually about the same as coin flipping. CNBC has gotten very into pushing analyst views from big name firms (e.g. “Goldman Sachs says these 3 stocks are ready to explode”), but if you look at the actual analyst behind the headline, they are often inexperienced or wrong more than right. 

I am embarrassed to say I lost a lot of money listening to analyst opinions and believing their price targets were rooted in reality. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of an upgrade and if 4 analysts are all touting the stock at the same time it can create a bit of a ponzi effect, which is tradable. But it boils down to needing to do your own research.

**Good Things Come in Pairs**

Just about every stock has a peer or competitor. Most have several. I stopped trying to pick the winner and now place bets on multiple leaders. I’ve owned Visa and Mastercard. I own OLO and TOST. I have a handful of, um, herbal medicine providers. I like ETSY and AMZN. If you bet on a small group of competitors, it’s likely one will pull ahead and your odds of success will increase substantially. 

Similarly, it enables you to monitor the news of competitors which many investors use as a proxy. What do I mean? If Mastercard reports low cross border transactions, it’s highly probable Visa will be experiencing the same thing. So you can use the information from Mastercard to alter your position on Visa.

**Exercise Financial Discipline**

Even when I’ve been successful picking investments, I’ve run into problems with how to handle my successes. We’ve all experienced the thrill of being up huge and wondering how much higher it will go. That’s usually the moment I’ve learned I should be taking some gains. A few rules I try hard to follow but still screw up:

1. Take Profits Often.   
When an option or stock hits 100% return, I look to take some profit. It may not seem possible if you only bought 1 call, but it is. Just roll the call to a higher strike price and ensure the credit to your account equals your original investment plus substantial return. You can let the new call ride in case the stock gets going up. This ensures you cannot lose money. My rationale here is simple: at a 100% gain, I now have more to lose than I have to gain. You will be surprised how much this adds up when you trade often and how often you can be up 150% then down to -50% on the same positions, which makes me want to break things.  
If you find yourself up huge on an equity investment, switch to options. I did this for my BABA position and it saved me. When it hit 300, I was up 200%. I sold all the stock and bought options for the same number of shares. I had about 60K in stock and switched to something like 6K in options. When BABA crashed down to 150 I really didn’t care much. I was only down 4.5K instead of 30K. I had my profit of 40K locked in, so being down 4.5K was no big deal.  

2. Fail Fast.   
If the option price sinks to -50% in value, it’s likely time to call it quits unless you have a solid reason not to (praying is not a strategy). The other half of the value left can easily be eaten up by the time decay in the value of the option as I wait for the turnaround and it gets closer to the expiration date. If there’s negative news driving this, I’m out. I want to fail quickly. That allows me time to take the remaining 50% and generate gains with it on a better investment. I think this is the hardest rule for me to stick to as I tend to be an optimist.  

3. Profit Both Ways.   
If a stock I hold hits an all-time high in price or valuation, I look for a way to profit from the downside by selling covered calls or buying cheap puts. This enables you to stash some cash while riding the volatility wave. I hold Visa and when it hit 235 headed into earnings, I sold 3 calls and bought 10 puts. This offset a paper loss for me of \~20K yesterday alone by 7.5K in gains, which I secured as real profits. Assuming Visa will recover, that 7K adds 9% to this year’s returns for Visa.  

4. Be Patient but Not Greedy.   
I have learned the hard way from selling positions days before they pop that it can take a while before the market catches on to my investment idea, especially if using good tools. Asset managers, wealth managers, and passive investors are usually looking for new investments every 3 months, not daily, so stocks can stay stuck in a channel for some time before the world catches on to its awesomeness. Example, I held Upstart from April to August this year and sold it because it was running flat. A couple weeks later the stock tripled. FML were the only words I could think of at the time. The second thought I had was that I should’ve bought just one call option to replace the stock I sold.  
On the flip side, once a stock does move a lot higher, don’t be greedy. What goes up fast can come down just as fast. I feel a lot worse watching a stock/option go up 200% then come down all the way or more than I do exiting with a 100% gain watching the stock go up more. Don’t chase the perfect trade. It’s a white whale. Just make money.  

5. Everyone Has a Plan Until You Get Punched in the Mouth.   
This is as true in boxing (thanks Mike) as it is investing. That’s why it’s essential to have a plan A and a plan B should plan A not work out as you thought. Waiting through it can work, but it isn’t a very effective strategy for navigating a changing environment.   
So if my thesis is that the stock will do well with rising COVID rates and COVID rates stop rising, I try to have plan B ready. I keep a lot of notes. I track every trade. I review what went wrong with trades quarterly. I learn. I avoid the pity party as much as possible and drink vodka for the rest. I try not to fall in love with any stock. And I know that even if I lose 100K, there’s more money to be made in the coming years and decades if I stick it out.",11395,3418,Swingtrader79,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qi92fg/i_made_500000_trading_stocks_and_options_in_18/,qi92fg

Antitrust investigators are looking into the financial incentives that Visa gave Square Inc (SQ.N), Stripe Inc and Paypal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O), the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

Visa, which reported its quarterly results on Tuesday, declined to comment.

The company said earlier in March the Justice Department was looking at its debit practices after reports that the United States was investigating whether Visa uses anti-competitive practices in the debit-card market. read more

The Justice Department had previously investigated the credit card payments industry but settled with Visa and Mastercard Inc (MA.N) in 2010 when they agreed to allow merchants to offer consumers incentives to use a low-cost credit card.

&gt; Coca-Cola rose 2.6% premarket after the company posted a beat on the top and bottom lines and raised its outlook, saying the business was getting stronger particularly in areas where the Covid recovery has been the best.
*****
&gt; “This earnings season has been about pricing momentum and whether consumers are able to handle surging costs,” noted Ed Moya, senior analyst at Oanda. “So far it seems the consumer can handle it,” he added.
*****
&gt; So far roughly 30% of the S&amp;P 500 has reported earnings. Of the names that have posted quarterly updates, 82% have topped earnings expectations, while 80% have exceeded revenue estimates. Strong results have been key to pushing the major averages to new highs.
*****
&gt; “We see signs that there could be more gains to come in the final two months of the year,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial. “Seasonal tailwinds, improving market internals, and clear signs of a peak in the Delta variant all provide potential fuel for equities heading into year-end, and we maintain our overweight equities recommendation as a result.”
*****
&gt; Robinhood shares were getting slammed, down 11% the day after the trading app reported revenue well below expectations primarily due to weakness in trading.
*****
&gt; A busy earnings week continues on Wednesday with Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Bristol-Myers, Boeing, General Motors and Harley-Davidson among the names on deck before the market opens. Ford, eBay and Yum China will provide quarterly updates after the market closes.

2021-10-26 22:40:19,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, October 26, 2021"," 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, October 26, 2021**

Stocks extended gains, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) each reaching a fresh, intraday record high, as market participants continue to digest the stronger than anticipated corporate earnings season. The Nasdaq (QQQ) is within 1% of its record-high, driven primarily by extreme strength in Tesla (TSLA), which became the sixth company to break $1 trillion market cap, and NVIDIA (NVDA), my personal favorite company which beasted to new all-time highs today. 

Following September’s volatility, market participants have demonstrated their resilience and hunger to buy dips up despite ongoing supply-side disruptions and labor market imbalances, with new economic data showing consumer confidence increasing in October for the first time in four months. Investors continue to digest a massive week in regards to earnings, with mega-caps like AMD, Microsoft (MSFT), Visa (V), Alphabet (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN), among many others, reporting later this week.

The Conference Board, a non-profit business research organization, released their October monthly consumer confidence index, which showed confidence rising as coronavirus cases in the US continued to retreat from the latest spike. Cases in the US retreated from a high in the previous spike of 285,058 to 105,561 in between September 13 and October 25. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 113.8 in October from 109.8 in September. This came in higher than the 108.0 consensus economists were looking for, according to Bloomberg data. It also marked the first monthly increase in confidence since June.  

Lynn Franco, Senior Director of Economic Indicators at the Conference Board, said “Consumer confidence improved in October, reversing a three-month downward trend as concerns about the spread of the Delta variant eased. The proportion of consumers planning to purchase homes, automobiles, and major appliances all increased in October—a sign that consumer spending will continue to support economic growth through the final months of 2021."" As a reminder, consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP. 

[https://www.conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm](https://www.conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm)

Supporting this view, in the time from August to September, new home sales posted a far greater jump than expected by economists, according to a report released by The Department of Commerce. Sales were up 14.0% in September compared to August, far exceeding consensus expectations for a 2.2% rise, according to Bloomberg data. This brought new home sales to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 800,000, or the highest since March.

New home sales in the Northeast posted by far the biggest rise during the month, with these rising by 32.3%. This was followed by a 17.5% jump in new home sales in the South, and an 8.2% advance in the West. The Midwest region of the U.S. saw sales drop by 1.5% during the month.

I only selected companies I would want to add to my portfolio (or existing positions), and compared them to the Nasdaq composite.

* Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD)	35.47%
* **Nasdaq	 26.79%**
* Google ($GOOGL)	24.05%
* Microsoft($MSFT) 	15.22%

* Amazon ($AMZN) 	-2.28%
* Disney ($DIS)	-4.71%
* Mastercard ($MA)	-6.83%

Understanding that share price fluctuations are all relative, as a company could have a great run before the 6 months analysis, I'm curious if there's a way to interpret this data and view any of these as good opportunities to buy a supposed dip. For example, could you look at this data and think that now is a good time to purchase shares of Amazon and Mastercard, given their underperformance relative to the Nasdaq, or would you use this as an opportunity to buy more of AMD and Google to capitalize on their recent momentum?

Affirm operates a point-of-sale payment solution for consumers. Its payment network allows consumers to pay for purchases with an installment plan.

Affirm pays the merchant the full amount upfront. They charge an APR of 10 to 30 percent, depending on the plan and on the buyer’s credit. The Affirm app makes it easy for buyers to keep track of payments and sends reminders.

Affirm also receives a fee from merchants. Online sellers have found that point-of-sale financing increases sales volume and reduces cart abandonment, so they are willing to pay for the service.

There were over 12,000 active merchants using the Affirm platform in March 2021, more than double the number in the same quarter of 2020. Active consumers grew 60% to 5.4 million in the same period. Gross merchandise volume grew 83% to $2.3 billion.

Affirm has an exclusive relationship with Shopify ($SHOP), and provides point-of-sale financing to Shopify merchants.

Shopify is a leading competitor to Amazon. They are growing at a wild rate: gross merchandise volume was up 119% in the last reported quarter and the number of merchants with Shopify stores has been rising at 126% a year. Shopify now powers over 1.7 million businesses in more than 175 countries.

Affirm’s relationship with Shopify allows them to offer their services to an enormous and rapidly growing customer base.

**Why they’re spiking in interest:**

Reddit mentions of $AFRM in the last 8 days leaped 875% from the previous 8-day period.

The surge was kicked off by the August 3 news that Affirm will work with Apple ($AAPL) to provide installment plans for Apple device purchasers in Canada.

That announcement was followed on August 5 with news that Square ($SQ) is acquiring Australian buy-now-pay-later provider Afterpay for $29 billion. Affirm shares gained 18% on the combined news.

The Square/Afterpay combination will provide competition for Affirm, but it also brought attention to the sector.

There has been speculation that another major player seeking to move into the buy-now-pay-later space will acquire Affirm rather than develop their own system.

Shopify (which already owns 7.6% of Affirm), PayPal, and even card giants like Visa and Mastercard have been suggested as potentially interested in acquiring Affirm.

Notable comments from Reddit:

""I’m long on $AFRM. The financial sector is dinosaurs through and through. If you’ve ever applied for (and received) a mortgage, it’s a nightmare. It requires little imagination on my part for Affirm or “Green Sky” to open up to home and auto loans.""

\- PinBot1138

“People should probably get AFRM for when it gets acquired for a free 30%.”- Lukebreit

Signal: Over 77% of the $AFRM float is held by institutions. Scottish investment management firm Baillie Gifford is the largest institutional holder, with over $75 million worth of shares.

**Why $AFRM could be valuable:**

The buy-now-pay-later has enormous upward momentum. Sales have increased dramatically and the increase is expected to continue.

&amp;#x200B;

McKinsey &amp; Company’s annual POS Financing Survey found that about 60% of consumers are likely to use point-of-sale financing over the next six to 12 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Affirm founder and CEO Max Levchin has a record of developing successful and innovative payment systems: he’s one of the founders of PayPal.

&amp;#x200B;

Affirm does not charge late payment fees and has a fixed monthly payment system. This feature is attractive to users who are concerned with the complexities of credit card billing and payment.

&amp;#x200B;

Affirm’s Net Promoter Score - a measure of customer loyalty - places the company at 78, above Amazon and just below Apple. 64% of transactions are from repeat users, and repeat customers spend an average of $2,200 per year. Delinquency rates were just over 1% in 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

Six of 10 analysts covering the stock rate it “Buy”, with the other 4 placing it at “Hold”. The consensus price target is $76.71, 14% above the current level.

&amp;#x200B;

Rapid user growth, high customer retention, and a rapidly expanding market add up to very strong growth prospects for $AFRM.

&amp;#x200B;

The stock has dropped to under 50% of its post-IPO surge of $140 per share and has settled into a steady band in the $60-$70 range.

&amp;#x200B;

Post-IPO hype often drives new listings to unrealistic valuations. When they drop back to a more realistic level many retail investors become frustrated and drop out. That leaves a core of institutional holders and a strong base for appreciation of positive news.

&amp;#x200B;

**What the risks are:**

Affirm is not profitable and is not expected to achieve profitability soon. The Company also has a high debt/equity ratio of 87.95%. The Company has adequate working capital but the combination of debt and losses is still a concern.

Affirm operates in a highly competitive market. Right now that market is dominated by relatively new companies like Afterpay, and Klarna. The sector’s rapid growth could attract competition from larger companies with greater financial capacity than Affirm.

Affirm faces credit risk. Default rates have been extremely low, but unexpected events could drive them high enough to affect the Company’s results.

Affirm is exposed to a potential economic downturn. A recession could reduce the discretionary purchases that drive much of the Company’s gross merchandise volume and increase default rates.

The buy-now-pay-later sector could attract increased government regulation, which could affect the Company's results and stock price.

***Bottom line:*** *Affirm’s lack of profitability makes it a speculative play. But its rapid revenue growth and established position in an exploding market make it an interesting speculative play. There is strong potential for acquisition and for medium to long-term growth. Watch for the release of Q4 and full FY 2021 results, scheduled for Sept. 9.*

2021-08-30 19:46:44,r/stocks,Risky low priced stocks vs reliable stocks/index funds?,"Which is better long term risky low priced stocks or reliable stocks Microsoft, Visa, Facebook, etc/index funds. I recently looked up this one company I thought of investing in last year in JYNT and it was 18 a share and went up to 100 now, so if I put 10k I would have had 50k now. 

Instead, I stuck with my index funds and reliable stocks like the ones mentioned above. However, most of the other small company stocks do not rise in value and a majority of them are value traps. Most of the low priced stocks cost low for a reason and are often value traps. Especially since coronavirus it's hard to find a stock under $200 now. 

So, if I do see one under 200 I either assume the company is in decline, bad management, bad fundamentals, or the company is more volatile. Even if these small companies do rise they seem to have huge variances and even if it 3x in value today, next year it could go down by half. Whereas, Microsoft and index funds will rarely drop more than 5 points in a day. 

Is there a low percentage of hitting the jackpot on these low priced stocks, and is it more realistic to stick with more reliable stocks and index funds? Or is it better to focus on smaller stocks at lower prices?",14,9,ElectricOne55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pen66s/risky_low_priced_stocks_vs_reliable_stocksindex/,pen66s

2021-08-22 19:40:58,r/stocks,"Reality Check: Paysafe (PSFE) beats on revenue, reaffirms guidance, acquires three companies and drops 20% to 3.85X P/S","Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.

Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%.  But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech.

Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.”

To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion.  They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs \~ $105 billion)

So why the miss?  Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation.

The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%.

Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news.  On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news:

&amp;#x200B;

* Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion
* Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA
* Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million
* Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus.
* 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter)
* 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture)
* 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV)
* Revenue growth in all segments
* eCash revenue +37% YoY  (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries)
* North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY
* Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits)
* Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance
* Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs
* Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage.
* Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring &amp; E-commerce

&amp;#x200B;

Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.”  Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.)

With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America.

Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost.  Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.”

This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV.  Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1.

Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.”

These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&amp;A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.”

&amp;#x200B;

Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality.  In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance.  Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted.

&amp;#x200B;

Paysafe vs PayPal

Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine.""  The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal.

In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow,  Paysafe’s share price would be $32.  A 4x gain from current levels.

&amp;#x200B;

Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider:

1. PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.)  On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY.  With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe.  Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news.
2. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces.
3. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth.
4. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR).
5. PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%.
6. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60
7. Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40.
8. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt).  During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR.

* By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR.
* Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%.

&amp;#x200B;

There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32.

&amp;#x200B;

# Some Background:

Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing.

As an integrated back-end payment processor, most don’t realize they are using Paysafe’s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.  Within the industry, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.”

Paysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.”

Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews).

By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews).

Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.

&amp;#x200B;

MOAT:

Paysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its “robust risk management.” Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter.

CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.”

“We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.”

&amp;#x200B;

iGaming Expansion

Paysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape.

Importantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.”

In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage.

As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.""

He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting”

Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.”

Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,”

Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”:

* ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering""
* ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature""
* “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign""
* ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting""
* ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting""
* “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL""
* “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year”
* “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling”
* “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting”

* “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools”
* “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal”
* “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think”
* “Canada legalizes single-game sports betting” (Paysafe is market leader in Canada)

&amp;#x200B;

Consistent Value Creation:

Fintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares).

The current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors.  In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.

Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit.

M&amp;A / inorganic growth:

Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&amp;A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.”

Inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge.  Foley is a known M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).

Through his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.”

Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.”

&amp;#x200B;

Valuation Metrics:

Above I compared Paysafe with PayPal.  A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.

\- Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow.

\- By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.

\- Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.

The group's collective growth rate of \~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming.

Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels.  In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth  But even if you include 2020’s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s growth.

Given all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:

Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples:

* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09
* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91
* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

&amp;#x200B;

More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100

* EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75
* EV/Rev ratio : $44.64
* EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average : $46.52

In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not investment advice.  Just a collection of observations.  If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

2021-08-17 22:29:08,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, August 17, 2021"," 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, August 17, 2021**

Stocks fell firmly on Tuesday, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones retreating from record levels yesterday amid a mixed batch of earnings results from major retailers and new economic data regarding retail sales. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting to hear from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who is scheduled to speak later this week. Market participants will be waiting to see if there is any new information regarding a potential taper timeline. 

Shares of Dow component Walmart (WMT) fell even after the big-box retailer posted second-quarter results that blew past estimates and raised its full-year guidance. Stimulus check spending, strong grocery demand and e-commerce sales helped push U.S. comparable sales excluding gas up by 5.5%, topping estimates but still slowing from last year's 9.9% surge. Home Depot (HD), meanwhile, missed on comparable sales for the second quarter, with these rising 4.5%, way below consensus estimates of a 5.5% increase. 

According to the Department of Commerce, for the month of July, retail sales in the US fell 1.1%, much higher than the drop of 0.3% expected and below the 0.7% increase in June, a sign that economic activity is slowing down, likely to the surge in the coronavirus delta variant and government stimulus drying up. Consumer spending makes up nearly 70% of US GDP, so market participants closely track these reports. 

China released economic data for July that showed growth rates slow down dramatically as the world’s second largest economy battles with summer flooding and the resurgence of coronavirus thanks to the highly contagious delta variant. Industrial production, a gauge of activity in the manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors, grew by 6.4% year-over-year in July, a sharp deceleration from the 8.3% rise in June and below the 7.9% growth expected. Retail sales, a key measurement of consumer sentiment in the world’s most populous nation, grew by 8.5% in July, way below the 12.1% increase in June and missing the 11.5% expected by economists. 

The National Bureau of Statistics noted “the impact of multiple factors including the growing external uncertainties and the domestic COVID-19 epidemic and flooding situation,” according to a release. The bureau added that the “economic recovery is still unstable and uneven.”

Looking ahead, market participants are set to receive the Federal Open Market Committee's July meeting minutes (which are basically notes of what was discussed) on Wednesday, offering more context around how much more amenable central bank officials have become to the notion of tapering their crisis-era asset purchases as the economic recovery takes place. As I have said in the past, I wouldn’t be surprised if there is more discussion about a potential timeline to begin tapering quantitative analysis, though I remain unconcerned. While the markets may react negatively, the real test will be in 2022 when discussions of raising the interest rates are brought to the table.

* The world's largest nonfinancial companies had a record $6.85 trillion in cash on their balance sheets as of the end of the second quarter, according to data from S&amp;P Global Ratings.

2021-08-01 17:52:03,r/stocks,How Stocks Are Valued Part 2: Relative Value,"In my last post, I went over how to value stocks based on the discounted cash flow of a company. If you haven't read it yet, [start here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o8ygn4/how_stocks_are_valued_part_1_discounted_cash_flow/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) This post will go over ***relative valuation***, rather than the absolute value of a company.

# Comparables

When you're buying a house, how do you determine what the fair value of the house is? Appraisers often look at similar homes in the neighborhood to get an idea of how much the house should be worth.

If the house on 123 Potato Street were similar to all the other houses on Potato Street but was selling for 20% more than the average, odds are it's not going to sell. This concept of comparing assets to similar assets also applies in stock valuation.

# How Do We Compare Stocks?

Remember that stocks just represent a fraction of a company's future earnings. For similar companies with similar industries, earnings, and, $1 in earnings for company A should be worth the same as $1 of earnings for company B.

A lemonade stand that makes $10 on Potato Street should be worth about the same to an investor as a lemonade stand that makes $10 somewhere else in the same neighborhood. If one is valued at $100 and the other at $120, the first lemonade stand might be undervalued.

There are several metrics we can use to compare stocks. Some ratios include:

1. Price to Earnings (P/E). This ratio is calculated by dividing the stock price by its earnings per share. For example, WFC and BAC are (at a glance) similar companies since they're both in the same industry. It makes sense that they have similar P/E ratios, with WFC at 13.16 and BAC at 12.83. However, we see that BAC is relatively cheaper as we pay less for each dollar of earnings compared to WFC.
2. The Enterprise Multiple (EV/EBITDA). This ratio measures the enterprise value (market cap + debt - cash) compared to a company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. This is an alternative to the P/E ratio but takes into consideration more than just equity holders, and adjust for capital structure, taxes, etc.
3. Price to Earnings Growth (PEG). This ratio measures the stock price as a ratio to the company's earnings growth (typically over the next 1-3 years). This ratio is calculated as the P/E divided by the earnings growth rate. For example, if AAPL has a P/E of 28.3x and a growth rate of 1.3%, AAPL has a PEG of 22.6x. MSFT has a higher P/E (35.09x), but because of its higher growth rate of 8.9%, has a much lower PEG of 3.92x.

We can use these ratios (and others) to identify whether stocks are relatively undervalued compared to other similar stocks, or we can compare stocks to the industry average. If we buy companies that are relatively cheaper compared to their peers, we should (in theory) perform better over time.

# Short Term Relative Value Trading Strategies

We can also make relative value trades in the short term.

A common retail trader’s strategy is to buy a stock for a few days or a few weeks, hoping to scalp a few dollars and turn a profit. However, what if the market drops? Your stock could outperform the market by only falling 3% while the market falls by 10%. You were right but you still lost money due to your market exposure.

Hedge funds also bet on stocks, except instead of looking for a return on a single stock, they bet on stocks going up or down relative to another. They buy stock A and short-sell stock B, hoping A will outperform B. This is aptly named the Long-Short trading strategy or the pairs trade. If A falls 3% but B drops 5%, the hedge fund makes money overall.

# Short Term Relative Value Trade Examples

How can we apply this to our trading? What if we think GME will outperform AMC? At $161 its may or may not be a good idea to be strictly long GME. However, we can hedge by shorting AMC. If all meme stocks crash, we still make money as long as GME doesn’t fall as much as AMC does. If GameStop stays flat, we make money when AMC falls. (Of course, if you think AMC is the winner you can just inverse the above strategy)

We can apply this strategy to stocks in similar industries such as GM/Ford, Visa/Mastercard, and Coke/Pepsi.

A second example would be a pairs trade I closed earlier last week.

Google has two classes of (publicly traded) shares: GOOGL (Class A) which has voting rights, and GOOG (Class C) which has none.

Theoretically, GOOGL should always be more expensive because they have voting rights, but because Alphabet is conducting share buybacks of GOOG exclusively, GOOGL was cheaper for a while - [We can see this in the trading view chart here.](https://imgur.com/a/Qng5vyG)

By buying GOOGL and shorting GOOG, I’m betting the gap between the two stocks will close. I don’t care if the market rises, falls, or goes sideways. I don’t even care if google falls 50%. The only thing I’m betting on is that GOOGL will be the same price as GOOG eventually, and after Alphabet announced it would start buybacks of both share classes, the gap closed.",110,22,ArchegosRiskManager,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ovuksb/how_stocks_are_valued_part_2_relative_value/,ovuksb
2021-07-28 22:31:04,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, July 28, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, July 28, 2021**

The market staged another remarkable reversal today, with many names that were hit yesterday clawing back their losses. The three major indexes were mixed, with Nasdaq (QQQ) climbing 0.35%. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) dipped towards the end of the session to close 0.6%  down. The Dow Jones (DIA), which tracks industrial and financial stocks, fell 0.37%. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed, rising 1.53% at the time of writing. Just like last Monday, today demonstrates that, while there are risks present in the market, investors and traders remain eager to buy up every dip.

Today, market participants continue to digest a slew of earnings reports, with three of the largest companies in the market, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) reporting yesterday. Today, after-hours, Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL) are reporting, among many others. 

Moreover, market participants also eyed the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) July Monetary Policy Report, which largely reiterated what members of the Fed have been saying for months, but did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Fed’s stated goals. The statement read, “Last December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings.” In other words, the Fed says substantial progress has been made and that in the coming months, we will increasingly begin to hear more about a timeline to taper quantitative easing. 

On inflation, the statement largely reiterated what it has in months past. The statement read, “Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses” and “The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer‑term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved.”

However, the report did acknowledge potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if “appropriate risks arise”. The statement read, “In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.”

Shares of Facebook (FB) fell 5% after-hours despite largely beating analyst after the company warned of a significant slowdown moving forward. Here are the numbers.

* **Earnings:** $3.61 per share, adjusted, vs. $3.03 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.
* **Revenue:** $29.08 billion, vs. $27.89 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.
* **Daily active users (DAUs):** 1.91 billion, vs. 1.91 billion as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.
* **Monthly active users (MAUs):** 2.90 billion, vs. 2.91 billion as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.
* **Average revenue per user (ARPU):** $10.12, vs. $9.66 as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.

Importantly, however, with respect to guidance, Facebook warned of a significant deceleration in growth moving forward. The company said it expects “year-over-year total revenue growth rates to decelerate significantly on a sequential basis as we lap periods of increasingly strong growth.”

**Highlights**

* Twitter (TWTR) stock surged roughly 5% before moderating after the company announced it was testing a new feature called the “Shop Module” that would enable businesses to sell their products directly through the Twitter platform. 
* Quarterly revenue for LinkedIn, the professional social network owned by tech giant Microsoft, surpassed $1 billion in the quarter for the first time.
* Youtube, which is owned by Alphabet, reported revenues of $7 billion for the quarter. To put into context how massive YouTube really is, Netflix (NFLX) had $7.3 billion in revenue this quarter, which has a $230 billion market-cap. It’s funny, in a world where the competition between streaming services for professional content is becoming increasingly more saturated, YouTube is poised to become and doesn’t spend billions to produce and acquire content. 
* Shares of chip-maker AMD gapped up today after the company beat earnings estimates and raised guidance moving forward that suggests the company will continue to take market share away from Intel. As I’ve said before, I think AMD and NVDA are the kings of this space.

&amp;#x200B;

S&amp;P500, NASDAQ, and Dow are about 1% from its highs while the Russell Index is about 5%. All indices are way off its lows from 52 weeks ago (even more so from the bottom of the 2020 cash). Clearly the indices are doing ok. But what about the stocks in the S&amp;P500?

In this next chart, here's the value companies in the S&amp;P500 have made since 52 weeks ago (again, the gains should be much more than this since the 2020 lows).

**Marketcap valuation gained during the last 52 weeks**

|%|13.86%|3.73%|1.63%|0.44%|0.19%|0.06%|

The total value gained in the S&amp;P500 index since one year ago is $20.93 trillion! The top 5 companies contributed to about 24% of those gains and the top 250 companies contributed to basically all of it (\~86%).

As of right now, the S&amp;P500 index is now valued at $39.38 trillion, so the S&amp;P500 index has doubled in value since a year ago which is absolutely insane. Let's look at the valuations of these companies.

**Valuations of companies right now**

Top 10 includes Tesla, which is about 25% off its highs that's why you see the top 10 is -12% off its highs. Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index. The top 250 aren't doing so bad either. After that, the bottom 250 gets a bit ugly. The smaller caps did gain more overall up until their highs before they retreated.

Now let's look at how much carrying the top companies are doing.

Every 1% move Apple makes as of now, \~$24 is moved and the S&amp;P500 index moved \~0.06%. A 3% move would impact $72 billion dollars in valuation and has a 0.18% impact on the index. Doesn't seem much but the index is valued at almost $40 trillion dollars. Look at how much of an impact these stocks together make.

&amp;#x200B;

||1% move|2% move|3% move|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Top 5|0.23%|0.46%|0.69%|
|Top 10|0.3%|0.6%|0.9%|
|Top 20|0.391%|0.78%|1.17%|

The top 20 companies can make a 1%+ move if they averaged a 3% increase/decrease.

So what should I get out of this?

* The S&amp;P500 is top heavy - 23% of its valuation comes from the top 5 companies. 55% of its valuation from the top 50 companies. Almost 90% from the top 250 companies.
* S&amp;P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them.
* Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD.
* Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down.
* Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season.

2021-07-15 22:31:44,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, July 15, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, July 15, 2021**

Stocks broadly fell today as market participants continued digesting Q2 earning reports, reassurances from the Federal Reserve that current inflationary pressures is temporary and new economic reports that suggest a slowdown in the global growth rate. After recording several new intraday highs this week, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) slipped, closing 0.34% and 0.7% down respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM) fell for the third straight day this week, closing 0.54% down.

Markets seem to have become jittery following the release of the June Consumer and Producer Price Index (CPI &amp; PPI). (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May’s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year’s pandemic-era lows. PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 1% in June, accelerating to a 7.3% rise year-on-year, while still reflecting base effects. Core PPI rse 5.5%. This is the fastest rate of increase since 2009.

Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave his semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress, where he largely reiterated the same thing he has been saying for months. Powell said “inflation will likely remain elevated in the coming months before moderating” and that the US economy was “still a ways” off from reaching the threshold of “substantial further progress” that would trigger the Central Bank to roll-back pandemic-era policies. In short, Powell basically said while he expects higher inflation prints in the coming months, pressures are transitory and due to pandemic era disruptions and the Fed’s goal for economic recovery have not been met. [Here is Powell’s complete testimony, but here are two of his most important quotes.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20210714a.htm)

**On the labor market:** “Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.”

**On inflation:** “Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy”.

In other news, new economic data coming out of China, the first country to experience and begin recovering from the virus, is showing a marked slowdown in economic growth. The world's second largest economy expanded at a 7.9% rate in the second quarter from a year ago, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, missing consensus estimates for an 8.0% rise and decelerating sharply from the first quarter's 18.3% increase. In response, the People’s Bank of China signalled it was cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, a move that suggests the economic recovery in China may be slowing down. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) will reduce the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage point for most banks, according to a [statement](http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4287599/index.html) published Friday. That will unleash about 1 trillion yuan ($154 billion) of long-term liquidity into the economy and will be effective on July 15, the central bank said. The reduction was signaled earlier this week, when the State Council, China’s equivalent of a cabinet, hinted the central bank would make more liquidity available to banks so they could lend to smaller firms hurt by rising costs. The timing and magnitude of the move, coming a week before second-quarter growth data, suggests worries about the economy’s outlook and was a decisive shift away from policy tightening, which most, if not all, recovering economies are pursuing.  Just to put into more familiar terms, this would be like if the Federal Reserve suddenly turned around and said rather than discussing tapering quantitative easing, it would instead propose pumping more money into the economy.

In good news, the Weekly Unemployment Report showed new jobless claims fall to pandemic-era lows. 

* **Initial jobless claims, week ended July 10:** 360,000 vs. 350,000 expected and a revised 386,000 during prior week 
* **Continuing claims, week ended July 3:** 3.241 million vs. 3.300 million expected and a revised 3.367 million during prior week

**Highlights** 

* Import prices were up 1% in June over May, adding to a 1.4% increase the month prior. This marks the eighth straight month import prices have risen and brings the annual price increase to 11.2%
* Netflix (NFLX) has announced it plans to eventually stream video games on its platform and hired a former Electronic Arts (EA) executive to lead the push. 
* As earnings season continues, big bank stocks continue falling despite, in most cases, posting great earnings. 
* Square (SQ) announced it has acquired Crew, and app that enables real-time access to communicate with frontline hourly workers and assist with scheduling and other managerial services.
* According to Facebook (FB), the company is pledging $1 billion to support content creators on its platforms through the end of 2022. Content creators will receive a monthly bonus if they hit milestones for earnings Stars, a form of digital tipping that fans can use to pay their favorite creators during live-streamed videos. Instagram's bonus programs will include incentives to use Reels, its copycat TikTok feature that showcases short-form video clips. Creators will earn money based on how their Reels videos perform, the company said.
* Microsoft (MSFT) is betting hybrid work will provide an opening to make its Windows operating system more widespread, launching a new service aimed at getting users of Apple (AAPL) and Android products to use the software. Windows 365, the company said, will be accessible on any device running any operating system that has a web browser, such as Apple Mac computers, iPhones and iPads, or those running Android software made by Alphabet (GOOGL)

The stock market pulled a remarkable turnaround today, shaking off yesterday’s declines with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) rocketing to another record intraday high, led by the financial and energy sectors, which had been lagging as of late and continued strength in mega-cap tech stocks. It seems that after a brief flare-up of concerns regarding the coronavirus delta variant and a potential acceleration of the timeline to taper quantitative easing in the US, fears have greatly tempered. At the time of writing, the Dow Jones (DIA) rose 1.27% while the Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 0.6% and is very slightly below it’s all-time high. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, led the day, rising more than 2%.

In recent weeks, market participants are increasingly trying to gauge if the surge we are seeing in the more contagious coronavirus delta variant will weigh on global growth rates. Yesterday, it seems concerns came to a head after the Japanese government made a last minute announcement that a state of emergency would be re-instituted across Tokyo and that all events would take place behind closed doors, with no spectators, walking back an earlier decision to allow locals to attend the games. The state of emergency will begin on Monday and run through Aug. 22, while the games are scheduled from July 23 to Aug. 8. On Wednesday, 16 days before the Opening Ceremony, the [Tokyo Metropolitan Government reported 920 COVID cases](https://stopcovid19.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/en), over 200 more than any other single-day total since May. On Thursday, it reported 896, the second-highest count since May. Other countries, like India and Brazil, are also dealing with an extremely worrying surge of cases. Even in the US, where roughly 50% of those eligible are fully vaccinated, the country is seeing a small surge in cases recently, with the delta variant accounting for 51.7% of all new infections, according to the CDC. According to reports, as of yesterday, only 16.8% of the Japanese population was vaccinated against the virus. 

In other news, in another move that raised concerns about the global growth rate, China’s central bank signalled it will be cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, a move that suggests the economic recovery in China may be slowing down. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) will reduce the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage points for most banks, according to a [statement](http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4287599/index.html) published Friday. That will unleash about 1 trillion yuan ($154 billion) of long-term liquidity into the economy and will be effective on July 15, the central bank said. The reduction was signaled earlier this week, when the State Council, China’s equivalent of a cabinet, hinted the central bank would make more liquidity available to banks so they could lend to smaller firms hurt by rising costs. The timing and magnitude of the move, coming a week before second-quarter growth data, suggests worries about the economy’s outlook and was a decisive shift away from policy tightening, which most, if not all, recovering economies are pursuing.

Ken Cheung, Chief Asian Foreign Exchange Strategist at Mizuho, said “The PBOC came in broader and sooner than expected, highlighting the policy urgency to support the Chinese economy. Such firm easing measures could further fuel concern over China’s growth outlook in the second half as well as the upcoming Q2 GDP figures in the coming week”. Just to put into more familiar terms, this would be like if the Federal Reserve suddenly turned around and said rather than discussing tapering quantitative easing, it would instead propose pumping more money into the economy.

While these global concerns did jitter the market yesterday, the impressive recovery in US equities underscores the remarkable strength of its economy, as the country continues reopening thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, with 48% of the population fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. In my opinion, while the delta variant does pose a risk to global growth rates, and the market may react negatively to headlines about it, the foundations of the recovery in the US (i.e nation-wide reopening measures, a rapidly improving labor market, record earnings from companies, and a high level of savings among Americans) are very strong and will continue to underpin a bull market here. 

**Highlights** 

* The recent sell-off in crude oil recovered, with the West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settling higher by 2.2% to $74.56 per barrel at the time of writing.
* Apple (AAPL), the largest company in the world, reached a new all-time high today. 
* President Biden is expected to sign an executive agreement ordering the Federal Trade Commission to limit or ban noncompete agreements, unnecessary occupational licenses, and revise guidance for sharing wage information between the HR department and workers and other employers. 
* Tesla (TSLA), Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) said Friday they would work together on a new initiative to create the nation's most sustainable residential community. The companies said the provisionally named SunHouse at Easton Park in Austin, Texas, would be the first Tesla Solar neighborhood.
* On Monday, a trial will kick off in the Court of Chancery in Wilmington, Delaware between Elon Musk and shareholders. The plaintiffs alleged that Musk used his control at Tesla to force the company to buy SolarCity for $2.6 billion in order to protect his investment in the company from bankruptcy and want Musk to pay that money back to Tesla. IMO seems a little weird to me to sue about this given that SolarCity has proven to be a good acquisition for Tesla.
* Apple (AAPL) is reportedly in early talks with the NFL to buy the rights to stream Sunday Night games for their streaming service. A while ago, Amazon (AMZN) bought the right to stream Thursday NFL games for Prime Video. 
* Marvel’s “Black Widow, opened in theaters last night and is expected to be the biggest opening since 2019, with the film projected to bring around $80 million domestically. This is huge and a sign that Americans' appetite to go to movie-theaters is very real. Personally, I’m going to go watch in the theaters this weekend. 
* Foxconn, a well known supplier for Apple, is discussing plans with Fisker (FSR) to open a factory to build EV’s in Wisconsin. In a statement, the company said, “Foxconn has engaged the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) to discuss the company's plans for electric vehicle manufacturing.

2021-06-24 10:40:33,r/stocks,Visa to buy Swedish fintech Tink for $2.2 billion,"Visa Inc said on Thursday it had agreed a 1.8 billion euro ($2.2 billion) takeover of European open banking platform Tink, months after it ditched a planned acquisition of the startup's U.S. rival Plaid.

Founded in 2012, Sweden-based Tink enables banks and other financial firms to access consumer financial data more easily. It is used by more than 3,400 banks and other institutions, as well as over 250 million customers across Europe.

Visa was forced to terminate a planned $5.3 billion deal with U.S. data-sharing platform Plaid in January, following a U.S. government lawsuit aimed at blocking the deal on antitrust grounds.

Visa said the Tink deal was subject to regulatory approvals.

European Union rules on open banking, also adopted by Britain before it left the bloc, require banks to allow access to customer data by registered third party providers to boost competition.

The rollout of the rules has provided fertile ground for fintechs, such as Tink, which provide technology to help third parties and banks to access customer data.

Visa would retain Tink's brand and management team, and its headquarters would stay in Stockholm, the company said.

The Tink takeover included cash and retention incentives, Visa said, adding the deal would have no impact on its previously announced stock buyback or dividend policy.

2021-06-24 07:08:49,r/stocks,Doximity IPO prices at $26 (above initial range of $20 - $23 a share),"(Crossposted and slightly modified due to audience, from r/residents as DOCS was being offered to physicians)

I'm a new here but since I see some posts about it, might as well start with this.

I'm a physician in California, 20 years out from residency.

I've been investing with my Stafford Loan $ since MS I and endured several serious market crashes. I enjoy doing financial analysis and have successfully invested in multiple IPOs in the past, including google, mastercard, visa, interactive brokers, and evercore financial. I still HODL GOOG, MA, and V; sold EVR at a modest profit and roughly broke even on IBKR.

This is completely divorced from what I think about the app or the company (I don't like the fax function, don't usually read its articles, and primarily use it so that when I call patients they can't see my mobile #), I am focusing purely on the financials reported by the company. I would be interested in seeing if anyone else has picked up anything that I have blind spots for and cannot see. Thanks in advance.

**tl;dr**: DOCS hits every thing I want to see in (any) company going public. I committed a full 250 share allotment on Fidelity after I had passed on an opportunity to purchase pre-IPO shares through EquityZen

**First.** The [S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001516513/000162828021011269/doximity-sx1.htm) filing is located here.

**Second,** Their financials. For any company you want to look at:

* Revenue (also called 'top line')
* Operating Expenses
* Profit (also called 'bottom line') which is more or less revenue - expenses
* Cash on hand
* Debt
* Why they are going IPO

You want to see that the company is making money both top line and bottom line, you want to see that their costs are not outstripping their revenue and profit growth. **When you are investing in a stock, you are basically laying an (educated) bet that the company will grow their profits. When they grow, your stock grows.**

For the last bullet, you want to see that they have money so that they won't go bankrupt. Generally for why IPO, if the prospectus says, ""to pay back debt"" or ""the company will not receive any proceeds"" then stay the hell away. You want the company to use the money they raise to fund new ventures or anything that will help them grow.

So, under the hood (and very simplified):

&amp;#x200B;

||2019|2020|2021|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenues|85.7mm|116.4mm (+30.7%)|206.9mm (+78%)|
|Expenses|67.9mm|79.3mm (+16.8%)|122.4mm (+54.3%)|
|Profit|7.8mm|23.5mm (+201%)|57.7mm (+145%)|

What do we see:

* Increasing rate of change growth in revenue from 2019 -&gt; 2020, and 2020 -&gt; 2021
* Increasing expenses but rate of change is not as much as rate of change of revenues
* Profit every year. Though 2020 - 2021 growth is not as much as 2019 - 2020, it's still more than doubled

DOCS has 142mm in cash on hand, and the only ""debt"" they have is in the form of convertible preferred stock - i.e. no loans taken out.

Why are they IPOing? They are going to use the funds to support growth and investments in the business, or to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or assets.

**In Summary**.

Solely from a financial perspective, the company grows revenues and profits year over year. Their expenses are growing but not as rapidly - plus if you dive into their S-1 they have a significant portion of those expenses used for research and development, which in my mind is actually not an expense but more of an investment in their future. They have cash on hand and no debt. It's a slam dunk and I am not surprised that the IPO priced 3 dollars above their upper range because everyone with financial know how and the ability to get their hands on the stock wanted it.

Cheers and best wishes.

I know that this is just one organization’s opinion but Zacks also moved them from “buy” to “hold”. Very odd given the increased amount of spending and inflation. Strangely inflation helps the Visa/MasterCard/AMEX of the worst because they make that much more on transactional fees.

2021-05-21 12:49:04,r/stocks,Is it worth it to invest in multiple shares of Coca Cola for Dividends?,"I am a new investor and while I am learning more every day and looking into stuff more and more, Coca Cola has caught my eye. Basically, coca cola (I'll just say KO for now on) was shown to have a div/yield of around 3. On top of that, KO isn't going anywhere any time soon, and even though it's a gigantic thing, it's only at around 54 dollars per share. I'm thinking of buying a bit more shares of this than I normally would, around 19-20 or so, so I can get a decent amount of dividends and put those back into investing. Plus they pay out dividends very soon about next month, and quarterly at that. I have tried to play it as intelligently as I could, and if something may seem dumb, to me it made logical sense. I've mostly been investing in ETF's, with only Visa being my one blue chip company. I was wondering if it would be wise to then buy a few of KO as my next blue chip company, and buy more for the dividends aspect too. I do not want to invest in random stuff like the rip-toe currency stuff (can't say it because word filters are stupid), and I just want to be a long term investor. So again, as intelligently as I could think

My comparison, my portfolio right now is:  
2.51 shares of VOO (Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF)  
3.02 shares of V (Visa)  
1.05 Shares of SPY (SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF)  
2.53 shares of VTV (Vanguard Value ETF)  
(I plan on buying a few shares of KO but here's where I come to ask if it's worth it to buy more, around 19-20 or just buy a few like I did with the others)

2021-05-12 11:06:21,r/stocks,Stock advice long term in army,"Hey Reddit I usually lurk around here looking at discussions of certain stocks I'm thinking of investing it but I am in a special circumstance. I'm turning 18 in a month or so and am getting about 2500$ from a trustfund I also have around 1300$ in hand. I will be taking part in the army for 2.5 years so I thought I should invest the money so it can grow and pull it out at 25 or so so I have a good financial base to start with. I've been studying ETFs and individual stocks but have been hearing about a market crash from a lot of sources recently and also I've been looking at crypto since it's booming rn and isn't connected directly to the stock market. I understand that long term investments mean that you shouldn't be too worried about market dips.
 
since Im probably going to be in for around 7 years I'm afraid the crash will affect me more since I don't have too much time to let the market recover but at the same time Might be waiting too long for a crash that wouldn't happen and miss the bull run gains. Is now a good time to get in? Should I wait for the crash and buy low or take the risk and get in now? I'm relatively new to the stock scene but have been studying the market for a few months, what do you think is the best option for me to invest in right now? (I am also contemplating between buying a few picked diverse stocks, a good ETF and dividend Vs growth).

2021-05-10 10:35:04,r/stocks,"PSFE (Paysafe): A better way to bet on multiple high growth companies like DRAFTKINGS, BARSTOOL, FORTNITE, TWITCH, YOUTUBE, SPOTIFY, ETC.","Paysafe is one hell of a company. They are a fin-tech like PayPal and Squares, thus should be given a higher multiple for valuation. They got a lot of exciting and growth customers/partners like Barstool (PENN), YouTube (Google), Twitch (AMZN), FanDuel (PDYPY), Roblox (RBLX), CoinBase (COIN), Visa (V), ApplePay (APPL), BetMGM (MGM), Spotify (SPOT), Microsoft/Xbox etc., and on top of that they got a huge digital wallet (#2 in market share) where you can trade/buy the fast-growing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoins. I truly believed this Paysafe is undervalued compared to its peers. You can read a very good Paysafe DD below on reddit and it gives a lot of insight of Paysafe valuation and bear cases:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mysz54/reviewing\_the\_bear\_case\_on\_paysafe\_psfe/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mysz54/reviewing_the_bear_case_on_paysafe_psfe/)

(the link above is a really really good read with lots of info about Paysafe including discussion of bear cases, so I’m not going to repeat most of the good points the author mentioned in that sub.)

Most of the time analysis use assumptions to make predictions on future growth. As an example, EV-related stocks (PLUG, BLNK, QS, LAZR, NKLA, BLDP, etc) get higher or ridiculous valuation based on assumption that gasoline cars will eventually be phased out. As you can see most if not all of these companies are unprofitable and some don’t even have revenue, yet worth billions. While this assumption may be accurate, it is extremely hard to know when will growth begin to accelerate. Because of this predictive nature, it’s really hard to know how long you will have to hold onto the stocks before they pop. When or if it will pop is anyone's guess. So while holding onto these stocks will likely result in wild price swings thus high risk / high rewards.

But what if you have the data before you showing the financial growth of your customers or partners? If your customers/partners' revenue grows, it’s more likely than not they are using more of your products or services. Paysafe is one such company where you can actually look at their customers/partners' financial reports to predict where the company will go in the future and when growth will start. For this reason, Paysafe is more of a lower risk but still has high reward potential.

Paysafe will be reporting earning for the very first time as a public company again on May 11. The good news is we already have their customers results in and here are some breakdown of their 1st QTR results showing huge growth:

1. PENN (Reported May 7, 2021) - “Penn National’s income from operations rose to $216.5 million in the first quarter against ($560.6) million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDAR jumped 77.2% from the year-ago quarter to $447 million. Moreover, adjusted EBITDAR margin expanded to 35.1% from 22.6% a year ago.” ( source: [https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1515673/penn-national-penn-q1-earnings-revenues-beat-estimates](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1515673/penn-national-penn-q1-earnings-revenues-beat-estimates) )
2. DraftKing ( Reported May 7, 2021) - “DraftKings is raising its fiscal year 2021 revenue guidance from a range of $900 million to $1 billion to a range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, which equates to year-over-year growth of 63% to 79% and a 16% increase compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance”

3. Spotify (April 28th, 2021)- “Revenue increased 16% to €2.15 billion ($2.6 billion) from €1.85 billion ($2.22 billion) in the same period last year….” (source: [https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9564180/spotify-q1-2021-earnings-report/](https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9564180/spotify-q1-2021-earnings-report/))

4. Youtube/Google ( April 27th, 2021 ) - “ In its first-quarter earnings report Tuesday, Google parent company [Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL) said YouTube [brought in](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/alphabet-goog-earnings-q1-2021.html) revenue of $6.01 billion in advertising revenue during the quarter — up from $4 billion from a year ago, for a growth rate of 49%. That’s an acceleration over its 46% growth in Q4. It’s also nearly twice the growth rate of Netflix, which reported 24% revenue growth [in Q1](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/20/netflix-nflx-q1-2021-earnings.html), and [expects](https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/FINAL-Q1-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf) growth to slow to 19% next quarter.” (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/youtube-could-soon-equal-netflix-in-revenue.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/youtube-could-soon-equal-netflix-in-revenue.html) )

5. Skillz ( May 4, 2021 ) - “Revenue grew to $83.7 million during the first quarter of 2021, up 92% over the prior year. Gross profit grew to $79.4 million during the first quarter of 2021, up 95% over the prior year.” (source: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210504006307/en/CORRECTING-and-REPLACING-Skillz-Reports-Record-Q1-Revenue-and-Raises-2021-Guidance](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210504006307/en/CORRECTING-and-REPLACING-Skillz-Reports-Record-Q1-Revenue-and-Raises-2021-Guidance) )

As you can see these Paysafe’s customers/partners are reporting explosive growth. While some of these companies may report an earning loss it may be due to higher expenses such as customers acquisition cost (i.e. Draftking). However, here we are more focused on their revenue as the more transactions they do the more likely all or part of that transaction is done by Paysafe. These companies reported earnings before Paysafe, so it can be highly expected Paysafe will report a very good earning and future growth projection tomorrow ( May 11).

Several things to note about Paysafe besides their customer’s earning growth. These factors will also influence Paysafe’s future growth:

1. They are a monopoly when it comes to iGaming/Sport Betting as you can see the explosive growth by DKNG, MGM, PENN, SKLZ, etc.
2. Paysafe took a hit during the pandemic because they also do offline transaction processing, but now things are opening up we can expect going forward these offline transactions will grow again. Also, when re-opening occur, more sport events will occur thus more betting means more transactions for Paysafe.
3. They are #2 in digital wallets and you can buy digital currency with the wallet. These currency has been generating huge revenue for PayPal and SQ (more on this below)

Finally, both PayPal and SQ reported earning before Paysafe and their results beat estimation:

Paypal earning ( May 5, 2021) “ Revenue: $6.03 billion vs. $5.90 billion expected by Refinitiv” (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/paypal-pypl-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/paypal-pypl-earnings-q1-2021.html) )

Square earning ( May 6, 2021 ) “Square reported a profit of 41 cents per share vs. 16 cents per share expected in a Refinitiv survey of analysts. It also brought in $5.06 billion of revenue vs. $3.36 billion expected by Refinitiv.” ( source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/square-sq-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/square-sq-earnings-q1-2021.html))

So I can say with confidence Paysafe will likely beat their own guidance for Q1 on May 11th. For those of you who don’t know Paysafe, they are not a small player. Their transaction volume is about that of SQ \~$100 Billion. If Paysafe is able to show growth on par with PayPal and SQ they should be trading at a much higher multiple. See the reddit link above for DD on valuation.

In summary, I think Paysafe is a low risk / high reward stock compare to other fintech. Their growth is easier to predict as we can rely on their publicly traded customers data which is showing high growth going forward. They got the 2nd largest digital wallet. They are involved in the highly popular and fast growth digital currency market. I believe as a monopoly in iGaming/Sport Betting their growth will be massive when the 4 largest states: CA, TX, NY, FL begin to allow online sport betting. This is something about Paysafe that I like so much because no other fintech has. This is a massive high growth area and they own the space. For these reason, I am extremely bullish and I like Paysafe for both short and longer term play.

2021-05-04 22:10:22,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, May 4, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 4, 2021**

Stocks fell on Tuesday following a mixed session yesterday, as the selloff in technology stocks accelerated following remarks from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Market participants wait for the next set of corporate earnings reports and economic data, particularly the April Jobs report due to be released May 7.

Stocks fell after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested she thought interest rates in the US might need to rise in the near term in order to prevent an economic overheating as recovery continues. Rising rates would weigh on the valuations of growth companies and could slow down the recent rally to fresh highs. Janet Yellen said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" This somewhat contradicts recent commentary from members of the Federal Reserve, will have to see how this story unfolds.

Earnings season continues to exceed even the most optimistic expectations, with more than 85% of the companies that have reported exceeding expectations by an average of 22.1%, according to data from FactSet. These strong earnings beat, however, many companies did not see their stocks pop up. Analysts largely chalk this up to the already elevated expectation Wall Street had coming into this earnings season. Hilary Kramer (no relation) said, “The numbers were good but Wall Street's response was neutral at best. When the best earnings growth since 2010 spawns a yawn it's pretty clear that perfection is priced in. While there's no seasonal sell signal flashing, there's no immediate reason to buy either. This is a great opportunity to review your positions, make any adjustments, and then retreat to the sidelines for the next few months.”

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

Stocks traded mixed, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) ticking higher while the tech-Nasdaq (QQQ) declined. The SPY rose 5% in April, for the best performance since November of last year. Following a rotation into cyclical and reopening stocks at the beginning of the year, April saw the communication services and consumer discretionary sectors lead gains in the SPY, returning to the leadership position. Growth stocks continued underperforming, paring recent gains after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said some sectors of the market appeared “frothy”. Looking ahead, market participants continue to monitor corporate earnings and wait for more economic data, particularly the April jobs report that will be released May 7th. 

A wave of stronger-than-expected earnings, especially in banks and mega-caps like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT), have fueled the latest rally in the market. In the US, effective distribution of the vaccine and the gradual reopening of the economy have led to a surge in consumer spending, driving corporate profits way past analyst estimates. As of Friday, 86% of S&amp;P 500 companies had beaten first-quarter earnings expectations, according to FactSet data. This would mark the highest proportion since at least 2008, if the current rate holds through the end of first-quarter earnings season.

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

Last week, President Biden addressed a joint session of Congress, during which he said “America was back on the move again” following the coronavirus pandemic.. In his address, President Biden touted his $2 trillion infrastructure plan and unveiled a new $1.8 trillion proposal aimed at supporting children, students, and families. This proposal, called the American Families Plan, would be funded in part with the newly proposed tax increases on the wealthy. [Read the details of the proposal here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/).

* Legendary investor Warren Buffet spoke at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting. There were a lot of takeaways, we encourage everyone to check it out.
* Shares of Uber, Lyft and Doordash (DASH) fell sharply after Reuters reported that Labor Secretary Marty Walsh supported reclassifying gig workers as employees. This change would give workers additional benefits at a large cost to companies. Recall the battle last year over Proposition 22 in California, which eventually passed in favor of companies in the gig-economy. 
* New York City [Mayor Bill de Blasio said ](https://twitter.com/Morning_Joe/status/1387733678093127684)that NYC would open with full capacity beginning July 1.

* Twitter (TWTR)said on Monday it will introduce a new feature to let users charge admission to their live audio chat rooms in its ""Spaces"" feature, as the social media company seeks to court more content creators. Starting on Monday, any user with at least 600 followers can be a host, the company added.

2021-04-28 22:37:27,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, April 28, 2021","The stock market fell on Wednesday, with all three major indexes closing modestly red as market participants continue to digest the corporate earnings season and new commentary from the Federal Open Markets Committee. 

The FOMC said the effective distribution of the vaccine in the US has improved economic conditions but reiterated interest rates will remain near-zero and the asset purchasing program in place. The Fed said, “Amid progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have risen.” The committee remains optimistic about the rebound in economic activity, describing the most affected sectors as “having shown improvement”, but shows no signs of slowing quantitative easing or raising interest rates. With more than 8 million people still out of jobs compared to pre-pandemic levels, FOMC reiterated its commitment to supporting the economy.

The Fed also said inflation has “risen” but attributed the higher readings to “transitory factors”, meaning they expect any rise in inflationary pressures to be short-lived. Central bank officials warn that higher inflation reading could be coming as a result of measuring year-over-year changes from a highly unusual 2020. In other words, The Fed looks at changes in prices in a year-over-year format. Data for March and April of this year could therefore reflect large price “increases” because they are being compared against March and April in 2020 that saw massive price drops. 

Economic data published since the Fed’s last meeting in March 17 have largely supported their brighter outlook. Consumer spending surged 9.8% in March and initial jobless claims dropped to pandemic-era lows as more states continue reopening measures. In other news, according to a report by the Conference Board, consumer confidence has surged to a 14-month high in April as effective distribution of the vaccine and easing of social distancing guidelines in the US allows for the economy to gradually reopen. The Conference Board's monthly consumer confidence index jumped to a reading of 121.7 in April, or well above the 113.0 expected. Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said in a statement, “Consumers’ assessment of current conditions improved significantly in April, suggesting the economic recovery strengthened further in early Q2. Consumers’ optimism about the short-term outlook held steady this month. Consumers were more upbeat about their income prospects, perhaps due to the improving job market and the recent round of stimulus checks.”

**Highlights**

* The US trade deficit rose to a new record high in March, according to data from the Department of Commerce. The deficit increased by 4% to $90.6 billion, higher than the $88 expected by economists
* Mortgage applications fell 2.5% week-on-week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. This follows a jump of 8.6% last week, which had marked the first rise in seven weeks. 
* A deep-sea mining robot on a test mission to bring up rocks rich in cobalt and nickel from the floor of the Pacific Ocean has malfunctioned and is lost.
* According to multiple reports, Nio began development on more affordable SUV to cater for the mid to low price markets and is also working on an upgraded 70-kilowatt-hour battery pack using lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, which are cheaper than the ones the company uses now
* Nio said in a tweet from its official handle that its global vision is gaining steam and the company is making plans to expand to Norway as part of its plan to expand into Europe. Press Conference on May 6th at 1 am PDT 
* The European Union fined Credit Suisse Group AG, Bank of America Corp. and Credit Agricole SA a small amount for illegally colluding on trades in government bond markets at the expense of their clients.

**Week of 4/26/21**

The S&amp;P500 opened Monday 4/26/21 at 4185.03, above the previous close of 4180.05 on Friday 4/23/21.

Chip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020’s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world’s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand.

Cisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could “...\[take\] another six months…” for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware.

The effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW’s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, “...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter…” So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.

The United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders earlier this month to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.  
Meanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC has announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang’s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap.

The increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reports earnings on Wednesday. Analysts are looking for the technology giant to post earnings of $0.98 on revenue of $77 billion after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple’s first product showcase of the year last Wednesday, and the company’s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it’s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat.

Microsoft will report earnings Tuesday. Analyst estimates place earnings around $1.78 per share over $43 billion in revenue. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft’s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector.

Executives from Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube will testify before a U.S. Senate Judiciary hearing committee on Tuesday. The executives have been called to testify on the use of algorithms to dictate what consumers watch and read on the popular platforms. The hearing comes amid concerns that manipulative practices have led to massive distribution of misinformation, with repercussions that reverberate throughout society. The practice of purposefully serving consumers misinformation has been dubbed “algorithmic amplification,” and the results of the hearings could have a significant impact on the social media industry. All three companies will report earnings this week.

OPEC will hold its opening session Wednesday. The conference will take place over the course of the day, and will include remarks from prominent Russian and Saudi chairman. The conference is meant to be informative and expected to feature little remark on policy. However speculation that additional information on a potential NOPEC bill could have an impact on U.S. trading. The conference comes one day before North American oil giants Exxon and Shell report earnings.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference at 2:30PM Wednesday. Powell’s recent statements at press conferences have highlighted an economy which although largely recovered, still faces a degree of risk in the face of the pandemic. Powell stated in an April 11th CBS interview, “The principal risk to our economy right now really is that the disease would spread again more quickly.” Powell’s comments come a day before advanced release of the Q1 U.S. GDP, which Bank of America analysts predict will show a real growth rate of 6.5%.

2021-04-15 08:32:24,r/stocks,DD on fast growing fintech - KSPI.IL (one of ARKF's stock picks),"I’d like to share thesis on [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) ([KSPI.IL](https://kspi.il/)), the largest Payments, Marketplace and Fintech Ecosystem in Kazakhstan with a leading market share in each of its key services and products. At the core of its Ecosystem is the [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) Super App, the leading mobile app in the country with 4.9 million DAU (up 155% YoY) and 9.1 million MAU (up 59% YoY), which is roughly half of the country population. The app serves as a single gateway to all of the Company’s services and is an integral part of people’s daily lives in Kazakhstan. As people’s lives become increasingly digitalized [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) expects the usage of its Super App to grow, with the COVID-19 pandemic accelerating consumer adoption of cashless payments, e-Commerce and digital financial services. [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) is built around an ecosystem business model, where the growth and development of one service contributes to the growth and development of other services, creating a powerful virtuous cycle. A growing number of services being used by the Company’s consumers results in synergies across all of its Platforms, structurally high profitability and creates a powerful self-reinforcing network effect, giving the Company strong competitive advantages.

According to the recent Full-Year 20202 Financial Results, total revenue reached KZT641,437 M (\~$1.5B), equivalent to adj. 25.5% YoY growth; and net income reached KZT274,318 M (\~$0.65B), equivalent to net income 42.8% margin and 43.2% YoY growth.

**The** [**Kaspi.kz**](https://kaspi.kz/) **Ecosystem currently comprises the following three market leading Platforms:**

• Payments Platform connects customers, which consist of both consumers and merchants, to facilitate cashless, digital payment transactions. The Company offers its customers a technology platform to both pay and receive payments for goods and services, as well as to transfer and withdraw money. Consumers can transact with merchants and amongst themselves using a variety of services, including the [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) Super App, a Kaspi Gold pre-paid debit card and/or any bank card or e-Wallet.

In 2020, [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/)’s proprietary payment network transactions accounted for 66% of total payment network transactions in Kazakhstan, while other payment networks, including Visa and Mastercard, had an aggregate share of 34% of the total payment network transactions in the country. With close ties to Kazakhstan’s government, [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) has also emerged as the country’s unofficial national online bank for paying taxes and fines, assuming a role that would otherwise be filled by the civil service or a government department, and further driving new user growth across the country.

• Marketplace Platform connects merchants and consumers, enabling merchants to increase their sales and enabling consumers to buy a broad selection of products and services from a variety of online and offline merchants. The Company helps merchants increase their sales by linking them to its technology, payment options, including buy-now-pay-later consumer finance products, fulfilment, marketing and branding services.

[Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) was the largest online retailer in Kazakhstan by sales value in 2020, with an e-Commerce gross merchandise value (“GMV”) share corresponding to 46% of the market.

• Fintech Platform enables consumers to access, primarily through [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) Super App, the Company’s digital finance products, including consumer finance and deposits. [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/)’s buy-now-pay-later consumer finance products are also strategically integrated with its Marketplace Platform, which means that consumers are able to make a purchase seamlessly with financing and then pay over time in monthly instalments.

In 2020 the Company enjoyed the largest market share of Consumer Loans in Kazakhstan, amounting to 32%.

[**Kaspi.kz**](https://kaspi.kz/)**’s Future**

• [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) Travel. In 2020, [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) acquires Santufei and launches online travel platform. Users can now purchase domestic and international flights from over 700 airlines through the app. Over time [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) plans to expand into ground transportation, hotels and package holidays.

• Speed and Risk Management. Credit decisions made in only 10 secs, and time to money 15 mins based on machine learning driven real-time decision making based on historic online data collected by [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) and data purchased from third parties. The second type focuses on the client’s activity immediately preceding the application with the aim of assessing intent to buy. What client did on their phone one minute ago tells you a lot. These checks significantly reduced the risk of fraud. ATM network has face-recognition technology to detect fraudulent activity on the spot. Customers who entered their national identity number or displayed the QR code to the ATM could make any transaction without a plastic card.

• Growth via the Merchant Segment. The merchant network gave [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) another avenue for expansion. The company had daily contact with merchants, both online and offline. Around one third of all merchants’ sales were realized through its marketplace. It could easily provide services to its merchant base including payment services and capital financing tools. Capitalizing on its advanced analytical tools, the company was also able to provide merchants access to sophisticated marketing tools that they could not afford on their own.

• Geographic Expansion. Central Asia and the Caucasus was a natural expansion area for [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/). Russian was spoken throughout the region, and they shared a common culture. Mr. Lomtadze estimated that establishing a presence in any country in the region would take no more than 12 months because [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) had a natural advantage: almost everything it offered was online in its mobile app, so they were able to enter the market with a marketplace or payments platform, which required no investment in physical outlets, posed no credit risks, and was not heavily regulated like financial services. Banks, on the other hand, would normally enter a market with loans, and they needed branches. Payments were also a tool for collecting customer data that then could be used for generating a credit rating for consumer financing decisions. “Our mobile app is like Uber,” Lomtadze declared. “Uber can scale around the world because of its simple onboarding process. In today's world, you don’t really need to own a fleet of cars to provide taxi services. By the same token, you don't have to have a showroom and a warehouse full of TVs to sell televisions. You can basically organize everything through technology and sell items via your mobile app.”

o Azerbaijan was the first target. In the beginning of 2018, [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) was eyeing a potential acquisition target in the country that owned three leading online marketplaces for—new and used items, cars, and real estate. Out of its 10 million citizens, almost half live in the capital city. That’s great for fulfillment. An acquisition here would expand target market from 18 to 28 million overnight.

o For the same reasons Uzbekistan and Georgia attractive markets as well.

• In terms of existing models, Alibaba is closest to [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) in terms of the range of products it offers and its multiple contact points with customers. The company, in addition to its mobile app, captured customers in its outlets, ATMs, merchant shops, and retailers’ points of sale. [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) had also been generating net profit for over a decade. Its net profitability was 43%, over seven times more than Amazon’s and about three times greater than that of PayPal.

Baring Vostok, a private equity fund and a majority stake holder, had a long holding period; and recent IPO and subsequent lockup period would allow it to commence a formal exit. The subsequent lockup period ends on April 18th, 2021.

2021-04-13 22:05:50,r/stocks,Mostly speculation when starting out,"it seems like a big part of starting out and learning is buying stocks based on speculation, since I don’t know tons of information and formulas yet.

For example, MasterCard, it has a smaller market cap then VISA, can always bet on the American people’s spending habits, has room for growth, Is a company that does well in any economy, simple business model, great business overall, great competitive position. 

Is this speculation? I’m just starting out so when i start researching about a company it mostly consists of things like this. 

I look at great business that will be around for a long time and that will also continue to grow. Coca Cola, Microsoft, MasterCard, Rogers, Costco, etc

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I’m currently in university and like learning about investing in my spare time.",17,7,21smarty,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mqae63/mostly_speculation_when_starting_out/,mqae63
2021-03-29 14:44:07,r/stocks,(3/29) Monday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"#Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading week! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, March 29th, 2021-

*****

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-monday-march-29.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. U.S. futures drop after Friday’s records for Dow, S&amp;P 500

&gt; * U.S. stock futures dropped Monday after a late-session rally Friday sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 up over 1.4% and nearly 1.7%, respectively, as stocks benefiting from a successful Covid reopening outperformed, again. The Dow and S&amp;P 500, which both closed at record highs, saw weekly gains about equal to Friday’s advances. Dow stock Boeing rose 3% in Monday’s premarket after a huge aircraft order from Southwest Airlines. Southwest shares were up modestly.

&gt; * The Nasdaq on Friday erased an almost 1% loss and closed up 1.2%. However, the tech-heavy index still declined about 0.6% for the week, with just three days left in March. The Nasdaq was tracking for a slight monthly loss, while the Dow and S&amp;P 500 were poised to turn in solid gains for the month.

&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield was steady Monday, trading below its recent 14-month high. The rapid rise in yields this year has been troublesome for growth stocks, many of them tech names, as higher interest rates erode the value of future profits and squeeze market valuations.

*****

&gt; # 2. Credit Suisse, Nomura take hit from U.S. hedge fund fallout

&gt; * Credit Suisse warned Monday of a “highly significant” hit to its first-quarter results, after the Swiss-based bank began exiting positions with a large U.S. hedge fund that melted down on margin calls last week. Japanese firm Nomura said it’s evaluating a potential loss estimated at $2 billion. Shares of Nomura and Credit Suisse were getting slammed in Monday’s premarket.

&gt; * The hedge fund at the center of the fallout is Archegos Capital Management, which was forced to liquidate positions at the end of last week. The moves by the multibillion dollar U.S. family office, founded by former Tiger equity analyst Bill Hwang, caused a wave of selling pressure Friday in U.S. media stocks and Chinese internet ADRs.

*****

&gt; # 3. Ever Given cargo ship blocking Suez Canal is partially floated

&gt; * The giant Ever Given container ship blocking the Suez Canal was partially refloated early Monday, days after the vessel got stuck and brought a vital global trade route to a standstill. The Suez Canal Authority said the ship’s course has been corrected by 80% and further maneuvers will resume when the water level rises later in the day. It remains unclear when waterway will reopen to traffic as hundreds of ships are backed up and waiting to enter the Suez. Maritime data showed at least ten tankers and container ships changed course to avoid the logjam, including U.S. ships carrying natural gas for Cheniere and Shell/BG Group.

*****

&gt; # 4. Biden to push infrastructure before health and family care

&gt; * President Joe Biden will separate his sprawling plan to upgrade the nation’s infrastructure into two separate pieces. Biden on Wednesday will unveil the first part of his plan, focusing on items like rebuilding roads and railways. The second part of the president’s plan — including child-care and health-care reforms, aspects of what’s sometimes called social infrastructure — will be released in “in just a couple of weeks,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Sunday in an interview. Taken as a whole, the legislation is expected to cost more than $3 trillion.

*****

&gt; # 5. Fauci warns U.S. only ‘at the corner’ of Covid pandemic

&gt; * With the possibility of safer summer barbeques just a few months away, along with the promise of widespread Covid vaccine supply in the U.S. by the end of May, many Americans may be feeling as though the nation has finally turned the corner on the pandemic. However, White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci warned that America is really only “at the corner.”

&gt; * New daily U.S. cases, while sharply lower than January’s high, increased 12% in the past seven days compared to a week ago, according to a CNBC analysis of Johns Hopkins University data. Nearly half of people ages 65 and older have completed all of their necessary shots, according to CDC data. However, just 20% of the adult population is considered fully vaccinated.

2021-03-28 20:51:04,r/stocks,What stocks and sectors would you bet on with a 2 years timeframe?,"Short term the market is unpredictable, and very long term also becomes increasingly difficult to prevede what will happen, because of the cumulative effect of future new events.

So what do you think are the best bets today, considering both potential upside and risk, if you hope to see a profit or simply are willing to completely change your portfolio composition within a couple years?

I’m long on the aerospace industry, with Boeing, Lockheed, Airbus and Rolls Royce. They have been beaten up because of the pandemic but I assume they will recover nicely within the time. They can be volatile though.

Long Visa and MasterCard, as the move to cashless payments is surely a continuing trend.
I see a couple risks here. One is disruption by other companies. Consumer facing brands with a large user base, especially Apple Amazon and Google, have already stepped in the field and could eventually try to create their own payment networks. Then there is possible government disruption, with the move to digital currency, that could affect their margins.

Getting more speculative, PayPal is tempting because it had such a great run and then a pullback, but seems also a lot more risk, both comparatively overvalued and easier to replace.

Travel recovery looks also like a safe bet, Delta United Hilton Marriot are some interesting names, Airbnb even, but I’d be interested in finding good alternatives.

E-commerce, Amazon MercadoLibre and Alibaba are at the moment in widely different situations, but on the whole I suspect they will do well in a couple years.
MELI is a growth stock, which is toxic these days, but appears it may honestly grow. BABA is undervalued because China, but I’m confident Jack Ma and the government will find a middle ground as they have largely common interests.

Still the relations between China and much of the rest of the world are rapidly deteriorating, something I’m very concerned about, but the greatest worry is that the effect could spill well beyond Chinese stocks.

Shorting a bunch of EV and Green energy names is a temptation, but handling the volatility would require a huge margin and the risk high. Meh.

Admittedly a shorter timeframe, highly speculative bet, PSTH is tempting because of the fame of Ackman, and being back close to the initial offering price. SPACs are fast falling out of favor, yet this one has been widely publicized and could see a nice bump of share price if a merger is announced.

2021-03-22 21:32:43,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, March 22, 2021","Stocks rose on Monday, following a volatile week, with technology stocks leading the pack looking to reclaim lost ground. After leading the market higher in 2020, tech stocks have largely been under pressure following a sharp rise in Treasury yields. Banks, industrials, and other reopening stock underperformed, giving back some recent gains, but looking ahead, we expect the rotation out of tech stocks and into cyclical and reopening stocks to continue as the economy continues to gradually open back up.

After jumping to one-year highs last week, the 10 year Treasury yield retreated to hover slightly below 1.7% (1.68% at the time of writing). The sharp contrast between the performance of the Dow and the Nasdaq in recent weeks underscores the increasing rotation out of high-flying tech stocks that led the markets higher last year and into stocks that are poised to directly benefit from economic reopening. The energy and financials sectors have also been leading gains in the S&amp;P 500, outperforming tech and growth stocks in 2021. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. Higher yields make it more expensive to borrow capital. It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year yield remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was five years ago. 

Last week, The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package. FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. 

Steve Sosnick, chief strategist of at Interactive Brokers said of the Fed’s comments, “Chairman Powell was pretty adamant, as he had been in front of Congress as well, that he was not really inclined to do anything preemptive about inflation, but react to it if inflation becomes a problem if we’re at full employment. We’re a long way off from that, but the bond market now is getting nervous that we could see inflation becoming a problem before the Fed does anything about it. And that’s the little bit of a freak out that we had been seeing in bonds.”

2021-03-16 21:08:23,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, March 16, 2021. Please enjoy!","Stocks fell on Tuesday, after the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow (DIA) set fresh records yesterday, as market participants digested a weaker-than-expected report on retail, rising Treasury yields, and looked ahead to a Federal Reserve policy meeting later this week. 

Retail sales fell 3% in February from January, the Commerce Department said, worse than the 0.7% decline economists polled by FactSet expected. However, many analysts blamed bad weather and expect incoming stimulus checks to cause retail sales to spike.

Last week, after months of negotiations, the $1.9 trillion stimulus package was signed into law by President Biden this week. The bill, called the American Rescue Plan (ARP), includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The passage of the bill came exactly one year after the World Health Organization's formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.

Washington’s aggressive spending spree during the pandemic, combined with an increased pace of vaccinations, accommodative monetary policy, and the impending reopening of the economy have pushed estimates for growth higher while also fueling inflationary fears. At the time of writing, the Treasury yield sits at 1.606%. 

In light of rising Treasury yields, market participants are looking ahead to the Federal Reserve’s meeting on Wednesday, where the Central Bank is widely expected to reiterate its commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy while the economic recovery gains momentum. 

With large amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus supporting economic activity, analysts at BlackRock are anticipating ""a much stronger post-COVID economic restart than what we would expect in a normal recovery. The rapid upward adjustment in U.S. Treasury yields and more muted movement in inflation-adjusted yields make sense in this respect, and are still consistent with our new nominal theme of higher prices and government liquidity.”

Several countries have suspended distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots, with Ireland being the latest. A WHO spokeswoman, Margaret Harris, said at a briefing that an advisory committee was investigating reports of individuals falling ill or dying after developing blood clots in the post-vaccination period, but that no causal link had been established. Germany, France, Italy and Spain became the latest countries Monday to suspend use of the vaccine. This is a sharp blow against the European Union’s vaccination effort, which were already behind schedule.

2021-03-16 04:17:31,r/stocks,Trading Foreign Stocks: OTC and Volatility,"Hey, 

So, I’ve been interested in investing in Japanese companies and already have a position in the BBJP ETF for the TSE Index. But, I wanted to be a little bit more bullish and buy shares from companies such as SoftBank and Rakuten, especially since Rakuten is expanding in the US and already just made a deal with Walmart.

The situation: Foreign stocks with no ADR, according to [this article](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/s/pros-cons-buying-foreign-stocks-132848219.html), can only be traded via OTC.

That’s fine.

The Question: Since these stocks are traded OTC and not through an exchange, is the price influenced by the action of the foreign exchange or is it being affected by the domestic sentiment? These stocks have very low volume, which makes the volatility not as extreme, but apparently the risk is higher if it gets PnD — but can that PnD volatility affect the OTC stock and visa versa?

Thanks so much :)

EDIT: BBJP ETF has its portfolio built on stocks listed on the TSE and Nagoya Stock Exchange, not the OTC alternatives offered here in America.",13,3,Merkypie,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m5zroa/trading_foreign_stocks_otc_and_volatility/,m5zroa
2021-03-14 13:56:24,r/stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 15th, 2021","Good Sunday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 15th, 2021.

# **The Fed could be a catalyst for bonds, and that could drive growth stocks in week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/the-fed-could-be-a-catalyst-for-bonds-and-that-could-drive-growth-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Bonds could be volatile in the week ahead. If yields go higher, that could make it difficult for big tech and other growth stocks to gain traction.
*****
&gt; Rising bond yields have been challenging growth stocks. Names like Apple, Tesla, and Amazon have been lagging as investors move to cyclical groups that do well in an economic recovery. Even so, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow both closed at record highs Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite was lower.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq, home to big tech, did gain 3% in the past week, but it is down 5.5% over the last month.
*****
&gt; The bond market in the coming week will likely take its cues from the Federal Reserve, which meets Tuesday and Wednesday.
*****
&gt; The central bank is expected to give a nod to much better growth. Bond pros are also watching to see whether Fed officials will tweak their interest rate outlook, which now does not include any rate hikes through 2023.
*****
&gt; # Fed ahead
&gt; “The markets have way too high expectations around what the Fed is going to do or say,” said Gregory Peters, head of multi-sector and strategy at PGIM Fixed Income. “I think the message is going to be consistent.”
*****
&gt; He said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is likely to sound dovish and is unlikely to give any time frames on when the central bank will change its bond-buying program or other policy.
*****
&gt; Bond yields, which move opposite price, have been rising on an improving outlook for the economy.
*****
&gt; That trade also showed up in the stock market, with the Dow up 4% for the week to end Friday at a record 32,778. Consumer discretionary stocks, which include retail, were among the best performers, up 5.7%, boosted by optimism that individuals will spend their $1,400 stimulus checks.
*****
&gt; Yields were higher Friday after President Joe Biden said all adults would be eligible for a vaccine by May 1. The 10-year Treasury yield touched a high of 1.642% — its highest level in more than a year.
*****
&gt; It is the key rate to watch since it affects mortgages and other consumer and business loans.
*****
&gt; “The economy is going to be unbelievably strong this year — deficit spending, reopening, vaccines,” said Peters of PGIM.
*****
&gt; “It looks like for next year, all the numbers are being revised higher,” he said. “So this thing could have some sustainable growth, so I think there’s going to be pressure on rates moving higher.”
*****
&gt; Bond yields rose sharply over the past month. The rapid pace of the move has made stocks jittery as investors adjust to higher rates. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.16% on Feb. 12.
*****
&gt; # Growth vs. cyclicals
&gt; Over the last month, energy stocks have risen nearly 20%, financial stocks are up 10.2%, and industrials are up 7%. The S&amp;P technology sector is down 5.4% over the last month, and communications services, which includes internet names was up 0.8%.
*****
&gt; Higher rates are a challenge for tech and other growth stocks because those shares are expensive and have high price-earnings ratios.
*****
&gt; “When rates are very low, valuations don’t matter to people,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Global Advisors.
*****
&gt; “If rates are low, there’s no penalty,” he said. “If rates start to go up, people become much more sensitive to valuations, and that’s what we’ve seen here.”
*****
&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com, follows short-term stock market technicals and trades many of the growth stocks. Lately, however, he’s found himself sitting in many value names and cyclicals.
*****
&gt; “The names that I’m in — Visa, GM, Ford, Macy’s, 3M. Those have been my biggest winners this week,” he said. “It’s been really hard to make money in Apple, Facebook and Tesla.”
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq has been hardest hit by the rise in interest rates. Apple was down 0.3% in the past week but down 10.6% in the past month. The S&amp;P 500 finished at a record 3,943 and was up 2.6% in the past week, but is flattish over the last month, up just 0.2%.
*****
&gt; “Rate volatility could cause another inflection point in tech,” Redler said. “Last week, tech hit its reactionary low, and this [past] week it had an oversold bounce. The question is, ‘Was that it?’”
*****
&gt; “Next Wednesday, Powell could be the determining factor,” he said. “Rates made higher highs and tech is way off last Friday’s lows so maybe the market is getting more comfortable.”
*****
&gt; Apple’s stall out is unusual for the tech bellwether. It helped power the market’s gains last year.
*****
&gt; “Watch Apple because it’s a little bit of everything. Apple is growth, tech, retail. If anything is doing well, it should be Apple,” Redler said.
*****
&gt; # Bond volatility
&gt; There is some important data in the coming week, including February’s retail sales and industrial production, both on Tuesday. There is also a $24 billion 20-year Treasury note auction on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; The biggest catalyst for the bond market remains the Fed.
*****
&gt; The bond market has been speculating about something the Fed may not discuss after its meeting Wednesday afternoon. In one of its moves to shore up the economy during the pandemic, the Fed allowed banks to hold Treasury bonds without counting them against the bank’s leverage ratio. This strategy allowed institutions to have more flexibility to use their balance sheet for activities like lending.
*****
&gt; The program expires March 31.
*****
&gt; “This is a huge issue basically because you have so much Treasury supply coming and reinstating [the rule] basically makes it highly punitive for banks to own Treasurys,” Peters of PGIM said.
*****
&gt; “The markets are kind of divided on what’s going to happen,” he said. “I think most experts believe an extension is the appropriate path. You have not heard anything from the Fed on the matter.”
*****
&gt; Peters expects the Treasury market to remain volatile.
*****
&gt; “I think you’re going to see more volatility in a high pressure growth economy with extremely large deficits and an accommodative Fed,” he said. “I think you’re going to see these whippy moves.”

&gt; # March Quarterly Options Expiration Week Historically Bullish: DJIA, S&amp;P 500 &amp; NASDAQ Up 10 of Last 13

&gt; Stock options, index options, index futures, and single-stock/ETF futures all expire at the same time four times each year, March, June, September and December. This event is often referred to as Quadruple Witching or as we prefer to call it in the Stock Trader’s Almanac (2021 page 106), Triple Witching.

&gt; March’s option expiration week performance is second only to December’s and has a bullish bias. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have recorded weekly gains in about twice the number of weeks as declines. NASDAQ’s track record since 1983 is slightly softer with 23 advances and 15 declines, but all three indices have logged gains in options expiration week in ten of the last thirteen years. However, the week after is bearish for DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. S&amp;P 500 is weakest, down eight of the last nine. Last year as covid-19 began spreading globally and economies began to shut down, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 suffered their worst weekly declines during March’s quarterly options expiration.

&gt; # Signs of Life in Europe?

The sector still sits more than 50% below its 2007 all-time highs, hampered by regulations, low to negative interest rates, and all around slow growth in the Eurozone. However, despite those headwinds, the sector has benefitted from a recent rotation to value, and has certainly been assisted by rising interest rates, a phenomenon we discussed earlier this week.

&gt; Not only is performance for European financials improving in absolute terms, as global equities continue to recover from the worst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but since early October the sector has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by more than 20 percentage points. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the pattern relative to the S&amp;P 500 appears to be on the verge of breaking out of a nearly year-long technical base, similar to where US financials stood just two months ago.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Picture-3.12.21.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; While we don’t think European financials are going back to all-time highs anytime soon, remember, the sector still needs to gain 12% from current levels just to eclipse its 2020 pre-pandemic highs, a bar that certainly now seems attainable in 2021. “We remain broadly skeptical of foreign developed equities compared to their U.S. counterparts,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, financials are the largest sector within Europe and improving performance and the continued rotation to cyclical value stocks make this a development to keep an eye on.”

&gt; For now, we recommend sticking with US financials, which we recently upgraded in our latest Global Portfolio Strategy report, and is now the second best performing sector year to date, trailing only energy.

&gt; # NASDAQ Bounces Off Support As Dow, S&amp;P 500 &amp; Russell 2K Log Record Highs, But Beware the Ides of March

&gt; We’ve been tracking the NASDAQ 100 Index ($^NDX) (represented by the ETF Invesco QQQ Trust ($QQQ) as a proxy for the market’s technical picture. It contains many of the tech stocks that have been driving the economy and market for the past year through these Covid times as well as for quite a while prior – and likely to do so for some time to come.

&gt; There has definitely been some rotation out of this sector of late as DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 logged new highs today. But we would like to see confirmation with new highs in NASDAQ and NDX.

&gt; The NAS and NDX are still lagging, but today’s stronger rally in the techs is encouraging. In this updated technical picture you can see that as the NDX logged a 10% correction from its February 12 closing high of 13807.70 to its closing low on Monday March 8 of 12299.08 it bounced off key support just above 12200 (intraday low on Friday March 5 was 12208.39). Check last week’s technical analysis post for reference to previous support levels that were broken.

&gt; This 12200-level lines up with the October high which is also the high of that W-123 swing bottom pattern we mentioned last week. Back then it was key resistance that we cleared in late-November and early December. It now forms key support and lines up with the uptrend line from the September and October lows we discussed in our Almanac Investor December eNewsletter Outlook just before Thanksgiving.

&gt; However, as the Ides of March are upon us, we must remind you that the end of March has a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously as noted in the 2021 Stock Trader’s Almanac in the March Almanac and several places on pages 30-39. The Week After Triple Witching is often prone to weakness with DJIA down 22 of last 33 and the last few days often succumb to end-of-Q1 selling pressure. If any late-March weakness materializes it should be a solid buying opportunity for top-ranked April, the last month of the Best Six Months.

&gt; # Versatile Outperformers

&gt; There's still a lot of time left in the day, but the tone of the equity market has been much different today compared to Monday. Whereas Monday saw tech stocks get creamed while cyclical areas of the market rallied, today we're seeing tech stocks rebound while cyclicals lag. To illustrate, within the entire S&amp;P 500 there are just 14 stocks that have so far managed to outperform the index by at least one percentage point both yesterday and today. The table below lists each of those stocks, and looking through them, they aren't the flashy, high-profile names that you always see discussed in the media. Who said boring is a bad thing? In terms of sector representation, there's also no clear trend as eight of the eleven sectors are represented by the list of just fourteen names!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308-Table.png))**

&gt; Below we show six-month price charts of each of the 14 names listed above from our Chart Scanner tool. Here again, no clear technical theme links the stocks together. While stocks like AES, Global Payments (GPN), McKesson (MCK), and Ross Stores (ROST) remain close to six-month highs, others like Ball (BLL), Domino's (DPZ), and Market Axess (MKTX) aren't far from six-month lows.

I started investing in a moment, which was very unusual. It was April 2020. No matter what I bought, it soared almost 100% in just a few weeks.

Now, being relatively new to investing, the last 3-4 weeks of volatility changed my newcomer mindset from „buy, keep for a few days, sell with profit“ to „choose carefully“. 

As we all found out, a lot of the overhyped companies are or were massively overvalued, as the current correction is showing us. Therefore I want to „repair“ my portfolio and concentrate only on good, healthy long-term growth stocks, which can survive the test of time.

In my process of researching, I have 6 favorites so far: SQUARE, PAYPAL, MASTERCARD, VISA, SHOPIFY, AMAZON.

What do you think about them and what would you choose?

&gt; * The Dow is set to rise 200 points Wednesday after late-day selling reversed strong gains earlier in Tuesday’s session. Coming off their best days since November, the 30-stock average Tuesday fell 0.5% and the Nasdaq dropped 1.7% as tech stocks pulled back. The S&amp;P 500 slid 0.8%, a day after its biggest one-day advance since June.

&gt; * The latest ADP report on private sector employment is set for release at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before Wall Street’s open. U.S. companies are expected to have added 225,000 new jobs in February compared to January of gains 174,000 positions. The ADP lately has not been the best predictor of the government’s monthly jobs report, which comes out Friday.

&gt; # 2. Senate to begin debate soon on $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill

&gt; * The Senate is expected to start debate as soon as Wednesday on its version of the House-passed, $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill. However, it excludes a federal minimum wage boost to $15 per hour. President Joe Biden on Tuesday urged Democrats to stand united and approve the measure, even as some party moderates sought to dial back parts of the package. Democrats, with the slimmest of margins in the Senate, are using special rules that would allow them to pass the bill without GOP support.

&gt; # 3. U.S. will have enough Covid vaccines for ‘every adult’ by end of May

&gt; * The U.S. will have a large enough supply of coronavirus vaccines to inoculate “every adult in America” by the end of May, two months earlier than previously expected, Biden said at the White House on Tuesday. The announcement came as the administration works to increase production of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s newly cleared single-shot vaccine, and rival Merck agrees to pitch in.

&gt; * The Republican governors of Texas and Mississippi both announced Tuesday that they’re lifting mask mandates in their states and allowing businesses to reopen at full capacity even as the decline in new daily Covid-19 cases slows. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky on Monday warned states against lifting public health restrictions too quickly.

&gt; # 4. America’s biggest firms push for path to citizenship for ‘Dreamers’

&gt; * America’s biggest companies are urging Congress to establish a permanent path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. In a letter Wednesday, a coalition of more than 100 companies and trade associations — including Facebook, General Motors, Marriott, Target, Visa and Uber — asked Senate leaders Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to pass the bipartisan Dream Act of 2021. The move comes as Biden and Democrats on Capitol Hill look to immigration as a major legislative priority.

&gt; # 5. Stocks to watch: Rocket Companies, Las Vegas Sands, Oscar Health

&gt; * Rocket Companies fell 6% in Wednesday’s premarket trading after more than doubling over the past three sessions. On Tuesday, the Quicken Loans and Rocket Mortgage parent surged over 71% on no apparent news. The heavily shorted stock appears to have garnered bullish interest from day traders on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum.

&gt; * Casino operator Las Vegas Sands said Wednesday it would sell its Vegas real estate and operations to private equity giant Apollo Global Management for about $6.25 billion. The properties include the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo and Convention Center. Shares of Las Vegas Sands were up almost 3% in the premarket. Apollo fell nearly 1%.

&gt; * Oscar Health is set to debut Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. The health insurance startup backed by Google-parent Alphabet priced its initial public offering Tuesday evening at $39 per share, above the already-raised expected range of $36 to $38. The IPO gives Oscar Health a market value of $7.7 billion ahead of trading.

2021-02-23 20:47:21,r/stocks,Advice on diversification of portfolio,"Hey there. So, i'm looking for some advice guys or guidelines on the direction of where to look. I'm quite new to investing, my first shares being bought in january 2020 (it was apple) and we all know what happened starting january/february . In no time, the portfolio was something like -60% :)). I knew very few things but i knew not to panic sell and just ride with it, and it turned out to be a great decision. Now, since then, i've constantly made small purchases every know and then (regardless of how the market was doing) and here is how my portfolio is divided (i started investing knowing that i don't need this money in the near future, so i wanna do mostly, if not all, just buy and hold for as long as i can, big/stable companies. I don't wanna try to time the market or day trade (not that i even know how that works lol) ). Here it is:

**23%** \- Nvidia    **22%** \- Apple     **14%** \- Google     **9.2%** \- Mastercard     **6.7%** \- Amazon     **6.6%** \- Microsoft     **6.4%** \- NextEra Energy     **4.7%** \- Tesla     **4.4%** \- Visa     **3.5%** \- Boeing

Had pretty good returns on everything so far (best ones on Nvidia and Apple) so although these days were rough, everything it's still in green so i'm pretty happy with that, BUT, i see everything now as a good opportunity to buy at ""sale prices"". But rather than buying more of the stocks i have, i feel like i wanna use this opportunity to diversify the portfolio a little bit (i feel like it's too much towards the tech; by all means correct me if it's not the case here). I kept looking at Coca Cola and Disney (i see this keep going up especially in the coming years, in the idea of everything coming back to normal) for some time now, but i don't know if i should get them or not. Now my question is: If YOU would have this portfolio, what would you buy to diversify it (i don't know, maybe more towards health-care, more consumer , etc) . ANY advice is more than welcome, as i said, i'm pretty new to this, although i think i know a thing or two.

2021-02-23 19:17:42,r/stocks,What is your opinion about SUSL? What do I need to look for in a ETF?,"I want to diversity my portfolio so I started looking into ETFs and found this ETF called ishares ESG MSCI USA leaders. The ticker is SUSL. It’s a relatively new ETF. It was started in 2020. It’s basically takes all the companies that rank highly on the ESG fund rating. 

One reason it was more attractive to me than say SPY, VOO and other etfs is that it’s relatively very cheap and the quantity I get for the same investment is higher.also with the world moving towards more stringent environmental policies I think that ESG oriented shares will grow at a faster rate. Looking it up on ishares.com the total return from inception is 20.23 percent. Which I believe is good. Some of the Holdings as of 2021 are Microsoft, google, Tesla, JNJ, Visa, nivida, Disney, PG and MasterCard with Microsoft holding 10 percent weight. Basically most of the companies in SPY. The chart is also very similar in movement with SPY. 

It’s also attractive because it seems to have similar returns compared to SPY for let’s say 10,000 dollars investment. Based on the information available on yahoo finance spy closed at 322.42 on feb 24th 2020. SUSL closed at 56.60. If $10,000 was invested in SPY on feb 24th 2020 then today the return would be 1652 dollars. The same for SUSL would be 1628 dollars. The difference is 24 dollars. Even the dividend returns is similar. For 10000 dollars you get around 27 SPY and 156 SUSL. based on Nasdaq SPY gave out $5.691 and SUSL gave out  $0.896 respectively per share in the whole of 2020. Assuming the same dividends are given out in 2021 then Spy earns 153 vs 140 for SUSL. 
The difference is 13 dollars. 

I understand SPY and SUSL are not the same because the holding percentages  are different and the volume for SUSL is considerably low. SUSL volume is consistently below 25k where as spy has a volume of around 50 million. But chart wise the movement and growth seems to be similar. 

I am not saying SUSL is a better investment than SPY. Honestly I know the above information is not enough to make a decision. I like the fact that I get more shares for SUSL while gettomv similar returns but What else do I need to look at to figure out if SUSL is good or not? Does having low volume hurt?",7,1,CptIskarJarak,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lqp24f/what_is_your_opinion_about_susl_what_do_i_need_to/,lqp24f

2021-02-13 07:00:04,r/stocks,High growth blue-chip stock for your portfolio： Paypal,"Previously, I've made my case for Fiverr, a company for freelancers, only last week. Since my recommendation, the stock has grown from 270 to 320 as time of writing. That's an \~20% increase. I believe the future of work will also be 'online' as opposed to traditional 'in office'. The last year, the coronavirus has only accelerated the shift to online-work.

I now propose another stock, PayPal. What's my reasoning for this? When you look at growth stocks, you also look at their suppliers. For Tesla, for example, you look at who's supplying the batteries for electric cars and can bet on that as well. The rise of Tesla and electric cars has created a halo effect, and the rise in their stocks for all of the industry.

Now, when you think of Fiverr, and the rise of companies based on online work, payment processing companies will benefit. When you transact with freelancers half way across the world, we are looking at payment processing companies that serve as a method of payment for your transaction. The likes of Visa, Mastercard, and Paypal stand to benefit. Why specifically PayPal?

Basically not only will PayPal stand to benefit from increased transactions as outlined above, Paypal also looking to get into anything related to digital payments. To quote, PayPal has jumped into the mobile payments space with Venmo, which is now the most widely used mobile peer-to-peer payments app out there. PayPal has also delved into cryptocurrencies, and now accepts cryptos on its payment platform. What’s more, the payments company is also jumping into more direct shopping and stock trading.

Basically, it’s doing it all. PayPal is turning into an all-in-one digital wallet for consumers. They are looking at doubling it's user-base and hence revenues. It's parallel is Alibaba's Ant Financial. It's massive in China, and before the Chinese government clamped down on the IPO, it was looking to the biggest IPO in all history.

If you are looking to place a blue-chip stock in your portfolio, I believe Paypal will the next best bet.",57,25,mlsbbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/liul4v/high_growth_bluechip_stock_for_your_portfolio/,liul4v

I apologize for not including charts, graphics, or setting up a sub-reddit but I’m not the most sophisticated user when it comes to that stuff. (If somebody would like to take the lead, feel free.) I intend to do my own independent DD but right now an initial investment looks promising given the company’s market opportunity and valuation. IMHO Payoneer could be a very nice long-term hold. (Sorry WSB. No rocket emoji - yet.)

The acquisition is expected to close within the first half of 2021.

**Payoneer Investment Thesis**

**Summary:** Payoneer is Paypal for B2B global commerce, particularly outside North American and Europe. Payoneer offers investors exposure to mobile and digital commerce, particularly cross-border transactions, at an attractive entry point. What makes the investment compelling is that Payoneer has been around for 15 years, which removes a fair amount of execution risk related to growth, i.e., the team know what they're doing. The company is also investing in providing additional services for its customer base which should contribute to growth and strengthen its competitive position.

**Company:** Payoneer, acquired by FTOC, provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises. In 2020, the company recognized $345mn of revenue (31% Y/Y growth adjusted for the pandemic) on $44bn of transactions. The company was founded 15 years ago and operates in over 190 countries (basically the whole world).

**Customers:** Enterprises and SMB. The ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network.

**Industry and market opportunity:** B2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, “scale” and “network effects”. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they’re benefitting from these dynamics. Analysts estimate the global B2B market at over a trillion $ and cross-border payments at $300mn. Obviously, the pandemic only accelerated these trends.

**Management team:** Betsy Cohen led FTOC and has extensive expensive in the FinTech space, including leading previous SPACs and founding Bancorp Bank. Scott Galit has experience at Mastercard and First Data.

**Business model:** Volume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and is expected to grow at 38% in 2021 and 2022, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth for the next two years. The key here is that these growth rates are higher than the overall market so Payoneer appears to be taking share but again more DD is needed.

While the transaction margins have been growing, the company forecasted margins to remain flat at 72% for the next two years. I believe this forecast is due to a change in the blended take rate but unfortunately the company really didn’t elaborate here. I would have expected the revenue growth to drive some incremental margin expansion but I’m clearly missing a piece of the story. This may be an issue for investors. That said, the CFO offered long-terms targets of +20% revenue growth and +20% EBITDA margins.

**Valuation:** The transaction assumes an enterprise value (EV) of $3.3 billion, which equates to 7.6x EV to 2021 revenue. This multiple is in-line with global processors but well below digital payment and ecommerce companies such as PayPal, Square, and Shopify. FTOC shareholders will own 19.2% at closing.

Note: there is a management earn-out of 30 million shares at the $15 and $17 mark. Additionally, the transaction includes a $300mn PIPE.

**Investment Thesis**

**1.** **Majority of traffic stays within the network.** In my opinion, this is the key company metric because it reflects how valuable the network is to its customers. This metric continues to increase for Payoneer.

**2.** **Exposure to digital commerce and mobility trends.** As everyone realizes, this is a big and growing market which the pandemic accelerated.

3. **Global network provides network effects and is difficult to replicate.** The benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer’s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company’s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky.

4. **Playing the long game.** The company’s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It’s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Expect M&amp;A to figure into the company’s strategic plans as well.

**5.** **Attractive valuation:** Payoneer’s valuation is in-line with global processors but well below digital payment and ecommerce companies. This company’s valuation multiple will likely change as the business becomes better known within the investment community and the company posts a few solid quarters of earnings results. I feel like this is more a when rather than if issue.

**Risks:**

1. **Competition:** Paypal is a giant and only getting stronger as 4Q results testifies. The company has leveraged network scale effects to achieve a market cap rivaling Mastercard. Skrill is also well known in this space. Mastercard and Visa certainly play in cross border transactions but I don’t think they provide the level of services Payoneer does. Definitely need to do more DD here.
2. **Regulatory:** Payoneer needs to navigate every country’s regulatory environment. The company has certainly done a good job but as the FAANGS can testify, the larger you get, the bigger target you become. Europe is trying to displace MA and V.
3. **FX exposure.** I’m sure the company has a world class FX hedging team but I feel like this needs to be flagged given the scale of the business. Investors could unintentionally have FX exposure.

**TLDR:** Payoneer is a proven company in a great space with a solid management team that is playing the long-game. IMHO, it is shaping up to be a very attractive investment for LT investors at the current valuation with the caveat that more DD is needed around competition and near-term margins.

2021-01-30 04:34:36,r/stocks,"What to make of the week &amp; 3 buying opportunities NOT named GME, AMC and BB","A volatile end to the week, with the DOW falling below 30000, and the markets selling off.  There are a few headlines to consider... some say it was hedgefunds selling to cover their losses, others say it was the J&amp;J trials posting results that fell below expectations, and others say we are at the beginning of a complete crash (maybe a correction, but a complete crash is unlikely).  Ultimately, for the investor sell-offs can be healthy and can present buying opportunities.  Full disclosure, I haven't bought a single share of GME, AMC, BB, or NOK.  I have my eyes set on other buying opportunities--opportunities that I think will continue to pay off in the long run.  These are stocks where I slightly increased my positions in today and will continue to consider buying next week depending on how the markets play out.  **Even when you see a buying opportunity, you don't all-in on one given day.  You don't know what the next day/week/month will look like.**

&amp;#x200B;

1. **WMT:**  WMT has had a \~7% dip since hitting 150.  WMT has plans to really ramp up its presence in the advertising industry, which, in my opinion, has a lot of potential.  WMT has 250M customers on a weekly basis, globally.  They are planning to release their consumer data to companies, which would be an incredible source of information for those in the ad industry. To compare, Amazon tallied about 26M transactions per week which is about 182 M per week.  WMT has made it clear that it wants to increase its revenue from ads 10+ times within the next 5 years.
2. **Apple:** INCREDIBLE earnings beat.  Can't emphasize that enough.  There is so much already publicized about Apple's amazing quarter.  Yet, the price has fallen \~8%.  It's likely that Apple has more room to grow as Apple has announced that they'd be producing their own chips.  Consumers who are looking for a computer upgrade, are likely to hold until Apple's newest technology comes out.  Tim Cook is always looking to push Apple's presence and innovation.  I'm looking to increase my position in Apple.
3. **Visa:**  Another great earnings beat followed by a sell-off.  I'm looking at this as a great buying opportunity.  This is more of a macro trend play.  Visa did well given its boost in consumers shopping online.  I can only see a company like Visa doing better as cities begin to open up once the pandemic begins to clear.  There's a pent up demand to travel, to be out, to buy into experiences that we haven't been able to do for almost a year now.  Visa's fintech plays may not have worked out, but Visa is here to stay.

#[4 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-29-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Dow futures extend losses as Wall Street’s volatile week continues

&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average was set to drop 300 points at Friday’s open, extending losses with Dow stock Johnson &amp; Johnson falling after the U.S. drug giant released data about its one-dose coronavirus vaccine. The shot was 72% effective in the U.S., but less so in other regions. Wall Street has seen a volatile week, also marked by the Reddit-fueled frenzy around GameStop and other highly shorted stocks.

&gt; The Dow Thursday recovered nearly half of Wednesday’s 633-point decline, the worst one-session drop since late October. Ahead of Friday’s trading, the Dow was nearly 2% away from its closing record high earlier this month. Three Dow stocks — Caterpillar, Honeywell and Chevron — reported quarterly earnings before-the-bell, along with drugmaker Eli Lilly.

*****

&gt; # 2. J&amp;J says vaccine less effective against some Covid variants

&gt; J&amp;J’s highly anticipated vaccine results were based on 468 confirmed Covid-19 cases among the phase three trial’s more than 43,000 volunteers, including those infected with the new, highly contagious strain found in South Africa. J&amp;J also said the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease four weeks after vaccination in all adults. If the J&amp;J vaccine gets cleared by the FDA, it would be the third approved for emergency use in the U.S., behind the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine and Moderna’s, both of which are two doses.

&gt; U.S.-based biotech firm Novavax said late Thursday that its coronavirus vaccine was more than 89% effective in protecting against Covid-19. In its phase three clinical trial conducted in Britain, the two-shot vaccine appeared to be 85.6% effective against the new strain originally found in the U.K. However, a phase two study in South African, the Novavax was only 49.4% effective against the new variant found in that country. Shares of Novavax surged nearly 60% in Friday’s premarket.

*****

&gt; # 3. Robinhood raises $1 billion, taps credit lines to facilitate GameStop trading

&gt; Robinhood raised $1 billion overnight from investors to shore up its balance sheet as the brokerage app was set to ease restrictions in the trading of certain volatile stocks, according to CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin. The money raised was on top of the $500 million the broker accessed through credit lines to ensure it had the capital required to keep allowing its clients to trade stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told CNBC tapping the credit lines was a proactive measure and denied it was because of a liquidity issue. After stumbling a day earlier, GameStop and AMC Entertainment shares surged 80% and 50% in Friday’s premarket, respectively.

*****

&gt; # 4. Democrats reject GOP attempts to break up Biden relief measure

&gt; Democrats on Capitol Hill and the White House rejected a Republican pitch to split President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan into smaller chunks. Democrats appeared ready to push the measure through without GOP help. Success would give Biden a signature accomplishment in his first 100 days in office, unleashing money to expand vaccinations and reopen schools, send $1,400 direct payments to households, and other priorities, including a gradual increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. Failure would be a high-profile setback early in his presidency.

2021-01-24 11:16:24,r/stocks,Choosing a non us broker,"I know there are many recourses and answers online but I couldn’t find any non promotional informative ones.  

I’m an 18 y.o from Israel that made a relatively big hit from buying zoom in March and taking a little advantage of the oil future price drop.  I have a capital of around 3000$ and I would like to continue trading (swing trading and long term investing) in stocks and maybe even options, but I don’t know any good non-us brokers that have 0 or a low commission.  

Until now I used my own bank as the broker but the commissions are insanely high (up to 10% per full trade).

Does anyone have experience with this type of issue? I’m not looking into daytrading currently due to my small capital. I also tried td ameritrade but couldn’t open an account since i don’t have a us social security number or visa.",4,1,Taltalonix,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l3wwge/choosing_a_non_us_broker/,l3wwge
2021-01-20 00:19:12,r/stocks,You top pick stock for this month for a long term hold,"Hi:

I own a business which generates good cash flow and has some real estate income as well. I would like to invest 30k in the Stock market and would like to hold as long as I can (it's more like for my Kids ..so they can cash out and they are 2-4 years old lol ). I know the stock is not the safest bet to invest money unless you are experienced. What stock would you invest if you want to invest 30k? A friend of mine gave this pick.

Facebook

Microsoft

Apple 

Visa

AMD 

pltr

iShares Global Clean Energy ETF

NIO ( I am debating as well as Tesla ).

What's your thought? Any input would be greatly appreciated.

2021-01-17 14:13:12,r/stocks,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How is ""Hype"" calculated?**

Well, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

*****

#[Today's Top Headlines for Wenesday, January 13th, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-13-2021.html)

# 5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday

*****

&gt; # 1. Stocks set for modest drop
&gt; * U.S. stock futures fell Wednesday, a day after Wall Street resumed its 2021 upswing with modest gains. The fallout from last week’s Capitol riot and the push to impeach President Donald Trump have been keeping a lid on market moves this week. Rising rates in the bond market, with the 10-year Treasury yield over 1.1%, have also been a headwind for stocks. However, ahead of Wednesday’s trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 were less than 1% away from their records. The Nasdaq was just over 1% away from its record high.

&gt; * Target said Wednesday comparable sales rose 17.2% in November and December. While online sales remained robust during the pandemic, shoppers also visited Target’s stores and spent more money per purchase than they did last holiday season. Target’s same-day curbside pickup grew by more than 500%, while sales fulfilled by its Shipt delivery service grew more than 300% during the holidays. Target shares were relatively flat in premarket trading.

*****

&gt; # 2. House to impeach Trump
&gt; * Trump is on the verge of being impeached for a second time. The House set the unprecedented vote for Wednesday, exactly one week after supporters of the outgoing president attacked the U.S. Capitol. While no House Republicans voted for Trump’s first impeachment, this time a small but significant number, including third-ranking GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, will join Democrats.

&gt; * Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has reportedly told associates he thinks Trump committed impeachable acts, though it’s not known if the Kentucky Republican would vote to remove the president. A conviction in the Senate, even after Trump leaves office, would prevent him from becoming president again. It’s unclear if the Senate would try to hold Trump’s impeachment trial before President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration next Wednesday.

*****

&gt; # 3. Pence rules out 25th Amendment
&gt; * The House is moving ahead with its impeachment vote after Vice President Mike Pence ruled out invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump. The House on Tuesday night passed a resolution calling on Pence and the Cabinet to push Trump out of office over his role in fomenting the Capitol attack. In a letter to House Speak Nancy Pelosi, Pence wrote, “I do not believe that such a course of action is in the best interest of our Nation or consistent with our Constitution.”

&gt; * Speaking publicly Tuesday for the first time since last week’s siege, Trump did not take any responsibility for the mob violence and warned a second impeachment could be dangerous for the country. Later in the day at the border wall in Texas, Trump made a vague threat against Biden while insisting Pence and his Cabinet won’t remove him from office.

*****

&gt; # 4. YouTube suspends Trump account
&gt; * YouTube on Tuesday suspended Trump’s account, saying the president uploaded content that violated its policies, though it did not specify any videos. The so-called strike-one on the platform prevents new uploads for a minimum seven days. “Given the ongoing concerns about violence, we will also be indefinitely disabling comments on President Trump’s channel,” said YouTube, owned by Alphabet’s Google unit. YouTube’s decision to freeze Trump’s account follows the indefinite suspension of the president’s Facebook and the permanent suspension of his Twitter.

*****

&gt; # 5. Operation Warp Speed chief resigns
&gt; * Operation Warp Speed Chief Adviser Dr. Moncef Slaoui has submitted his resignation at the request of the incoming Biden Covid team, under a plan that would see him stay in the role for a month to help with the transition, according to two people familiar with the situation. Though the initial vaccine rollout has been criticized, the speed of their development, which Slaoui oversaw, exceeded expectations, with two vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna approved for emergency use in the U.S. by the FDA.

&gt; * The U.S. will soon require all airline passengers to prove they recently tested negative for Covid-19 before flying to the country, the CDC said Tuesday. The measure, which aims to curb the spread of the disease, comes as new infections hit records. The U.S. reported a record 4,327 daily Covid deaths Tuesday. Starting Jan. 26, arriving American citizens and foreign travelers will have to test negative for Covid-19 within three days of their flight to the U.S.

2020-12-24 11:19:36,r/stocks,Which Tech ETF to buy,"In the past years I did invest in standard ETF (70 % World and 30 % Emerging Markets). Now I would like to try out ETF and shares that are more focused in certain sectors and technologies. I'm interested in cloud computing, information technology as a whole and clean energy. Many ETF in these sectors had a tremendous growth in the past 12 months. Though that does not guarantee the growth will continue. Still I think that cloud computing and IT has a big potential in the long term as it will get more important. Clean energy could get more important over time as well as more and more countries starting to take the change serious. Not so sure about short to mid term developments though.

I picked following ETF to cover these sectors. Note that I am from Germany and many US based ETF with an US ISIN are not considered as it is more difficult/expensive to get them here and it makes proper taxation more difficult. 

Cloud Computing:  **First Trust Cloud Computing UCITS ETF Acc**

[https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BFD2H405#overview](https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BFD2H405#overview)

This one covers big players like Amazon, Microsoft, Google. I would like to have them in my portfolio (despite cloud computing being only one of their services) as there will be no way around them in the future probably.

Information Technology:  **Xtrackers MSCI USA Information Technology UCITS ETF 1D** [https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BGQYRS42#overview](https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BGQYRS42#overview)

US IT companies with heavy focus on Apple and Microsoft. Involves other companies I'm interested in as Visa, Paypal etc. 

Clean Energy:  **iShares Global Clean Energy UCITS ETF**  

[https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?index=S%2526P%2BGlobal%2BClean%2BEnergy&amp;groupField=index&amp;from=search&amp;isin=IE00B1XNHC34](https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?index=S%2526P%2BGlobal%2BClean%2BEnergy&amp;groupField=index&amp;from=search&amp;isin=IE00B1XNHC34)

This one had a growth of more than 100 % in the last 12 months. On the other hand it took a giant dive in 2008 and it took until now to recover from it. Might be more risky than the other 2 ETF.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think about these ETF? Especially for Cloud Computing and IT I'd like to invest in over the next few years but I'm interested in the IT sector and related businesses in general. Maybe adding  sectors in the long term like Blockchain, AI, video game industry etc. On the other hand I'm wondering if I see things to optimistic regarding their growth and importance over the next years.",4,0,Atlas756,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kjd3ir/which_tech_etf_to_buy/,kjd3ir

2020-12-20 10:14:16,r/stocks,Your most promising stocks for the next decade?,"I'm currently looking for a few new stocks to invest in, so would be interested to hear people's favourite / highest conviction stocks and why. 

Mine would be:

Tesla - the EV market will grow rapidly in the next decade and I believe Tesla will be at the forefront of this

Visa - cash will be gone within 5 years i think. Visa is the best placed to take advantage of this due to their massive reach and popularity 

Roblox - a huge platform with lots of room to grow- China, VR etc. I think their IPO will be interesting.",93,52,LCJefferson,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kgr3q8/your_most_promising_stocks_for_the_next_decade/,kgr3q8
