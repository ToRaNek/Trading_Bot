2025-11-04 22:24:03,r/BerkshireHathaway,"Berkshire is a HOLDINGS COMPANY, not an ETF or hedge fund.","There are way too many moronic posts here about “BuFfEtT nOt BuYinG aNyThInG aNd NoT mAkInG mE aNy MoNeY!”

The simple truth is that Warren Buffet or anyone else at Berkshire do not need to buy anything. The stock portfolio is only a portion of the company holdings, and many of the stocks are mature dividend payers. Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 60 businesses in their entirety. This means that the company could entirely abstain from buying ANYTHING for the next decade and would still collect billions of dollars a year in dividends and revenue, and hypothetically the stock would still continue to appreciate as the company appreciates. 

The company stock portfolio regularly only held 2-6 businesses between the 70’s and the 90’s. The companies performance has, for the vast majority of its existence, been driven by its businesses that it owns in full.

Berkshire does not need to buy fractional stakes in AI or GOOG or anything they don’t want to in order to make money. They’re doing just fine in the consumer staple, cargo, and dozens of other businesses that they own entirely. The stocks that they own appreciating has just been a plus. 

Please actually be aware of what you own, which Buffett himself preached meeting after meeting, and stop treating this stock like it’s dead in the water because it wont buy NVDA at 60X earnings. It’s making more money per year than anyone here ever just doing what it has done best for the last 60 years.",204,20,ultra__star,https://www.reddit.com/r/BerkshireHathaway/comments/1oojqsc/berkshire_is_a_holdings_company_not_an_etf_or/,1oojqsc

I initially bought Brk.b years ago because I believed that they would make good decisions in market downturns and pick up great companies at discounted prices. They have failed to do so, missing so many obvious opportunities in both 2022 and Earlier this year when the best companies in the world were down 20-30%. Even I (a moron) loaded up on Googl, MSFT, and QQQ during the drop while Brk sat on their hands.

Recently, Brk.b has done nothing but drag my portfolio down, largely because they continue to hold government bonds through great buying opportunities.

2025-11-03 01:53:36,r/BerkshireHathaway,Entry points and buybacks,"I had two epiphanies today listening to the 2010 annual meeting on Spotify. A lot of people here probably knew these already but figured I’d share.

1. Buffet’s charitable donations running 1.5% per year ($10.5 bil) plus other sales coming from aging of the original investors like Gottesman will keep a lid on the market price of the stock moving away from intrinsic value. While they are “small” compared to the size of Berkshire, it’s still the size of probably the market cap of the smallest S&amp;P 500 company every year.
2. This may be one of the big reasons he doesn’t buy back. He doesn’t want to be seen as favoring the original investors (or his charities) at the expense of the future shareholders. So he has a very high bar (low market cap to book value) where he’ll buyback. If you plan to hold this for 30+ years like a lot of us do, the lack of buybacks help us as long as they generate a positive return with the cash. The return bar doesn’t need to be so high because Berkshire investors would be paying taxes on dividends sent to all shareholders, with many of us pay 30%+ including state and federal taxes.

For those of us who are still in accumulation mode, I don’t view this as a bad thing.

We know buffet looks quality investments, usually at a fair price in UNH case a undervalued price. 
UNH is a Healthcare conglomerate, which has its Healthcare and optum segment. They have a huge scale advantage primarily through the fact they use their optums subsidiaries to offer lower healthacre costs, which means they have vertical integration. They also have a huge network of physicians and clinics so thats network effects. In summary the moat is a combination of scale economies and network effects. So thats the moat.

Sometimes I think he is better off holding that 380 billion in cash because Berkshire is not doing great lately at finding the bottom.

=======================================================

Edit to sort of reply to all the feedback and summarize my thoughts.

1. No, I am not rich as W. Buffett.

2. No, I do not think that he is bad at investments in general. Just not great as of late and lagging behind SP500 for a couple of decades does not exactly give BRK any bragging rights. 

So, I hear you on multiple comments about him being a contrarian, some profitable international diversification and a great value investor and that the Mother of all bubbles will pop so BRK will be the one last standing. And they will return to their long term 20 percent annual returns.

Maybe so. Time will tell. It is not a given. Geico can be disrupted, Apple is overvalued by his own metrics,etc. 

3. Comments that I need to ""go find ETF bozo"" are really uncalled for and I think degrading this discussion. If you upvote this that speaks volumes about you as a person . Not me.

4. About hedge funds and calling me impatient or unqualified to appreciate what BRK tries to do. Like they are the Holy Grail of investment and a mere mortal cannot judge them..

Just to compare:

For me a top player would be The Renaissance Technologies Medallion Fund which has achieved an average annualized return of approximately 66% before fees and around 39% after fees since its 1988 inception. Now that is what I would call exceptional. 

Unfortunately, they do not accept new members . Medallion Management is so so. 14 % CAGR.

I personally if it matters to anyone achieved about the same 14 percent  in last 8 years,  7 figure portfolio, making many mistakes and learning every day . On this forum as well so thanks. 

The rest of them cannot beat SP500, just like BRK could not in the last 20 years. So will stay away from hedge funds I do have access to.

5. Last but not the least .I deeply sympathize with Mr. Buffett and learned plenty to be in a good spot when the next downturn happens. Also a great last quarter earnings report showed that it does not have to be necessarily US  market or any stock market to be profitable in general so I guess the answer to my own question would be NO. He can retire when he decided to and it is a well deserved retirement after many successful years in business.

2025-11-01 17:50:15,r/BerkshireHathaway,3Q25 Berkshire Earnings - Key Takeaways,"1. **Operating Earnings:** Came in at $13.5 billion, an increase of 34% YoY. The increase was primarily driven by strong results in (1) insurance / underwriting and (2) the “other” segment — itself largely due to forex gains on non-USD senior notes versus last year ($1.5 billion YoY swing). **Excluding this currency effect, operating earnings grew by 17% YoY.**
2. **Insurance Underwriting Profit:** Increased 216% YoY to $2.4 billion. GEICO’s pretax profit dropped by 15%, but this was more than made up by BH Primary Group and BH Reinsurance Group, which swung from total losses of $999 million to total gain of 1.4 billion.
3. **Manufacturing:** Strong results overall but clear divergence within. The industrial (+6%) and building products (+1%) businesses performed well overall, led by PCC, Marmon, IMC, and Clayton. However, the consumer products businesses saw revenue declines of 6%, with underperformers being Fruit of the Loom, Jazzwares, and Duracell.
4. **Duracell**: recorded eligible income tax credits from 2023 to present in 3Q25. **Excluding this, 3Q25 consumer product pre-tax earnings would have significantly declined**
5. **California Wildfire Costs:** No additional adjustments related to the January 2025 fires, indicating that prior loss estimates are holding steady.
6. **Cash Pile:** $354 billion, up from $340 billion in 2Q25
7. **Net seller of equities** by $6.1 billion (sold $12.5B, purchased $6.4B)
8. No share buybacks during 3Q25
9. Still evaluating the potential implications of the Big Beautiful deal on BHE's business
10. Oxychem $9.7 billion acquisition expected to close 4Q25

Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods (KBW) has downgraded Berkshire Hathaway to “Underperform”, citing several headwinds including strained insurance margins, trade tariff exposure, reduced returns on large cash balances, and uncertainty around the upcoming leadership transition.  ￼

Key Points:
	•	KBW analyst Meyer Shields lowered the target price for Berkshire’s Class A shares from $740,000 to $700,000.  ￼
	•	The downgrade reflects concerns about Geico’s profitability: Shields warns that as the insurer lowers rates and ramps up marketing to recapture market share, claims costs may rise.  ￼
	•	Tariffs &amp; trade exposure are viewed as a threat to Berkshire’s rail business (BNSF), which is sensitive to cross-Pacific trade volumes.  ￼
	•	Lower interest rates are expected to erode the returns on Berkshire’s massive cash reserves (which stood at about $344.1 billion as of June).  ￼
	•	The scale-back of clean energy tax credits (under the “One Big Beautiful Bill” framework) could hurt Berkshire Hathaway Energy’s profitability.  ￼
	•	A key concern: Warren Buffett will step down as CEO in January 2026, handing over the role to Greg Abel. Shields suggests this could dampen investor confidence, given Buffett’s long-standing reputation and influence.  ￼",45,3,NeighborhoodOld8602,https://www.reddit.com/r/BerkshireHathaway/comments/1ohhqql/cut/,1ohhqql

2025-10-26 02:47:27,r/BerkshireHathaway,Berkshire safer than MSCI World?,"Hello, I would really appreciate your opinion on this topic.
So I am constructing a stock portfolio for my mother. The goal should primarily be to slowly grow the value over time while having a rather limited downside risk. My main point is that I believe the MSCI World has a higher downside risk in the next 5-10 years compared to Berkshire, primarily because of the Technology and AI exposure. I do think that there is a certain possibility that the largest components in the MSCI World (mainly the Technology companies) will decline in prices over the next years due to valuation and overly optimistic expectations. This would certainly result in a decline in the MSCI World. I am not saying that it will happen and also not saying that there is a high probability but nevertheless there is a risk.
Compared to that I believe Berkshire has a limited risk of a larger price decline over the next 5-10 years. I rather think that the risk with Berkshire is that it may not perform as well as the MSCI World in this period. But I believe it will also not decline as much in a market downturn.
So to summarize: Does it seem reasonable to (instead of putting 100% into the MSCI World) have a 50% position in Berkshire Hathaway and possibly other stable stocks when the primary goal is not to have maximum returns but to reduce risk.

Now i am about to paraphrase Munger here, but i am going to butcher it so bear with me. Basically he was saying he would much rather own a business that can generate cold hard cash, rather than show they're inventory and explain how thats where there money is. This also coincides with Henry Singleton and how he thought cash was king and looked at cash flow and ingnored the rest of the accounting worlds bs. Obviously he looked at other metrics, but i do think the cash flow statement says it all.

2025-10-16 16:24:15,r/BerkshireHathaway,Berkshire Should Issue Swiss Bonds And Buy Nestle,"We all know about Buffett's infinite-ROE investment in the Japanese conglomerates. Berkshire issued JPY bonds at abysmally low interest rates and used the money to buy Japanese conglomerates. These companies paid a dividend yield higher than the interest rates of the bonds + the dividend was highly unlikely to be cut in the coming years.

Can Berkshire replicate this idea in other currencies where interest rates are abysmally low? Consider CHF bonds issued to buy Nestle.

The Swiss government is [paying](https://tradingeconomics.com/switzerland/government-bond-yield) 0.16% rate on 10-year bonds. Investment-grade companies issuing CHF bonds are [paying](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/fixed-income/sp-switzerland-investment-grade-corporate-bond-index/#overview) 0.69% rate on 3-4 year bonds. Berkshire can probably issue bonds below this rate, considering the company's creditworthiness.

Nestle is [paying](https://www.wisesheets.io/NESN.SW/dividend-history) a dividend yield of 3.71%. This company is within the circle of competence for Berkshire. Nestle sells consumer defensive products and is highly unlikely to cut dividends. Additionally, Switzerland is a developed economy that does not have high inflation or governance risk.

If not Nestle, they can pick another large-cap company from Switzerland that they are comfortable buying. It will likely pay dividends higher than their interest costs.

2025-10-04 09:53:59,r/stocks,Is Berkshire doomed to stagnation until Buffet dies?,"So BRK.B has been trading sideways for almost a year now, famously expanding a bag of cash that could buy entire small GDP countries.

Why?

I suspect even the smartest investors of the firm realize one simple fact: Buffet is about to die, and the news will be on everyone's face, causing a knee jerk reaction along the lines of ""He was irreplacable, the firm will stop making significant gains until true new leadership emerges"".

Which is clearly not true. But humans are spooked easily and many don't know he does not even actively manage the firm anymore.

However, since BRK.B does not pay dividends, it means all your return is based on capital gains (which is optimal from the perspective of paperwork and taxes). I understand that Berkshire uses the interest/dividends of its underlying holdings for long-term growth. I understand also that Berkshire performs open-market buybacks if the price is close the ""intrinsic"" value.

Is the following a good summary of the reasons to buy (BRK.B) over (ETFs that track the S&amp;P500 index)?

*1. you're betting that capitalism is not in crisis (i.e., there is still room for more profit to be made long-term)*  
*2. you're betting that Berkshire makes better decisions than a) the collective of all of the S&amp;P500 companies; b) the fund managers that manage holdings into an ETF from those S&amp;P500 companies*  
*3. you want to minimize taxable events (i.e., you're more focused on long-term returns than short-term returns)*

Edit: My concern about BRK.B not paying dividends is that I thought dividends guarantee some sort of return even if the price of the equity changes.

Berkshire in talks to buy Occidental's OxyChem for about $10 billion, WSJ reports

(Reuters) -Berkshire Hathaway is in talks to buy Occidental Petroleum's petrochemical unit for about $10 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday citing people familiar with the matter.

The potential sale of the OxyChem unit, which supplies products used in sectors such as medical care, food security and construction, would add to a series of divestitures the U.S. oil and gas producer has pursued in recent years.


Occidental, in which Berkshire is already the largest shareholder, has grappled with a heavy debt load, a legacy of its $55 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum in 2019, when it outbid rival Chevron to secure shale oilfields in Texas.

Anadarko's nearly a quarter-million acres in the Permian Basin hold oil and gas deposits that can produce output for decades using low-cost drilling techniques.

Occidental's $12 billion acquisition of privately held U.S. shale oil producer CrownRock last year significantly increased the company's debt load, which stood at $23.34 billion at the end of June.

The OxyChem unit generated $2.42 billion in revenue in the first two quarters of 2025.

Story by Niloy Chakrabarti  • 

In Q2, billionaire investor Bill Gates executed major stock trades worth over $4 billion (£2.9 billion) in two companies.

According to the latest filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Bill Gates purchased 6.95 million shares of Berkshire Hathaway Class B (NYSE: BKR.B) shares for the quarter ended 30th June, increasing his stake in Warren Buffett's company by a whopping 40.48%. The shares would be worth $3.43 billion (£2.54 billion) based on the closing price of $494.10 (£366.1) on Tuesday. He now owns 24.1 million Berkshire Class B shares worth over $11 billion (£8.1 billion).

Gates' decision comes after offloading millions of BRK.B shares in the previous four consecutive quarters.

In Q2, Gates Foundation Trust also offloaded 2.26 million shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), as Gates trimmed his stake in the company he founded by 7.96%. The stock sale would be worth $1.15 billion (£852 million) based on Tuesday's closing price of $509.23 (£377.3). Gates still owns 26.1 million Microsoft shares worth over $13 billion (£9.6 billion).

Gates has sold over 8.7 million shares of Microsoft since Q2 2024 despite the stock price surging over 17% in the past one year. According to analysts polled by TipRanks, Microsoft has a 12-month stock price target of $625.78 (£463.6) with the highest forecast of $680 (£503.8) from Citi.

According to a late-June filing with the SEC, legendary investor Buffett converted 8,239 Class A shares of Berkshire Hathaway into 12.35 million Class B shares of the common stock, where each Class A share was convertible into 1,500 Class B shares. He then donated over 9.4 million of those converted class B shares to the Gates Foundation Trust. The filing noted that these donations are in accordance with the Oracle of Omaha's lifetime commitments.

Buffett also donated 943,384 of the converted shares to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named after his late first wife, and 660,366 shares to each of the Sherwood Foundation, the Howard G. Buffett Foundation, and the NoVo Foundation, which are run by his three children.

In 2006, Buffett had pledged to donate 85% of his Berkshire Hathaway stake to charity, most of which was supposed to go to Gates' foundation. However, he revealed in an interview with The Wall Street Journal last year that the donations to the Gates Foundation would stop after he passes away.

Although the legendary investor did not divulge many details behind the decision, he had earlier said while resigning from the Gates Foundation board that his goals are 100% in sync with those of the foundation, and that his 'physical participation is in no way needed to achieve these goals.'

The Berkshire Hathaway Class B and Microsoft stocks make up 51.8% of Gates' $47 billion (£34.8 billion) portfolio, which comprises 25 stocks. The next stock in his portfolio with the highest exposure is Waste Management (NYSE: WM), accounting for 15.4% of his portfolio. He owns 32.3 million shares of the company worth over $7.3 billion (£5.4 billion).

Waste Management is followed by Canadian National Railway (NYSE: CNI), Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT), and Deere &amp; Co (NYSE: DE), with stakes worth $5.7 billion (£4.2 billion), $2.8 billion (£2 billion), and $1.8 billion (£1.3 billion), respectively.",90,9,rvrduce,https://www.reddit.com/r/BerkshireHathaway/comments/1npyiqe/bill_gates_buys_b_shares/,1npyiqe

I think if you are interested in owning shares of Berkshire for any period of time, you should probably understand how Buffett and Munger think about the company and its shareholders.  The principles from 1983 and 1999 haven't changed much over the intervening years.

Interestingly, under current circumstances, Principle #9 is worthy of discussion.  Not sure I've heard much from Buffett about that particular test in a while.

INTRODUCTION

Augmented by the General Re merger, Berkshire's shareholder count has doubled in the past year to about 250,000. Charlie Munger, Berkshire's Vice Chairman and my partner, and I welcome each of you. As a further greeting, we have prepared a second printing of this booklet to help you understand our business, goals, philosophy and limitations.

These pages are aimed at explaining our broad principles of operation, not at giving you detail about Berkshire's many businesses. For more detail and a continuing update on our progress, you should look to our annual reports. We will be happy to send a copy of our 1997 report to any shareholder requesting it. A great deal of additional information, including our 1977-1996 annual letters, is available at our Internet site: www.berkshirehathaway.com.

OWNER-RELATED BUSINESS PRINCIPLES

At the time of the Blue Chip merger in 1983, I set down 13 owner-related business principles that I thought would help new shareholders understand our managerial approach. As is appropriate for ""principles,"" all 13 remain alive and well today, and they are stated here in italics. A few words have been changed to bring them up-to-date and to each I've added a short commentary.

1. *Although our form is corporate, our attitude is partnership. Charlie Munger and I think of our shareholders as owner-partners, and of ourselves as managing partners. (Because of the size of our shareholdings we are also, for better or worse, controlling partners.) We do not view the company itself as the ultimate owner of our business assets but instead view the company as a conduit through which our shareholders own the assets.*Charlie and I hope that you do not think of yourself as merely owning a piece of paper whose price wiggles around daily and that is a candidate for sale when some economic or political event makes you nervous. We hope you instead visualize yourself as a part owner of a business that you expect to stay with indefinitely, much as you might if you owned a farm or apartment house in partnership with members of your family. For our part, we do not view Berkshire shareholders as faceless members of an ever-shifting crowd, but rather as co-venturers who have entrusted their funds to us for what may well turn out to be the remainder of their lives.The evidence suggests that most Berkshire shareholders have indeed embraced this long-term partnership concept. The annual percentage turnover in Berkshire's shares is a small fraction of that occurring in the stocks of other major American corporations, even when the shares I own are excluded from the [calculation.In](http://calculation.In) effect, our shareholders behave in respect to their Berkshire stock much as Berkshire itself behaves in respect to companies in which it has an investment. As owners of, say, Coca-Cola or Gillette shares, we think of Berkshire as being a non-managing partner in two extraordinary businesses, in which we measure our success by the long-term progress of the companies rather than by the month-to-month movements of their stocks. In fact, we would not care in the least if several years went by in which there was no trading, or quotation of prices, in the stocks of those companies. If we have good long-term expectations, short-term price changes are meaningless for us except to the extent they offer us an opportunity to increase our ownership at an attractive price.
2. *In line with Berkshire's owner-orientation, most of our directors have a major portion of their net worth invested in the company. We eat our own cooking.*Charlie's family has 90% or more of its net worth in Berkshire shares; my wife, Susie, and I have more than 99%. In addition, many of my relatives - my sisters and cousins, for example - keep a huge portion of their net worth in Berkshire stock.Charlie and I feel totally comfortable with this eggs-in-one-basket situation because Berkshire itself owns a wide variety of truly extraordinary businesses. Indeed, we believe that Berkshire is close to being unique in the quality and diversity of the businesses in which it owns either a controlling interest or a minority interest of significance.Charlie and I cannot promise you results. But we can guarantee that your financial fortunes will move in lockstep with ours for whatever period of time you elect to be our partner. We have no interest in large salaries or options or other means of gaining an ""edge"" over you. We want to make money only when our partners do and in exactly the same proportion. Moreover, when I do something dumb, I want you to be able to derive some solace from the fact that my financial suffering is proportional to yours.
3. *Our long-term economic goal (subject to some qualifications mentioned later) is to maximize Berkshire's average annual rate of gain in intrinsic business value on a per-share basis. We do not measure the economic significance or performance of Berkshire by its size; we measure by per-share progress. We are certain that the rate of per-share progress will diminish in the future - a greatly enlarged capital base will see to that. But we will be disappointed if our rate does not exceed that of the average large American corporation.*Since that was written at yearend 1983, our intrinsic value (a topic I'll discuss a bit later) has increased at an annual rate of more than 25%, a pace that has definitely surprised both Charlie and me. Nevertheless the principle just stated remains valid: Operating with large amounts of capital as we do today, we cannot come close to performing as well as we once did with much smaller sums. The best rate of gain in intrinsic value we can even hope for is an average of 15% per annum, and we may well fall far short of that target. Indeed, we think very few large businesses have a chance of compounding intrinsic value at 15% per annum over an extended period of time. So it may be that we will end up meeting our stated goal - being above average - with gains that fall significantly short of 15%.
4. *Our preference would be to reach our goal by directly owning a diversified group of businesses that generate cash and consistently earn above-average returns on capital. Our second choice is to own parts of similar businesses, attained primarily through purchases of marketable common stocks by our insurance subsidiaries. The price and availability of businesses and the need for insurance capital determine any given year's capital allocation.*As has usually been the case, it is easier today to buy small pieces of outstanding businesses via the stock market than to buy similar businesses in their entirety on a negotiated basis. Nevertheless, we continue to prefer the 100% purchase, and in some years we get lucky: In the last three years, in fact, we made seven acquisitions. Though there will be dry years also, we expect to make a number of acquisitions in the decades to come, and our hope is that they will be large. If these purchases approach the quality of those we have made in the past, Berkshire will be well served.The challenge for us is to generate ideas as rapidly as we generate cash. In this respect, a depressed stock market is likely to present us with significant advantages. For one thing, it tends to reduce the prices at which entire companies become available for purchase. Second, a depressed market makes it easier for our insurance companies to buy small pieces of wonderful businesses - including additional pieces of businesses we already own - at attractive prices. And third, some of those same wonderful businesses, such as Coca-Cola, are consistent buyers of their own shares, which means that they, and we, gain from the cheaper prices at which they can buy.Overall, Berkshire and its long-term shareholders benefit from a sinking stock market much as a regular purchaser of food benefits from declining food prices. So when the market plummets - as it will from time to time - neither panic nor mourn. It's good news for Berkshire.
5. *Because of our two-pronged approach to business ownership and because of the limitations of conventional accounting, consolidated reported earnings may reveal relatively little about our true economic performance. Charlie and I, both as owners and managers, virtually ignore such consolidated numbers. However, we will also report to you the earnings of each major business we control, numbers we consider of great importance. These figures, along with other information we will supply about the individual businesses, should generally aid you in making judgments about them.*To state things simply, we try to give you in the annual report the numbers and other information that really matter. Charlie and I pay a great deal of attention to how well our businesses are doing, and we also work to understand the environment in which each business is operating. For example, is one of our businesses enjoying an industry tailwind or is it facing a headwind? Charlie and I need to know exactly which situation prevails and to adjust our expectations accordingly. We will also pass along our conclusions to you.Over time, practically all of our businesses have exceeded our expectations. But occasionally we have disappointments, and we will try to be as candid in informing you about those as we are in describing the happier experiences. When we use unconventional measures to chart our progress - for instance, you will be reading in our annual reports about insurance ""float"" - we will try to explain these concepts and why we regard them as important. In other words, we believe in telling you how we think so that you can evaluate not only Berkshire's businesses but also assess our approach to management and capital allocation.
6. *Accounting consequences do not influence our operating or capital-allocation decisions. When acquisition costs are similar, we much prefer to purchase $2 of earnings that is not reportable by us under standard accounting principles than to purchase $1 of earnings that is reportable. This is precisely the choice that often faces us since entire businesses (whose earnings will be fully reportable) frequently sell for double the pro-rata price of small portions (whose earnings will be largely unreportable). In aggregate and over time, we expect the unreported earnings to be fully reflected in our intrinsic business value through capital gains.*We attempt to offset the shortcomings of conventional accounting by regularly reporting ""look-through"" earnings (though, for special and nonrecurring reasons, we occasionally omit them). The look-through numbers include Berkshire's own reported operating earnings, excluding capital gains and purchase-accounting adjustments (an explanation of which occurs later in this message) plus Berkshire's share of the undistributed earnings of our major investees - amounts that are not included in Berkshire's figures under conventional accounting. From these undistributed earnings of our investees we subtract the tax we would have owed had the earnings been paid to us as dividends. We also exclude capital gains, purchase-accounting adjustments and extraordinary charges or credits from the investee numbers.We have found over time that the undistributed earnings of our investees, in aggregate, have been fully as beneficial to Berkshire as if they had been distributed to us (and therefore had been included in the earnings we officially report). This pleasant result has occurred because most of our investees are engaged in truly outstanding businesses that can often employ incremental capital to great advantage, either by putting it to work in their businesses or by repurchasing their shares. Obviously, every capital decision that our investees have made has not benefitted us as shareholders, but overall we have garnered far more than a dollar of value for each dollar they have retained. We consequently regard look-through earnings as realistically portraying our yearly gain from [operations.In](http://operations.In) 1992, our look-through earnings were $604 million, and in that same year we set a goal of raising them by an average of 15% per annum to $1.8 billion in the year 2000. Since that time, however, we have issued additional shares - including a significant number in the 1998 merger with General Re - so that we now need look-through earnings of $2.4 billion in 2000 to match the per-share goal we originally were shooting for. This is a target we still hope to hit.
7. *We use debt sparingly and, when we do borrow, we attempt to structure our loans on a long-term fixed-rate basis. We will reject interesting opportunities rather than over-leverage our balance sheet. This conservatism has penalized our results but it is the only behavior that leaves us comfortable, considering our fiduciary obligations to policyholders, lenders and the many equity holders who have committed unusually large portions of their net worth to our care. (As one of the Indianapolis ""500"" winners said: ""To finish first, you must first finish."")*The financial calculus that Charlie and I employ would never permit our trading a good night's sleep for a shot at a few extra percentage points of return. I've never believed in risking what my family and friends have and need in order to pursue what they don't have and don't need.Besides, Berkshire has access to two low-cost, non-perilous sources of leverage that allow us to safely own far more assets than our equity capital alone would permit: deferred taxes and ""float,"" the funds of others that our insurance business holds because it receives premiums before needing to pay out losses. Both of these funding sources have grown rapidly and now total about $32 billion.Better yet, this funding to date has been cost-free. Deferred tax liabilities bear no interest. And as long as we can break even in our insurance underwriting - which we have done, on the average, during our 32 years in the business - the cost of the float developed from that operation is zero. Neither item, of course, is equity; these are real liabilities. But they are liabilities without covenants or due dates attached to them. In effect, they give us the benefit of debt - an ability to have more assets working for us - but saddle us with none of its drawbacks.Of course, there is no guarantee that we can obtain our float in the future at no cost. But we feel our chances of attaining that goal are as good as those of anyone in the insurance business. Not only have we reached the goal in the past (despite a number of important mistakes by your Chairman), our 1996 acquisition of GEICO materially improved our prospects for getting there in the future.
8. *A managerial ""wish list"" will not be filled at shareholder expense. We will not diversify by purchasing entire businesses at control prices that ignore long-term economic consequences to our shareholders. We will only do with your money what we would do with our own, weighing fully the values you can obtain by diversifying your own portfolios through direct purchases in the stock market.*Charlie and I are interested only in acquisitions that we believe will raise the per-share intrinsic value of Berkshire's stock. The size of our paychecks or our offices will never be related to the size of Berkshire's balance sheet.
9. *We feel noble intentions should be checked periodically against results. We test the wisdom of retaining earnings by assessing whether retention, over time, delivers shareholders at least $1 of market value for each $1 retained. To date, this test has been met. We will continue to apply it on a five-year rolling basis. As our net worth grows, it is more difficult to use retained earnings wisely.*We continue to pass the test, but the challenges of doing so have grown more difficult. If we reach the point that we can't create extra value by retaining earnings, we will pay them out and let our shareholders deploy the funds.
10. *We will issue common stock only when we receive as much in business value as we give. This rule applies to all forms of issuance - not only mergers or public stock offerings, but stock- for-debt swaps, stock options, and convertible securities as well. We will not sell small portions of your company - and that is what the issuance of shares amounts to - on a basis inconsistent with the value of the entire enterprise.*When we sold the Class B shares in 1996, we stated that Berkshire stock was not undervalued - and some people found that shocking. That reaction was not well-founded. Shock should have registered instead had we issued shares when our stock was undervalued. Managements that say or imply during a public offering that their stock is undervalued are usually being economical with the truth or uneconomical with their existing shareholders' money: Owners unfairly lose if their managers deliberately sell assets for 80› that in fact are worth $1. We didn't commit that kind of crime in our offering of Class B shares and we never will. (We did *not*, however, say at the time of the sale that our stock was overvalued, though many media have reported that we did.)
11. *You should be fully aware of one attitude Charlie and I share that hurts our financial performance: Regardless of price, we have no interest at all in selling any good businesses that Berkshire owns. We are also very reluctant to sell sub-par businesses as long as we expect them to generate at least some cash and as long as we feel good about their managers and labor relations. We hope not to repeat the capital-allocation mistakes that led us into such sub- par businesses. And we react with great caution to suggestions that our poor businesses can be restored to satisfactory profitability by major capital expenditures. (The projections will be dazzling and the advocates sincere, but, in the end, major additional investment in a terrible industry usually is about as rewarding as struggling in quicksand.) Nevertheless, gin rummy managerial behavior (discard your least promising business at each turn) is not our style. We would rather have our overall results penalized a bit than engage in that kind of behavior.*We continue to avoid gin rummy behavior. True, we closed our textile business in the mid-1980's after 20 years of struggling with it, but only because we felt it was doomed to run never-ending operating losses. We have not, however, given thought to selling operations that would command very fancy prices nor have we dumped our laggards, though we focus hard on curing the problems that cause them to lag.
12. *We will be candid in our reporting to you, emphasizing the pluses and minuses important in appraising business value. Our guideline is to tell you the business facts that we would want to know if our positions were reversed. We owe you no less. Moreover, as a company with a major communications business, it would be inexcusable for us to apply lesser standards of accuracy, balance and incisiveness when reporting on ourselves than we would expect our news people to apply when reporting on others. We also believe candor benefits us as managers: The CEO who misleads others in public may eventually mislead himself in private.*At Berkshire you will find no ""big bath"" accounting maneuvers or restructurings nor any ""smoothing"" of quarterly or annual results. We will always tell you how many strokes we have taken on each hole and never play around with the scorecard. When the numbers are a very rough ""guesstimate,"" as they necessarily must be in insurance reserving, we will try to be both consistent and conservative in our approach.We will be communicating with you in several ways. Through the annual report, I try to give all shareholders as much value- defining information as can be conveyed in a document kept to reasonable length. We also try to convey a liberal quantity of condensed but important information in our quarterly reports, though I don't write those (one recital a year is enough). Still another important occasion for communication is our Annual Meeting, at which Charlie and I are delighted to spend five hours or more answering questions about Berkshire. But there is one way we can't communicate: on a one-on-one basis. That isn't feasible given Berkshire's many thousands of [owners.In](http://owners.In) all of our communications, we try to make sure that no single shareholder gets an edge: We do not follow the usual practice of giving earnings ""guidance"" or other information of value to analysts or large shareholders. Our goal is to have all of our owners updated at the same time.
13. *Despite our policy of candor, we will discuss our activities in marketable securities only to the extent legally required. Good investment ideas are rare, valuable and subject to competitive appropriation just as good product or business acquisition ideas are. Therefore we normally will not talk about our investment ideas. This ban extends even to securities we have sold (because we may purchase them again) and to stocks we are incorrectly rumored to be buying. If we deny those reports but say ""no comment"" on other occasions, the no-comments become confirmation.*Though we continue to be unwilling to talk about specific stocks, we freely discuss our business and investment philosophy. I benefitted enormously from the intellectual generosity of Ben Graham, the greatest teacher in the history of finance, and I believe it appropriate to pass along what I learned from him, even if that creates new and able investment competitors for Berkshire just as Ben's teachings did for him.

AN ADDED PRINCIPLE

To the extent possible, we would like each Berkshire shareholder to record a gain or loss in market value during his period of ownership that is proportional to the gain or loss in per-share intrinsic value recorded by the company during that holding period. For this to come about, the relationship between the intrinsic value and the market price of a Berkshire share would need to remain constant, and by our preferences at 1-to-1. As that implies, we would rather see Berkshire's stock price at a fair level than a high level. Obviously, Charlie and I can't control Berkshire's price. But by our policies and communications, we can encourage informed, rational behavior by owners that, in turn, will tend to produce a stock price that is also rational. Our it's-as-bad-to-be- overvalued-as-to-be-undervalued approach may disappoint some shareholders. We believe, however, that it affords Berkshire the best prospect of attracting long-term investors who seek to profit from the progress of the company rather than from the investment mistakes of their partners.

INTRINSIC VALUE

Now let's focus on two terms that I mentioned earlier and that you will encounter in future annual reports.

Let's start with intrinsic value, an all-important concept that offers the only logical approach to evaluating the relative attractiveness of investments and businesses. Intrinsic value can be defined simply: It is the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life.

The calculation of intrinsic value, though, is not so simple. As our definition suggests, intrinsic value is an estimate rather than a precise figure, and it is additionally an estimate that must be changed if interest rates move or forecasts of future cash flows are revised. Two people looking at the same set of facts, moreover - and this would apply even to Charlie and me - will almost inevitably come up with at least slightly different intrinsic value figures. That is one reason we never give you our estimates of intrinsic value. What our annual reports do supply, though, are the facts that we ourselves use to calculate this value.

Meanwhile, we regularly report our per-share book value, an easily calculable number, though one of limited use. The limitations do not arise from our holdings of marketable securities, which are carried on our books at their current prices. Rather the inadequacies of book value have to do with the companies we control, whose values as stated on our books may be far different from their intrinsic values.

The disparity can go in either direction. For example, in 1964 we could state with certitude that Berkshire's per-share book value was $19.46. However, that figure considerably overstated the company's intrinsic value, since all of the company's resources were tied up in a sub-profitable textile business. Our textile assets had neither going- concern nor liquidation values equal to their carrying values. Today, however, Berkshire's situation is reversed: Now, our book value *far* understates Berkshire's intrinsic value, a point true because many of the businesses we control are worth much more than their carrying value.

Inadequate though they are in telling the story, we give you Berkshire's book-value figures because they today serve as a rough, albeit significantly understated, tracking measure for Berkshire's intrinsic value. In other words, the percentage change in book value in any given year is likely to be reasonably close to that year's change in intrinsic value.

You can gain some insight into the differences between book value and intrinsic value by looking at one form of investment, a college education. Think of the education's cost as its ""book value."" If this cost is to be accurate, it should include the earnings that were foregone by the student because he chose college rather than a job.

For this exercise, we will ignore the important non-economic benefits of an education and focus strictly on its economic value. First, we must estimate the earnings that the graduate will receive over his lifetime and subtract from that figure an estimate of what he would have earned had he lacked his education. That gives us an excess earnings figure, which must then be discounted, at an appropriate interest rate, back to graduation day. The dollar result equals the intrinsic economic value of the education.

Some graduates will find that the book value of their education exceeds its intrinsic value, which means that whoever paid for the education didn't get his money's worth. In other cases, the intrinsic value of an education will far exceed its book value, a result that proves capital was wisely deployed. In all cases, what is clear is that book value is meaningless as an indicator of intrinsic value.

PURCHASE-ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS

Next: spinach time. I know that a discussion of accounting technicalities turns off many readers, so let me assure you that a full and happy life can still be yours if you decide to skip this section.

Our 1996 acquisition of GEICO, however, means that purchase-accounting adjustments of about $40 million are charged against our annual earnings as recorded under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Our General Re acquisition will produce an annual charge many times this number, but we don't have final figures at this time. The magnitude of these changes makes them a subject of importance to Berkshire. In our annual reports, therefore, we will sometimes talk of earnings that we will describe as ""before purchase-accounting adjustments."" The discussion that follows will tell you why we think earnings of that description have far more economic meaning than the earnings produced by GAAP.

When Berkshire buys a business for a premium over the GAAP net worth of the acquiree - as will usually be the case, since most companies we'd want to buy don't come at a discount - that premium has to be entered on the asset side of our balance sheet. There are loads of rules about just how a company should record the premium. But to simplify this discussion, we will focus on ""Goodwill,"" the asset item to which almost all of Berkshire's acquisition premiums have been allocated. For example, when we acquired in 1996 the half of GEICO we didn't previously own, we recorded goodwill of about $1.6 billion.

GAAP requires goodwill to be amortized - that is, written off - over a period no longer than 40 years. Therefore, to extinguish our $1.6 billion in GEICO goodwill, we will take annual charges of about $40 million until 2036. This amount is not deductible for tax purposes, so it reduces both our pre-tax and after-tax earnings by $40 million.

In an accounting sense, consequently, our GEICO goodwill will disappear gradually in even-sized bites. But the one thing I can guarantee you is that the economic goodwill we have purchased at GEICO will not decline in the same measured way. In fact, my best guess is that the economic goodwill assignable to GEICO has dramatically increased since our purchase and will likely continue to increase - quite probably in a very substantial way.

I made a similar statement in our 1983 Annual Report about the goodwill attributed to See's Candy, when I used that company as an example in a discussion of goodwill accounting. At that time, our balance sheet carried about $36 million of See's goodwill. We have since been charging about $1 million against earnings every year in order to amortize the asset, and the See's goodwill on our balance sheet is now down to about $21 million. In other words, from an accounting standpoint, See's is now presented as having lost a good deal of goodwill since 1983.

The economic facts could not be more different. In 1983, See's earned about $27 million pre-tax on $11 million of net operating assets; in 1997 it earned $59 million on $5 million of net operating assets. Clearly See's economic goodwill has increased dramatically during the interval rather than decreased. Just as clearly, See's is worth many hundreds of millions of dollars more than its stated value on our books.

We could, of course, be wrong, but we expect that GEICO's gradual loss of accounting value will contunue to be paired with major increases in its economic value. Certainly that has been the pattern at most of our subsidiaries, not just See's. That is why we regularly present our operating earnings in a way that allows you to ignore all purchase-accounting adjustments.

Before leaving this subject, we should issue an important warning: Investors are often led astray by CEOs and Wall Street analysts who equate depreciation charges with the amortization charges we have just discussed. In no way are the two the same: With rare exceptions, depreciation is an economic cost every bit as real as wages, materials, or taxes. Certainly that is true at Berkshire and at virtually all the other businesses we have studied. Furthermore, we do not think so-called EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is a meaningful measure of performance. Managements that dismiss the importance of depreciation - and emphasize ""cash flow"" or EBITDA - are apt to make faulty decisions, and you should keep that in mind as you make your own investment decisions.

THE MANAGING OF BERKSHIRE

I think it's appropriate that I conclude with a discussion of Berkshire's management, today and in the future. As our first owner- related principle tells you, Charlie and I are the managing partners of Berkshire. But we subcontract all of the heavy lifting in this business to the managers of our subsidiaries. In fact, we delegate almost to the point of abdication: Though Berkshire has about 45,000 employees, only 12 of these are at headquarters.

Charlie and I mainly attend to capital allocation and the care and feeding of our key managers. Most of these managers are happiest when they are left alone to run their businesses, and that is customarily just how we leave them. That puts them in charge of all operating decisions and of dispatching the excess cash they generate to headquarters. By sending it to us, they don't get diverted by the various enticements that would come their way were they responsible for deploying the cash their businesses throw off. Furthermore, Charlie and I are exposed to a much wider range of possibilities for investing these funds than any of our managers could find in his or her own industry.

Most of our managers are independently wealthy, and it's therefore up to us to create a climate that encourages them to choose working with Berkshire over golfing or fishing. This leaves us needing to treat them fairly and in the manner that we would wish to be treated if our positions were reversed.

As for the allocation of capital, that's an activity both Charlie and I enjoy and in which we have acquired some useful experience. In a general sense, grey hair doesn't hurt on this playing field: You don't need good hand-eye coordination or well-toned muscles to push money around (thank heavens). As long as our minds continue to function effectively, Charlie and I can keep on doing our jobs pretty much as we have in the past.

On my death, Berkshire's ownership picture will change but not in a disruptive way: First, only about 1% of my stock will have to be sold to take care of bequests and taxes; second, the balance of my stock will go to my wife, Susan, if she survives me, or to a family foundation if she doesn't. In either event, Berkshire will possess a controlling shareholder guided by the same philosophy and objectives that now set our course.

At that juncture, the Buffett family will not be involved in managing the business, only in picking and overseeing the managers who do. Just who those managers will be, of course, depends on the date of my death. But I can anticipate what the management structure will be: Essentially my job will be split into two parts, with one executive becoming responsible for investments and another for operations. If the acquisition of new businesses is in prospect, the two will cooperate in making the decisions needed. Both executives will report to a board of directors who will be responsive to the controlling shareholder, whose interests will in turn be aligned with yours.

Were we to need the management structure I have just described on an immediate basis, my family and a few key individuals know who I would pick to fill both posts. Both currently work for Berkshire and are people in whom I have total confidence.

I will continue to keep my family posted on the succession issue. Since Berkshire stock will make up virtually my entire estate and will account for a similar portion of the assets of either my wife or the foundation for a considerable period after my death, you can be sure that I have thought through the succession question carefully. You can be equally sure that the principles we have employed to date in running Berkshire will continue to guide the managers who succeed me.

Lest we end on a morbid note, I also want to assure you that I have never felt better. I love running Berkshire, and if enjoying life promotes longevity, Methuselah's record is in jeopardy.

Currently B shares are actually off around $50 from their highs.  While Warren would have every holder be a 'buy and hold forever' partner, that really hasn't made much money lately.  Mostly the reason is lack of communication involving both the horde of cash, lack of any buybacks at all,  and also the management silence.  We really have no idea what they plan to do with the $350B in cash, and no one is saying.  Meanwhile Warren has gone to radio silence and isn't giving interviews.  Buffett once said it wouldn't make any sense to hold $150B in cash and here we are double that.  Able isn't able to speak as the CEO yet because he isn't.  

  
So, really the only money to be made in this stock has been by trading it.   It is what it is.

I will start by saying BRKB has been somewhat negatively affected by the whole Kraft Heinz merger and the market sentiment around Buffet setting down for what feels like a century. And obviously, Iong-term have a lot of belief in Greg Abel. If Buffet thinks he can run Berkshire, than he definitely can and do so well. So yeah, I just wanted to start there, I guess to point out a decent price to buy in at, perhaps?

Now to the topic of the post: I was really thinking about capital allocation and how that relates to META. I am making an in-depth post on my Substack; let me know if you would like to see that. Capital allocation is obviously a CEO's top priority, and it can happen in many ways, from investing back in the business to acquisitions to share buybacks. Buffet has done an unbelivable job along with munger of course, and i really do think ceo's of major companies really do need to adopt there principles on this, because i just see a lot of poor capital allocation these days, like Zuck's investment in ""VR"" all those years ago, seems longer than it is, and today his craze of ""AI"" and the crazy stupid hiring spree.

2025-08-31 23:53:59,r/BerkshireHathaway,The Deals of Warren Buffett Volume Four (just released),"First off, let me say that I liked this book and the previous editions of the series. But I was a little disappointed for the following reasons:

(1) Charts and Graphs - I didn’t count but I would estimate that charts and graphs are 10% - 20% of this book. Sometimes a chart is presented and the rest of the page is left blank. I feel like the charts were used more to fill space than for the benefit of the reader.

(2) Too much history, Too little analysis - most people that pick up this book are looking to improve their investing skills, not learn the genealogies of the people that ran businesses that were ultimately acquired by Berkshire. For some of the deals reviewed there is little for the author to talk about because there is little public information available. There’s no point reviewing a deal if at the end of the discussion you can’t say whether the deal was a good one or not.

(3) Choice of Deals to Review - BHE and Moodys chapters were strong, but some of these businesses were poor choices to cover, especially since there is little information on them that is publicly available. Did we really need two chapters on furniture companies? Especially when RC Willey and Nebraska Furniture mart were already covered in the other books. The same goes for Ben Bridge and Helzberg Diamonds. These are almost cookie cutter deals.

What’s glaringly missing from this edition is any talk on BNSF (And the publisher had the nerve to put a rail car on the cover). What a missed opportunity.

Warren Buffett celebrates his 95th birthday on Saturday—marking a milestone of longevity and leadership at Berkshire Hathaway.

Buffett plans to step down as Berkshire CEO at year’s end after 60 years at the helm. He leaves an extraordinary legacy as an investor and manager.


He took control of a struggling textile company in 1965 and has turned it into the world’s largest conglomerate with a market value of over $1 trillion and annual after-tax operating earnings of about $45 billion.

Here are 10 lessons, or takeaways, from his long career. Investors may not agree with some or many of them, but they are worth considering.

**Don’t pay up for stocks.** Buffett generally doesn’t pay more than 15 times forward earnings for a stock. Even when buying growth companies like Apple nearly a decade ago or Coca-Cola in the late 1980s, Buffett bought them for under 15 times earnings.

**Don’t be afraid to take profits—even if it means paying a lot in taxes.** While Buffett preaches “forever” investing, the reality is different. Berkshire has cut its formerly huge stake in Apple by 70% and reduced its interest in Bank of America by 40% over the past year or so. In recent years, Berkshire has exited sizable holdings in JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs Group, Citigroup and Paramount Global among others. The only two “forever” stocks in the Berkshire portfolio could be Coke and American Express.

(Shared with Permission from Prof David Kass)

**Summary**

* Berkshire Hathaway remains highly patient and disciplined, holding significant cash reserves to seize rare, compelling investment opportunities rather than chasing market trends.
* Greg Abel is confirmed as Warren Buffett's successor, with Buffett expressing full confidence that the company's future prospects are even brighter under Abel's leadership.
* Berkshire's insurance operations, especially GEICO, have seen operational improvements and cost savings but face ongoing challenges from technology, AI, and industry competition.
* Despite headwinds in utilities and insurance, Berkshire's decentralized model, strong balance sheet, and long-term focus position it well for continued growth and resilience.

 **Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting**



May 3, 2025



(Notes taken by Professor David Kass, Department of Finance, Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland)



Approximately 40,000 shareholders attended the annual meeting.



Warren Buffett (94) is on the stage with Greg Abel (63) and Ajit Jain (72)



Buffett mentioned that this was his 60th annual meeting. The previous week, he listened to Apple's quarterly call, which is the only quarterly call that he listens to. ""Tim Cook has made Berkshire a lot more money than I've ever made Berkshire Hathaway.""



Questions were submitted by shareholders to Becky Quick of CNBC, who alternated with the audience.



**Q1. Becky Quick: ""Warren, in a 2003 Fortune article, you argued for import certificates to limit trade deficits and said the import certificates basically amounted to a tariff, but recently you called tariffs an act of economic war... do you see import certificates as distinct from tariffs?**



Buffett: There's no question that tariffs can be an act of war. We should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We should do what we do best, and they should do what they do best. My import certificate idea went nowhere. The main thing is that trade should not be a weapon.



**Q2. Audience: Will the Bank of Japan's planned rate hike deter you from further investing in the Japanese stock market?**



Buffett: It's been six years since our Japanese investments. Five trading companies selling at ridiculously low prices. So, I spent a year acquiring them. We got fairly close to the 10% limit that we told the companies we would never exceed without their permission. We did ask them whether that limit could be relaxed, and it is in the process of being relaxed somewhat. In the next 50 years, we will not give a thought to selling these positions. Japan's record has been extraordinary. They talk primarily with Greg.



Abel: We have about $20 billion invested in these companies. I'd rather have $100 billion than $20 billion.



**Q3. Quick: Berkshire holds over $300 billion in cash, representing 27% of assets compared to the 13% average over the last 25 years. Is this a decision to de-risk in response to high market valuations? Or is it also a deliberate effort to position Berkshire's balance sheet for a smoother transition to Greg Abel, providing him with maximum flexibility and a clean slate for future capital allocation decisions?**



Buffett: I wouldn't do anything nearly so noble as to withhold investing myself just so that Greg could look good later on. We would spend $100 billion if something is offered that makes sense to us, that we understand, offers good value, and where we don't worry about losing money. We would rather have conditions develop where we would have $50 billion in cash rather than $335 billion in treasuries. We have made a lot of money by not wanting to be fully invested at all times. Things get extraordinarily attractive very occasionally. The long-term trend is up. I don't know when, but we will be bombarded with offerings that we'll be glad we have cash for.



**Q4. Audience: Why are you still buying stocks instead of more property? Is value investing facing new challenges in today's environment?**



Buffett: In real estate, it is so much harder than stocks in terms of negotiation of deals, time spent, and the involvement of multiple parties in ownership. Charlie did more real estate. He enjoyed real estate transactions. But he was playing a game that was interesting to him. There is just so much more opportunity, at least in the United States, that presents itself in the security market than in real estate. On the New York Stock Exchange, you can do billions of dollars' worth of business, totally anonymous, and you can do it in 5 minutes. In real estate, when you make a deal with a distressed lender, that's just the beginning. Then people start negotiating more things. We have seen some huge failures in real estate, such as Zeckendorf in the 1960s and Reichmann with the Canary Wharf buildings in London.



**Q5. Quick: As AI systems become more capable and harder to interpret, how do you see that affecting the insurance industry's ability to assess price and transfer risk?**



Jain: AI is going to be a real game-changer. We are not very good at being the fastest or the first mover. Our approach is more to wait and see until the opportunity crystallizes.



Buffett: I wouldn't trade everything that's developed in AI in the next 10 years for Ajit.



**Q6. Audience: A question about Berkshire's acquisition of Portillo's Hot Dogs in Chicago.**



Abel: A friend just called. Portillo's is owned by a private equity firm called Berkshire Partners (not Berkshire Hathaway).



**Q7. Quick: Is the U.S. entering a period of fundamental change?**



Buffett: America has been undergoing significant change ever since it was developed. We've gone through all kinds of things - great recessions, world wars, the development of the atomic bomb.



**Q8. Audience: How has acting fast benefited you?**



Buffett: There are times when you have to act fast. We were offered a business at a bargain price - $6 million. It had $2 million of cash, a $2 million piece of property on Market Street in Philadelphia, and it was making $2 million a year pre-tax. We bought the company. You have to be willing to hang up after 5 seconds, and you have to be willing to say yes after 5 seconds. You can't be filled with self-doubt in this business. One of the great pleasures in this business is having people trust you. That's really why I work at 94 when I've got more money than anybody could count.



**Q9. Quick: What changes has Todd Combs made at GEICO?**



Jain: Todd has done a great job in turning around the operations. When he took over, there were two major issues that GEICO was behind its competitors on. First is matching rate with risk, and the second telematics. We were at the bottom of the list in telematics about five or six years ago. Our telematics at GEICO is about as good as anyone else's today. In terms of matching rate to risk, we have caught up with our competitors. Todd also reduced the workforce by 20,000 from 50,000 down to 30,000, which translates to at least $2 billion per year in savings. GEICO's 80 combined ratio translates to the largest profit anyone is making on the underwriting side in the personal automobile business. We need to do a lot more in technology. AI is going to be a big force, and we need to be in a state of readiness.



Buffett: The auto insurance policy is by far the largest item in the property casualty business.



Jain: GEICO provides $29 billion float.



Buffett: $29 billion to work with for nothing. Nobody likes to buy insurance, but they sure like to drive. You get a few breaks in life in terms of people you meet who just change your life dramatically (Lorimar Davidson at GEICO). You just get lucky in life, and you want to take advantage of your luck.



**Q10. Audience: What specifically about Greg Abel makes him your preferred successor?**



Buffett: We've got a wonderful group of businesses. You really want to work at something you enjoy. I've had five bosses in my life, and I liked every one of them. I'd rather work for myself than anybody else. But if you find people that are wonderful to work with, that's the place to go. You want to find what you love. Don't worry about starting salaries. There are certain jobs you shouldn't take.



Abel: I couldn't be more humbled and honored to be in this role.



**Q11: Quick: As the U.S. dollar quickly loses value in relation to other foreign currencies in 2025, is Berkshire Hathaway taking steps to minimize this currency risk and its impact on quarterly and annual earnings? Berkshire currently borrows in Japanese yen to offset its currency risk and its Japanese stock investments. In the future, will you invest in foreign currency-denominated assets unhedged?**



Buffett: The Japanese situation is different because we intend to stay long with that position, and the funding situation is so cheap. We've owned lots of securities in foreign currencies. We do nothing in terms of impact on quarterly and annual earnings. The natural course of government is to make currency worthless over time. We only made one big currency play. We went long 12 other currencies (that means we're short the dollar). We held that position for a couple of years and made several billions of dollars on it.



**Q12. Audience: What advice would you give to government and business leaders of emerging markets like Mongolia to attract institutional investors?**



Buffett: We don't really want to go into any country where we think there's a significant probability of runaway inflation. The chances are we won't find anything in Mongolia that fits our size requirements.



**Q13. Quick: In recent years, large private equity firms like Blackstone, Apollo, and KKR have been trying to replicate the model that Berkshire pioneered decades ago. What impact have they had on Berkshire's insurance operations?**



Jain: Private equity firms have come into this space, and we are no longer competitive in the space. In the last 3-4 years, I don't think we've done a single deal.



Buffett: I think there are people who want to copy Berkshire's model, but there is no property casualty company that can basically replicate Berkshire.



**Q14. Audience: What are some pivotal lessons you learned early in your career?**



Buffett: Who you associate with is just enormously important. I would try to be associated with smart people where I could learn a lot from them, and I would try to look for something that I would do if I didn't need the money. If somebody's going to be helpful to you, you want to try to figure out ways to be helpful to them. Greg doesn't need the money, Ajit doesn't need the money, but they enjoy what they do. The best manager I ever knew was Tom Murphy Sr., who lived to be almost 98. You'd want to work for Tom Murphy. I think a happy person lives longer.



**Q15: Quick: Has the recent market volatility presented Berkshire with opportunities? You mentioned that Berkshire almost invested $10 billion.**



Buffett: What has happened in the last 30-45 days, 100 days, whatever this period has been, is really nothing. There have been three times since we acquired Berkshire that Berkshire has gone down 50% in a fairly short period of time. The Dow Jones Average was at 381 in September of 1929 and got down to 42. That's going from 100 to 11. This has not been a dramatic bear market of anything of the sort. When I was born on August 30, 1930, the Dow Jones was at 240, and it went to 41. You will see a period in the next 20 years that will be a ""hair-curler"" compared to anything we have seen before. That just happens periodically. The world makes big mistakes, and surprises happen in dramatic ways. The stock market is a good place if you have the proper temperament for it and a terrible place if you get frightened by markets that decline and get excited when stock markets go up. I know people have emotions, but you've got to check them at the door when you invest.



**Q16: Audience: Have you ever encountered any major setbacks in your life, and how did you overcome them?**



Buffett: Everybody gets setbacks. Some people have particularly bad luck in that respect. Some people get extraordinarily bad luck, and other people get extraordinarily good luck. I would focus on the things that have been good in your life rather than the bad things that happen, because bad things do happen. Charlie and I never really exercised that much or did anything.



**Q17. Quick: Would autonomous vehicles result in disruption risk to GEICO's auto insurance business? Would auto insurance today become product liability insurance for autonomous vehicles?**



Jain: Most insurance that is sold revolves around operator errors - how often they happen, how severe they are, and therefore, what premium to charge. To the extent these new self-driving cars are safer and involved in fewer accidents that insurance will be less required. Instead, it will be substituted by product liability.



Buffett: We expect change in all of our businesses. The world changes. Auto insurance will change.



Jain: The shift to product liability will provide protection for accidents that take place because of an error in product design. The number of accidents will drop. But the cost of repair will go up significantly because of the amount of technology in the car. How those two variables interact with each other in terms of the total cost of providing insurance is an open issue.



Buffett: When I walked into GEICO's office in 1951, the average price of a policy was $40 a year. Now it is $2,000, depending on location and other factors. During the same time, the number of people killed in auto accidents has fallen from six per hundred million miles driven to a little over one. The car has become incredibly safer, and it costs 50 times as much to buy an insurance policy. The auto insurance industry has been a huge growth industry. It is unprofitable to write homeowners insurance in Nebraska, even after the premium has doubled in the last 10 years. We try to get into high-probability things.



Abel: Warren, as we approach the break, would you like to address the operating earnings?



Buffett: Yes. We released our 10-Q this morning. Our insurance underwriting income was down dramatically for the first quarter. Prices are down this year, and risks are up this year. But we do have unusual advantages in the insurance business that can't really be replicated by our competition. We just announced within the last 24 hours that we, Zurich, and Chubb have arranged a joint operation to be the writer of really large sums that very few people can do. The railroad is earning a little more than last year, but it is not earning what it should be earning at the present time. The energy company last year was having problems, and those are absent this year.



Abel: Of our 49 businesses that we measure closely, 21 were up and 28 were down,



Buffett: We hold a lot more in cash and treasuries than I would like, but that is simply a question of when opportunities occur. If you get real opportunities every five or six years, you have to be patient. Our float continues to grow.



Jain: Clearly, we are heads and shoulders above anyone else. Our cost of float is negative 2.2%. That means we've got the float plus somebody's given us 2.2% of cash.



Buffett: It's like running a bank where people leave their money with you and you pay a minus 2.2%. We haven't made any share repurchases so far this year. There is a 1% tax for repurchasing shares. We pay more than you do. Tim Cook has done a wonderful job running Apple, but he spent about $100 billion in a year repurchasing shares, and there's a 1% charge attached to that now. That's a billion dollars a year. We will only buy our shares if we think that are almost certainly underpriced.



**AFTERNOON SESSION**



**Q18. Audience: Greg, what have you learned from Warren, and Warren, what have you learned from Greg?**



Abel: I want to be remembered as a great father and a great coach. I coach hockey and baseball and want to give back to kids at a young age. Warren is truly a great teacher. Warren focused on understanding the business and the risks around it.



Buffett: I spend more time looking at balance sheets than I do income statements. You learn more from balance sheets. Charlie was a remarkable teacher. My dad was an incredible teacher.



**Q19. Quick: What are Greg's views on capital allocation, particularly into new businesses?**



Abel: We will have a fortress of a balance sheet. We have a significant amount of cash right now, which is an enormous asset. We will deploy it well. It allows us to weather difficult times and not be dependent on anybody. With the allocation of capital comes management of risk and understanding risk. We will have opportunities to acquire whole businesses and parts of businesses.



Buffett: There are certain really major investment situations where we have capital like nobody else has in the private system. We have particular know-how in the whole generation and transmission arena.



**Q20. Audience: I'm 14 years old. What piece of knowledge should I learn so you would hire me in the future?**



Abel: Hard work takes all of us a long way in life.



Buffett: Keep a lot of curiosity and read a lot.



**Q21. Quick: What is your strategy on how to protect our company from future liabilities due to wildfires blamed on our electric utility companies out west?**



Buffett: We made some mistakes in the past when we bought PacifiCorp in 2005. We made a mistake by not carving it up into the seven states that we were buying.



Abel: The reality is the risk around wildfires. We can't eliminate the risk, but we can reduce it. We try to make sure we are not causing the fire. In 2020, in PacifiCorp, we didn't de-energize the system as the fire was approaching. We should try to ensure the fire does not spread further.



Quick: Doesn't that open you up to other risk. If you shut down your system, a hospital gets shut down, somebody dies?



Abel: You earn a very set return for taking on a very defined risk associated with an asset, and this has gone well beyond that. We don't earn the type of returns, nor can you earn a large enough return to take on these risks.



Buffett: There are some problems that can't be solved. If you're in something where you're going to lose, the big thing to do is quit.



Abel: Our largest challenge is the 2020 wildfire. The fire burnt into our service territory, and we became responsible for that fire effectively through the courts. We can't be the insurer of last resort. We just can't be responsible for everything that happens in a state.



Buffett: It is important that the United States have an intelligent energy policy.



**Q22. Audience: A shareholder asks to meet with Warren Buffett for one hour.**



Buffett: If I grant an hour to everybody of the 40,000 here, we'll have an interesting time the rest of my life. He then describes how, when he was young, he would drive around the country visiting small companies where CEOs would speak to him to recommend which stock they would recommend of their competitors and which stock they would short.



**Q23. Quick: A shareholder was happy that Berkshire acquired 100% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. It was done in two steps. The second larger transaction represented a 44% reduction in valuation in just two years. What factors contributed to this difference?**



Buffett: We don't know how much we'll lose out of PacifiCorp and decisions that are made. There are a lot of states that, so far, have been very good to operate in, and there are some now that are rat poison, as Charlie would say to operate in. It was an extrapolation of a societal trend. We're not in the mood to sell any business. But Berkshire Hathaway Energy is worth considerably less money than it was two years ago, based on societal factors. The public utility business is not as good a business as it was a couple of years ago. We'd like to see public utilities do well, but our responsibilities are to the shareholders of Berkshire.



**Q24. Audience: What is your estimate of Berkshire's earning power in the latest fiscal year?**



Buffett: Our underlying earning power was affected negatively by what happened in the utility field. Our earning power was not enlarged by any large acquisitions. If Berkshire went down 50% next week, I would regard that as a fantastic opportunity. Berkshire will increase its earning power over time as we retain money. In the investment business, everything isn't properly appraised, and the more fearful other people get, the better your opportunities get.



**Q25. Quick: With all of the big cap technology companies announcing massive capital investment endeavors around AI, have your rethought your comment in 2017 that the companies don't need any money?**



Buffett: Coca-Cola does not require a lot of capital to sell the syrup or concentrate. But the bottling business costs real money. We've got businesses that take very little capital that make really high returns on capital. Property casualty insurance is a rare business because you need capital as a guarantee fund, but you can use it to buy other low capital intensive businesses. Apple has not really needed any capital over the years, and it's repurchased shares with a dramatic reduction. People in the money management business get very rich because they get an override on other people's capital. Investment management is a very good game because other people put up the capital, and you charge them for the capital, whether they do well or not, and then you charge them a lot more if they do well. The trick in life is to get somebody else's capital and get an override on it. I did it for 12 years. The one difference that Charlie and I did is we put all our own money into it. So we really did share the losses with our own capital, but we got an override on other people's capital. Capitalism in the United States has succeeded.



**Q26. Audience: What high school class or activity helped influence you to become the greatest investor of all time?**



Buffett: The teachers you get in your life have an incredible impression on you. I've learned from certain employers. I was really lucky my dad was in the investment business. I would go down on Saturday and read the books. I read every book on investments in the Omaha public library. Having curiosity and finding sympathetic teachers is very useful. I was lucky to find something that fit me very early on. I just spent hours and hours on investing. Minds are really different. People have really different talents. People who teach, in general, love having a young student who's actually really interested in the subject, and they'll spend extra time with you. I ran into that. I had Graham and Dodd at Columbia. Dave Dodd treated me like a son. Look around at what really fascinates you. I wouldn't try to be somebody else. I've had at least 10 people that have had huge impacts on my life. A number of people really like helping younger people.



**Q27. Quick: Will the net benefit of DOGE be positive or negative for the long-term health of the United States?**



Buffett: Bureaucracies can be run better. Government is the ultimate. It really does not have any checks on it. They can print currency. We have a fiscal deficit that is unsustainable over a very long period of time. The U.S has a revenue/expenditure gap of 7% when probably a 3% gap is sustainable. Congress does not seem good at lowering this gap.



**Q28. Audience: Imagine it's 1776 and you are sitting alongside Benjamin Franklin. What core economic principles would you advocate?**



Buffett: I would tell him to try to design a system that doesn't invent too many things that can destroy the planet. There was no alternative to us developing the atom bomb, but the expansion of the number of people that have the ability from one to eight, and nine probably pretty soon with Iran - that's a mistake that society just could not afford to make. Solving the problem with nine variables instead of simply one. The United States is the best place, and this is the best time to be alive. The question is, how do you keep it, and how do you improve it? Fundamental to all of it is having a currency that does not get debased.



**Q29. Quick: Greg, Mr. Buffett has a hands-off approach to managing the operating subsidiaries. How would you describe you're approach?**



Abel: My style would be to have questions and comments around their business, their frameworks. They run them autonomously, and that remains in place. We want to make sure the right folks are talking and figuring out how we can benefit from the prior experiences.



Buffett: It's working way better with Greg than with me because I just didn't want to work as hard. Greg can do better at many things. Many people want to be managed, need help in being managed. Some don't. Some you just leave alone. We've had managers it would have been crazy to start giving instructions to because they just quit. And I wouldn't blame them. People want a manager that they admire.



**Q30. Audience: Berkshire Hathaway is the second largest utility provider in the United States, and its coal fleet is the dirtiest in the nation. There is no concrete plan to retire coal and fully transition to renewable energy. What about the consequences of climate change caused by companies like Berkshire?**



Abel: In the early 2000s, we made the decision to build the largest wind project in the US in Iowa. We deployed $16 billion in Iowa associated with renewable energy, consistent with what our state wanted us to do. We have had the opportunity to retire five of the 10 coal units. We've been able to maintain our rates. They're some of the lowest in the country, but the reality is we still need those five coal units to keep the system stable. Our utilities implement policy consistent with the needs of their stakeholders, their customers, and respecting what's required by any of the federal standards.



**Q31. Quick: What ultimately led to the end of your healthcare venture with JP Morgan and Amazon?**



Buffett: We spend close to 20% of GDP on health. People generally like their doctor, didn't like the system. But in the end, JP Morgan and Amazon and Berkshire were not going to have any effect on changing the 20%. Other countries spend 6 or 7% of GDP. The system was too entrenched to really do much in the way of change. Our costs were far higher than Canada, France, or Britain, and to some extent, we were subsidizing the rest of the world. People would come to the United States to do the really unusual or challenging aspects of health in terms of operations. When you have 20% of GDP going into a given industry, it will have political power. We are a very rich country. So we can do things other countries can't do. It's easy to spend money, and it's hard to cut people's receipts. It's so much better to live here than it was 100 years ago or 200 years ago.



**Q32. Audience: You mentioned that Greg will be in charge of capital allocation in the future. Is it easier for a business operator to be an investor or for an investor to be a business operator?**



Buffett: It's a lot tougher to be an operator. It's easier to sit in a room like I do and play around with money. It is an easier life. I've been able to choose my friends. I've never had to work for anybody that I didn't admire. I had 5 different people I worked for, and they were fantastic. I've been able to choose what I do with my day as compared to being a business operator. I can run the kind of company I want to run, and that's an extraordinary luxury.



Buffett: The time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year-end. I would still hang around and could conceivably be useful in a few cases. But the final word would be what Greg said, in operations, in capital deployment, whatever it might be. The board would be more welcome to giving him more authority on large acquisitions probably if they knew I was around. I have no intention, zero, of selling one share of Berkshire Hathaway - it will be given away. The decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg's management than mine. Thanks for coming. The enthusiasm shown by the audience's response can be interpreted in two ways. But I'll take It as positive. Thank you.



**Meeting Adjourned**



In conclusion, the highlight of the meeting occurred at the end when Warren Buffett announced he was stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway on December 31. Greg Abel would then become CEO. Although the timing of this announcement was a surprise, Buffett will be 95 on August 30, and Abel had previously been designated by Buffett to succeed him. Abel has been with Berkshire for over 25 years and has been successfully running all of Berkshire's non-insurance operations since January 2018 as Vice Chairman.



In my opinion, the outlook for Berkshire is very bright, with its most important business, Geico, having been turned around with price matching risk more closely and telematics being successfully introduced.



Berkshire's $20 billion investments in the five Japanese trading companies over the past six years is working out very well. Its over $300 billion in cash should enable Berkshire to take advantage of the next sharp stock market decline and make investments at much lower prices.



Since its May 3 annual meeting, Berkshire's shares have declined by 14%, underperforming the S&amp;P 500 (+12%) by 26 percentage points. This has resulted in Berkshire now trading close to its historical price-to-book value of 1.5, which presents an attractive entry point for investors.

[**OPEN (Open Door Technologies)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OPEN&amp;p=d)\-Rallied with the stock surging nearly 40% on Friday, it seems like it happened mainly due to the rate cut news (and thus real estate prices boom). Interested in the $6 level, more short biased and currently short $6 calls expiring EOW- I'm mainly thinking of covering today/tomorrow if we break $5. Premarket seems to be biased for towards sellers as well. Overall, the stock is pretty liquid so I don't have trouble getting the size I want, especially in shares.

Tariffs are expected to be finalized within 50 days. We saw a pretty decently sized bounce yesterday after Friday's AH selloff, watching for continuation today. I'm mainly interested in W, but ultimately trying to be agile in both directions because I don't have any strong opinion on this. Companies sourcing heavily from overseas are at greatest risk, (Wayfair sources heavily from the cursory research I've done). Mainly interested in the $70 level for W. 

[**CSX (CSX Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CSX&amp;p=d)\-Buffett/BRK clarified that no merger talks are underway, CSX states that they're open to a potential deal. It had initially moved up speculation of consolidation in the rail sector. Interested in seeing if we can break lows and sell off further today- overall doesn't seem like this is likely though, considering this news hit mid-day and we've had rest of the day for information digestion. Buffett obviously has a heavy hand in the stocks he's involved in (like UNH).

CSX-BNSF railroad pact lessens expectations of quick merger, analysts say
By Sabrina Valle


Aug 22 (Reuters) - CSX (CSX.O), opens new tab and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), opens new tab-owned BNSF on Friday announced new coast-to-coast services, a move that strengthens their freight connectivity but that tempers market expectations of an imminent merger between the two rail giants.
Shares of CSX closed 3.6% lower after the announcement, but are up almost 8% so far this year.

U.S. railroad leader Union Pacific (UNP.N), opens new tab and Norfolk Southern (NSC.N), opens new tab last month announced a surprise $85 billion merger proposal, fueling speculation that CSX and BNSF - the United States' two other major freight railroads - might explore a merger of their own.


""This announcement signals BNSF's low appetite for a merger"" in the near term, said BMO Capital Markets transportation analyst Fadi Chamoun. ""Perhaps the company is not convinced on the merits of full-on consolidation and will be patient.""
If granted regulatory approval – a process that could take more than 18 months – the UP-Norfolk merger would create the first coast-to-coast freight rail operator in the United States.

""We view the announcement today as confirmation that BNSF and CSX will wait to see how the Union Pacific/Norfolk Southern regulatory path unfolds from here,"" said Evercore Transport analyst Jonathan Chappell.
Friday's announcement stems from ongoing commercial agreements between rail operators and predates last month’s merger announcement, according to a person familiar with the agreement.
The new routes will link Southern California with Charlotte, North Carolina, and Jacksonville, Florida.


Commercial agreements between freight rail operators are common in the industry, allowing companies to expand service offerings without undergoing structural changes.
On July 21, CSX and Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CP.TO), opens new tab launched the Southeast Mexico Express, a new east-west Class 1 corridor that connects shippers across Mexico, Texas and the southeastern United States.
Union Pacific launched a similar domestic intermodal service earlier this month, connecting Southern California's Inland Empire with the Chicago area.


CSX is also under activist pressure from Ancora, which is pushing for a merger or leadership change, and Toms Capital Investment Management's request to meet with the railroad operator's board.
Better intermodal volumes helped CSX top analyst estimates for second-quarter profit in July.
Railroad operators have always eyed linking the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts by rail and this is especially true now, when the industry is struggling with labor constraints and higher operational expenses.",10,0,rvrduce,https://www.reddit.com/r/BerkshireHathaway/comments/1my2xmm/bnsf_and_csx_partnership/,1my2xmm

&gt;*Berkshire has ""so much cash now"" — a record $344 billion as of June 30 — that it's high time it returns some to shareholders via a dividend, Shields said. The conglomerate is ""hoarding"" the huge sum, he continued, and it's ""not doing anybody any good for that to just be sitting there.""*

&gt;

&gt;Shields said a dividend is ""quite likely"" under Abel. He also suggested there could be a spike in employee turnover among staff who might not feel the same commitment toward the new boss.

So, this veteran BH analyst of 15 years thinks BH is hoarding and a dividend is coming under Abel. I would hope, given his credentials, that he understands why we don’t want a dividend and why we believe having a massive cash pile ain’t such a bad thing? And I mean investors overwhelmingly voted NO on the dividend, yeah?

&gt;A veteran analyst says he was stunned by Warren Buffett's decision to step down as [Berkshire Hathaway CEO](https://apple.news/Pw0g7N-b8VFrm0TpUutSJs6) this year — and told Business Insider what he expects to change under his successor, Greg Abel.

&gt;""I was shocked,"" Meyer Shields, a managing director at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods who's been covering Berkshire for more than 15 years, said in an interview.

Oh, and he’s “shocked” about this? Come on, the Oracle of Omaha is almost 95 Years old. Why is it so shocking that he is handing over the reigns at the time he deems appropriate?

I found the article to be pretty silly so I probably should have tagged it as Humor. Not much more to say but I’ll end with a couple  BH quotes I guess:

&gt;Forecasts may tell you a great deal about the forecaster; they tell you nothing about the future.

&gt;People have always had this craving to have someone tell them the future. Long ago, kings would hire people to read sheep guts. There’s always been a market for people who pretend to know the future. Listening to today’s forecasters is just as crazy as when the king hired the guy to look at the sheep guts.

2025-08-21 16:38:22,r/BerkshireHathaway,How to think of the price floor for Berkshire Hathaway.,"Hi

The price floor of Berkshire Hathaway is the price which the company will come in and start buying back the shares. 

Before 2018, the company bought back shares at 1.2x of Book value. Book value was deemed at that time a good metric to track because it was a holding company of a collection of businesses. In the Owners Manual on the Berkshire Hathaway website, they mentioned Book Value as a then suitable metric. 

From 2018, the company has bought back shares from 1.2x all the way to 1.55x. In 2020 to 2021 where 50bn of Berkshire Stock was purchased, the price to book was around 1.2 to 1.4x.

In 2023 to 2024 where the price to book was 1.5 to 1.6, there were no buybacks.

I therefore think that at around 1.4x of book value, there is high chance that Berkshire will buy back its shares.

( Of course, there is a chance that Buffett has modified the criteria on valuation to use another metric other than Book value, as he mentioned in 2018 that Book value might not be the most accurate measure of fair value for Berkshire Hathaway.)

——

Anyway, the current bookvalue per share of BRK.b is $309.6, at 1.4x the price is 309.6*1.4=433.44. 

I conclude that $433.44 is the price floor.



——

In a previous post a couple of months ago, I gave a number of 470+ as the floor, well I would consider today’s 433.44 to be more accurate. [What changed is the more detailed explanation I received.](https://www.reddit.com/u/raytoei/s/ZBV0FiLB7Y)

This helps with keeping control of voting rights in the “right” hands.

By Steven M. Sears

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/warren-buffett-berkshire-stock-buy-53fe63f5](https://www.barrons.com/articles/warren-buffett-berkshire-stock-buy-53fe63f5)

At a time in the stock market when it is hard to buy a great company at a good price, Berkshire Hathaway merits consideration.

Berkshire is trading at about 11 times earnings, even as many other admired companies are trading at higher multiples.

The valuation disconnect indicates that Berkshire is getting little credit for significant stakes in some of the world’s most respected, profitable companies, including Apple, American Express , Coca-Cola,  Occidental Petroleum, Moody’s, and Chubb. Berkshire also has substantial operations in insurance and reinsurance, utilities and energy, freight rail transportation, and retailing.

Berkshire’s stock price doesn’t fully reflect the company’s strength because investors are overweighting a simple fact: that Berkshire’s legendary CEO, Warren Buffett, is mortal like all of us.

2025-08-12 04:47:17,r/BerkshireHathaway,Berkshire Acquisition: Bell Labs,"https://www.pctonline.com/news/bell-laboratories-acquired-berkshire-hathaway/


WINDSOR, Wis. – Bell Laboratories announced it has been acquired by Berkshire Hathaway. The transaction closed on July 31.

The acquisition marks a new chapter in Bell Laboratories’ history. Bell Laboratories said it remains committed to delivering high-quality products and services to customers worldwide. Under Berkshire Hathaway ownership, Bell will continue to operate independently, maintaining its leadership, culture and strategic direction.

Bell Laboratories welcomed Warren Buffett, Greg Abel, Howard Buffett and members of the Berkshire Hathaway team to its corporate headquarters Aug. 4. In a conversation between Bell President and CEO Steve Levy and Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett, Buffett congratulated the company on its 50-year legacy and offered his perspective on its future.

“Mr. Buffett congratulated Bell on 50 years of success,” Levy said. “He shared that, because of this transaction, Bell can expect to be around for the next 50 years.”


Patrick Lynch, chief commercial officer of Bell and president of Bell Sensing, said the company is excited to welcome Berkshire Hathaway to the pest control industry.

“Due to Berkshire’s commitment to maintaining our leadership and culture, we are happy to reassure our partners that Bell will continue to lead our industry, providing the widest breadth and highest quality rodent control tools on the market,” Lynch said.


Bell Laboratories was founded in 1974 by Malcolm Stack, who launched the business following a successful career managing a pesticide formulation business. Following his passing in 2006, the company had been solely owned by his daughters, Linda Hughes and Anne Connor, both of whom are now nearing retirement age. The sale to Berkshire Hathaway marks the first change of ownership from the Stack family.

Bell Laboratories said it remains committed to delivering innovative, science-driven rodent control solutions while upholding the values that have defined the company since its founding. Levy said, “We are grateful for the enduring commitment the Malcolm Stack family has made to the pest control industry, and we look forward to building on that legacy in partnership with Berkshire Hathaway.”

Early Reaction from Industry Distributors
PCT reached out to industry stakeholders and their reaction to the news Bell Laboratories had been sold to Berkshire Hathaway has been positive.

Berkshire Hathaway, led by legendary investor Warren Buffett, is synonymous with the buy-and-hold investment strategy, holding investments for a long period of time.

Tommy Reeves, vice president of distributor Oldham Chemicals Co., said he is optimistic about Bell Laboratories’ future because Berkshire Hathaway is a reputable investment firm with a solid track record. “It could’ve been acquired by other investors who might have quickly flipped the company, but Berkshire tends to take a longer-term approach. That gives me confidence in the future of Bell.”

From a distributor perspective, Reeves does not expect any changes to product pricing and availability as well as quality control, innovation or R&amp;D. “I expect a steady supply and consistency in the quality Bell Labs has maintained for the past 50 years,” he said.

Reeves said it will be interesting to see if the Bell Laboratories acquisition will be a gateway to other pest control industry acquisitions for Berkshire Hathaway. “Honestly, I’d welcome Berkshire acquiring other vendors. They seem like good people,” he said.

Another industry distributor told PCT off the record he was not surprised by the announcement. “Investors continue to look for investments with a solid return, and that is not lost on Berkshire Hathaway,” he said. “The rodent category continues to grow and grow.”

He added that “Bell Labs is a ‘well run machine’ with ‘outstanding people.’”

PCT will update our coverage on this industry development. — Brad Harbison and Jodi Dorsch

2025-08-11 10:29:46,r/BerkshireHathaway,Buyback party everywhere… except BRK? Will they finally join in?,"So apparently 2025 is turning into a full-on **buyback festival**.

* YTD announced buybacks: **$983.6B** 🤯
* On track to break **$1.1T** for the year
* Tech &amp; big banks leading the charge — Apple ($100B), Alphabet ($70B), JPM ($50B), BAC ($40B), Morgan Stanley ($20B)… you get the picture.

But here’s the thing:  
📉 **Berkshire Hathaway hasn’t bought back stock in 4 straight quarters**.  
Meanwhile, their cash pile is now sitting at **$344B** (yes, with a “B”).

Larry Fink even came out saying companies should balance buybacks with long-term investments — and we know Buffett’s been picky about when BRK repurchases.

So here’s my question:  
💭 With buybacks basically becoming a market-wide flex right now…

* Does anyone think BRK will finally step in this quarter?
* Or will Buffett just keep stacking cash until valuations drop?
* Is this just him waiting for a “fat pitch” like in 2020?

Personally, I’m torn — the market’s hyped on buybacks, and a BRK announcement could be a big catalyst… but Buffett’s track record says he won’t chase.

Curious to hear how you all are reading this. If the buyback wave keeps pushing the S&amp;P, does BRK stay on the sidelines or join the party? 🥳🍿

2025-08-09 02:13:51,r/BerkshireHathaway,I have a few questions about Berkshire,"I have some questions that I can’t find answers on after searching and I am wondering if anyone has any ideas. 

Warren Buffett said one of his first mistakes after acquiring 39 percent of BRK in the early 1960s to fire Seabury, he bought a great insurance company NICO that was very profitable but instead of buying it under Buffett Partnership he bought it under Berkshire. 

The owner wanted to sell it directly to Warren but Warren opted to buy it under Berkshire Hathaway and Warren said himself “if BPL bought it themselves him and his partners would have owned 100 percent of a great business, instead they only ended up owning a portion of the business giving the other 61 percent of the legacy Berkshire holders a profitable company that eventually diverted 100 billion dollars from Buffet and partners” 

So my question is, after that mistake why did he continue to make Berkshire into a conglomerate buying more and more businesses under Berkshire? 

I feel like if he realized it so soon that he just made a huge mistake he wouldn’t have repeated it and today we would only know about Buffet and partners not Berkshire. 

So why did he keep making the same mistakes? 

Second question I’m curious about that I found no information on, out of the 61 percent I’m sure many sold and Warren or other insiders acquired shares from people/companies but I’m wondering if there are any legacy holders from the 1950s that just never sold and still kept the shares in their families for the last 70+ years?

I'm Anand, and for the past six years, value investing has been more than just an interest – it's been a true passion and a relentless journey. I've devoured over **80 books** on the subject, consumed countless hours of content on **Warren Buffett** *and* **Charlie Munger**, and painstakingly built my own portfolio from the ground up, trying to apply their timeless principles.

Throughout this journey, I found myself constantly wishing for a tool that genuinely helped in the analysis process, one that was built specifically with the value investor's mindset in mind – **focusing on fundamentals and intrinsic value, not the distractions of Beta, charts, or technical analysis** often found on flashy trading platforms. So, I started building one.

It's been a labor of love, designed to help apply some of those core Buffett-Munger principles to dissect businesses and manage a portfolio more effectively. **It's completely free to use**, and my primary goal right now isn't promotion, but genuine **feedback from this incredible community.**

I've put a lot of thought and personal experience into its development, and I truly believe it could be a valuable resource for fellow value investors. But to make it truly great, I need your fresh eyes and insights.

If you're willing to take a look and perhaps integrate it into your analysis workflow, please use it for free. **(It uses secure Google login for simplicity and peace of mind).** I'd be incredibly grateful if you could share your thoughts, criticisms, and suggestions.

2025-08-08 17:34:11,r/BerkshireHathaway,"I have a theory, the underlying company’s although profitable are actually forward economic indicators","I always wondered why Buffett mentioned a long time ago in one of the shareholder meetings why it’s good for Berkshire but not necessarily other investors who try to copy his investments and I think there may be a thought hierarchy going on.

First of course Buffett needs to understand the business, then the business needs to make money in order to be self sustaining, and third the business has to be able to provide some relevant economic indicator to general market health. This to me explains why Buffett has investments like Sees Candies and Coca Cola as well as American Express, Bank of America, and Hanes underwear. 

I dare someone smarter than me to poke holes in my theory.

Would you have put in what you have put in into a partnership where you are never quoted a price and it's pretty difficult to sell your stake?

My suggestion is estimating how much money you are willing to put into an actual partnership. Open an account in another brokerage account, buy BRK and never look at it.

***Disclaimer***: Parts of this post were organized with the help of AI (Notebook LM) to structure the content, but all ideas and final wording reflect my own perspective.

After reading countless posts, comments, and articles across different platforms questioning Berkshire’s approach, I decided to look back at history to see if there were patterns I could relate to — much like Munger and Buffett often did when people questioned why they weren’t following the herd

-----------------

Berkshire Hathaway in 1999: The Underperformance

Back in 1999, the dot‑com bubble was in full swing. The market was obsessed with anything tied to the “new economy,” and tech stocks were blasting off. The NASDAQ surged an eye‑popping 85.6% that year, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 19.5%.

Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway — with its insurance businesses, utility holdings, and Coca‑Cola — looked like a relic from another era. Warren's value‑driven approach was openly mocked. Barron’s even ran a now‑famous cover in December 1999, “What’s Wrong, Warren?”, questioning whether he’d lost his magic touch.

That year, Berkshire’s book value per share inched up just 0.5%, while the S&amp;P 500 rose 21%. By market standards, Buffett was miles behind.


-----


Then the bubble popped. From 2000 to 2002:

The NASDAQ collapsed by over 75% from its peak.

The S&amp;P 500 fell more than 37%.

Berkshire Hathaway? It climbed over 32% in the same period.


When reality set back in, Berkshire’s so‑called “boring” portfolio — with its dependable cash flow and fortress balance sheet — proved its worth. While speculative high‑flyers burned to the ground, Berkshire quietly did what it had always done: compound value steadily.

***Why This Feels Familiar Today***

Fast‑forward to now. The AI boom is fueling a massive rally in a small group of tech names, sort of similar of the dot‑com era. These few companies are carrying much of the market’s gains, and once again, “old economy” names like Berkshire are seen as lagging behind.

Here’s the pattern worth remembering:

1. Underperformance: In speculative surges, Berkshire will often lag the headline indexes. The noise grows louder, with critics questioning its relevance.

2. Patience: Buffett’s strategy — and now Greg Abel’s — hasn’t changed: wait for fat pitches, hold cash when valuations are silly, and keep building the underlying businesses.

3. Reversion: Eventually, speculation cools or the economy turns. That’s when investors rediscover the comfort of companies with strong fundamentals, durable advantages, and predictable earnings.

2025-08-05 01:55:53,r/BerkshireHathaway,Ignoring recent drops. What’s the reason it shot up during the crash.,"We all saw Berk hit 530 or whatever during that mass panic months ago. It’s apparently because everyone saw Berk as a safe haven during uncertainty. 

That being said is the idea here that if everything were to crash or become uncertain, Berk would receive tons of buy-ins and soar back upward? 

Or do you think sentiment has changed since those fleeing people are now bag holding and wouldn’t dare recommend fleeing to Berk during a crash. Wouldn’t it be overvalued again at 530 despite its “public sentiment” value making it “worth it” as a safe haven of steady assets during uncertainty.

As it stands now sentiment in here is that the stock would now drop more if the market shook. Despite recent events showing that it might inverse a crash off of its reputation alone.

2025-08-05 00:11:18,r/BerkshireHathaway,"How Value Investing Works, an Example","Just want to use an extreme buy back example to demonstrate why value investing works. Not that it's superior, not that other investing methods don't work. Just want to show that investors don't need to panic because of the recent price movements.  
  
Suppose Berkshire's market cap drops to $400B, this example will show how Berkshire can use $200B cash to buy back half the company to take advantage of the price movement. And this is like the whole point of value investing, to give cash back to investors.

**1. How the buy back will increase FCF per share.**

If you scroll to page 7 of this quarter's report, [https://berkshirehathaway.com/qtrly/2ndqtr25.pdf](https://berkshirehathaway.com/qtrly/2ndqtr25.pdf)

You can see ""Net cash flows from operating activities"" = \~$21B. I will add back ""Discount accretion on investments, principally U.S. Treasury Bills"" which is $6.2B since this is just treasury appreciation, I will assume Berkshire took the money out. This comes to $27.2B.

This is not FCF, people substract capital expenditure from it to get FCF. All of the ""cash flows from investing activities"" are just buying and selling securities except for ""Purchases of property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease"" which is capex (\~$9.1B), so **the FCF is roughly $27.2B-$9.1B \~ $18.1B. So a full year's FCF is roughly $36B which is the money Berkshire can use for buy back and dividend without touching its equity holdings.**

If we use $200B to do buy back half of the company, we will substract $200B\*3.85% = $7.7B from FCF (loss of treasury bills), FCF will become 36-7.7 \~ $28.3B. So the FCF per share will goes from 36B/(number of shares) to 28.3B/(number of shares\*0.5) which means it goes up by 57%. 

**2. The buy back will double the equity holding per share.**

So the conclusion is, if nothing is really happening to the business, pray for the price to drop to this level because we will all become immensely rich. But you need to be able to hold. And don't let anybody tell you value investing is anything other than putting in money to get more back, the only purpose!",9,0,Yangguang_Zhijia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BerkshireHathaway/comments/1mhrgig/how_value_investing_works_an_example/,1mhrgig

2025-08-04 22:49:34,r/BerkshireHathaway,Getting educated,"Here is my advice to everyone who wants to buy and hold berkshire:

Spend some time, the longer the better, not invested in Berkshire, maybe a tiny position just to keep track. During that time, read all the material you can directly from Berkshires website. Read the annual reports, the letters, watch the annual meetings. 

What youll realize is that if you trust the decision management process of the management team, you wont even notice declines like this.

I have a large amount invested in Berkshire, and I didnt even know of the drawdown before i started reading these doom posts and comments. 

Guys, please educate yourselves. Investing is fucking hard. A lot of very smart people fail miserably. 

Stay humble and respect the fact that there is ALOT that you dont know. But as you learn, with time and reading, your conviction in this company will grow so strong you'll feel it in your bones.

Its a rich people cult, in some weird way.

They said well, Berk has always been the responsible company. 
They saw it weathering the storm and up when everything else was down, they said “well shit they always say don’t try to time the stocks” and just put their money in around $520.
They saw it go up a bit more, felt safe.

Then watched it drop off a cliff.

Odds are they put most of their savings in figuring that was “the mature thing to do” and collect what they heard was meager, but steady  and healthy earnings over time.

Instead they got a slow bleed into a meme stock level loss on their large investment.
Now they feel stupid and are thinking of how anything was better than this and why this keeps happening to them.

2025-08-03 07:15:30,r/BerkshireHathaway,Q2 earnings : analysis this morning from Forbes mag.,"I came across a long article this morning in Forbes. Just copy paste the conclusion below :
——-
While Berkshire’s quarterly operating earnings were down modestly year-over-year, there were some pleasant surprises in the data. Excluding insurance and the other segment, which is heavily impacted by foreign exchange volatility, operating profits grew 13% year-over-year. The BNSF railroad made significant progress in improving productivity to drive higher profits. The manufacturing, service, and retailing segment was surprisingly resilient with 12% year-over-year operating earnings growth. Lastly, one of Berkshire’s crown jewels, GEICO, seems to be back in profitable growth mode with policies in force continuing to rise.
——-

My thoughts : Looks to me the Kraft depreciation was already expected and priced. For the insurance business , 2024 was exceptional  and one of a kind , and nobody was expecting the same kind of performance. 
For a conglomerate this size, 400k employees and hundreds of businesses, heavily exposed to tariffs and supply chains. shocks, and considering the current “unstable” environment I think those earnings are very reassuring

2025-08-02 20:37:03,r/BerkshireHathaway,Berkshire's operation earning,"A lot of freak events happened in 2025, that's why we are seeing a decline in Berkshire's operating earning.

FX: 2024 Q2, $446M gain, 2025 Q2, $877M loss  
Disastrous events: 2024 H1, none, 2025 H1, $850M loss (I'm not sure how this is accounted for in different quarters, so will ignore)

Adjusting for FX, the underlying operating earning:
2025 Q2              2024 Q2  
Insurance Underwriting                     1992                   2263  
Insurance Investment                        3367                  3320  
BNSF                                                    1466                  1227  
BHE                                                       702                    655  
Manufacturing, service &amp; retailing      3601                 3380  
Other                                                      32                      753  
Adjustment for FX                                 877                    -446  
Sum                                                        12037 (+7.9%)                11152

So the adjusted operating earning grew at least 7.9% YoY, if we count for the SolCal fire, the growth was higher. And this is with that huge pile of cash (notice the investment income didn't change). So I will venture to say that the business is pretty healthy.",31,5,Yangguang_Zhijia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BerkshireHathaway/comments/1mfxu59/berkshires_operation_earning/,1mfxu59
2025-08-02 20:01:11,r/BerkshireHathaway,Here is the real question that needs to be answered.,"Berkshire is sitting on a mound of cash to the tune of around $340B.  What we know is that Trump is about to stack the Fed and bring down short term rates.  A lot of the earnings right now come from treasury bill interest and they refuse to invest in anything, including our own shares.  So, if nothing else changes a year from now you would assume earnings are going to start declining.  On the operating side there really isn't a lot of other growth that can make up the losses from a big hit to treasury interest.  

  
Here is the question.  Will they just sit idly by and watch earnings stay flat or decline, waiting on the big crash?   Or will the new guy take the massive cash pile and try to do something with it?  Buffett isn't giving any more interviews and the new guy isn't at the helm yet.   So it's likely we won't get any answers soon.  Since Buffett isn't talking I would like to see Able on CNBC and other shows talking about the company and engaging the investors and others.",65,23,JP2205,https://www.reddit.com/r/BerkshireHathaway/comments/1mfwzh6/here_is_the_real_question_that_needs_to_be/,1mfwzh6

•	Net income: $12.37B vs $30.348B YoY （ much lower than last yr but exceeding expectations.）

2025-07-31 14:37:56,r/BerkshireHathaway,Greg Abel and Berkshire Hathaway: The Quiet Power Behind the AI Race,"I’ve seen a lot of posts and chatter lately about the “Warren premium” fading and some doubt around Greg Abel. Just wanted to share a quick post in support. 

Edit: I used NotebookLM to get my thoughts and phrase it for simplicity


While the headlines are focused on the ""AI arms race"" between the US and China—a competition often framed in terms of who can develop the most advanced large language models, chips, and military applications—there's a crucial, often overlooked, dimension: the infrastructure that powers it all. And this is where Greg Abel and Berkshire Hathaway's strategy becomes so brilliantly relevant.


The ""Arms Race"" is really an ""Energy Race""
The development of AI isn't just about software; it's about hardware, and that hardware consumes immense amounts of power. Data centers, which are the backbone of all AI, are voracious energy consumers. The US government and tech giants alike are scrambling to build more data centers to cement American leadership in AI. This is where the core of Abel's expertise lies.
Greg Abel, as the long-time head of Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE), has spent his career managing and expanding one of the largest utility and energy infrastructure companies in North America. He understands the complex economics of power generation, transmission, and the intricate regulatory frameworks that govern it.
Berkshire's Role in National Security


The US's ability to ""win"" the AI race, both commercially and from a national security standpoint, is directly tied to its ability to provide cheap, reliable, and abundant energy. Without it, the most advanced AI models and defense systems can't function.
Under Abel's leadership, Berkshire Hathaway isn't trying to build the next ChatGPT or competing with NVIDIA. Instead, it's positioning itself as the indispensable foundation upon which the entire AI industry is built. By investing in and expanding its energy grid, BHE is enabling the very data centers that are critical to both tech companies and the government's AI initiatives. This is a far more stable, long-term, and strategically vital role than chasing the latest tech fad.


In a world where geopolitical power is increasingly measured by technological supremacy, Berkshire's strategic focus on energy infrastructure under Abel's guidance is not just a smart business decision—it's a critical component of American competitiveness. Buffett and Munger chose Abel not just for his business acumen, but because they saw that the future of power, and thus the future of technology and national security, would be in the hands of those who could literally keep the lights on.

2025-07-31 08:03:09,r/BerkshireHathaway,For those crying that Berkshire Hathaway doesn't invest in AI.,"I'll channel my inner Charlie Munger here: 

That is some astronomically *dumb* levels of first-order thinking.

What does AI require the most?

*Power.*

LLMs &amp; cloud infrastructure is driving an insane demand for energy, particularly through hyperscale data centres. Specifically, AI workloads like GPT model training are significantly more power-intensive than traditional cloud tasks. 

Right now, the U.S is experiencing a surge in data centre construction; this mostly occurs in states with abundant and stable power grids - like Nevada, Iowa and most of the West.

Guess where Berkshire Hathaway Energy operates?

*All of the above.*

Berkshire Hathaway Energy's primary subsidiary (MidAmerican Energy) in Iowa is building Wind PRIME (a 2000+MW wind and solar project) - exactly the type of energy structure required to support AI data centre loads.

Not to mention NV Energy (another subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway) submitted filings in 2024 tied to Microsoft and Google data centre power requests exceeding 900MW. NV Energy serves power to Nevada (particularly the Reno area which is becoming a growing hub for AI and cloud infrastructure).

These are going to generate incredible cash flows &amp; earnings over a long period of time.

When most of these speculative Redditors think of AI; their immediate thoughts are any company that produces chips or an LLM model.

What about the energy that's going to be needed to power all of this infrastructure? Or all the HVAC infrastructure that's going to be required to keep these data centres cool; specifically in Nevada where temperatures can be pretty darn hot. I own stock in a company called Comfort FIX Systems USA that provides cooling infrastructure to commercial buildings &amp; data centres; the earnings have been incredible over the past couple of quarters.

So for those who are saying Berkshire is missing out on this 'AI Revolution' - think a bit deeper. There are going to be many beneficiaries from all this CapEx. In the 2024 10-K, the operating businesses marginally generated higher earnings than the insurance businesses. I think this gap will widen a lot more over time.

Oh, and by the way, guess who was the CEO of MidAmerican Energy / Berkshire Hathaway Energy for many many many years before being appointed to take over as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway next year?",282,22,Short-Philosophy-105,https://www.reddit.com/r/BerkshireHathaway/comments/1mdts9n/for_those_crying_that_berkshire_hathaway_doesnt/,1mdts9n

2025-07-21 08:37:05,r/BerkshireHathaway,Title: Buffett’s Japan Play vs. Political Meltdown — Should We Be Worried?,"Okay so here’s what’s got me thinking — Buffett raised a ton of cheap debt in Japan, basically 0% interest, and dumped a good chunk of it into Japanese trading houses (Mitsui, Itochu, etc.). It’s been a massive win so far. But now, Japan’s political scene is turning into a total circus.

The ruling coalition (LDP + Komeito) just got wrecked in the upper house elections, and now PM Shigeru Ishiba is on the chopping block. Dude might have to step down. Analysts are calling it a *triple disaster* — capital fleeing Japanese equities, yen getting whacked, and the whole Abenomics structure possibly collapsing.

Some are saying this might mess with the upcoming US-Japan tariff negotiations (only 10 days left before the deadline). Chris Weston even said that just **rumors** of the PM stepping down could be the “nuclear button” for shorting the yen.

Now I’m wondering — how does this all circle back to Buffett’s Japan exposure? Like, these trading houses are obviously tied into the broader economy and geopolitics. If foreign capital starts pulling out or things get real messy, does that put pressure on Buffett’s Japan bet? Or is he so long-term and hedged with the debt side that this just becomes noise？？",8,5,Past-Fly-2785,https://www.reddit.com/r/BerkshireHathaway/comments/1m5bngo/title_buffetts_japan_play_vs_political_meltdown/,1m5bngo

2025-07-17 01:38:53,r/BerkshireHathaway,To those concerned/panicking about Berkshire Hathaway's recent slump.,"Hi all.

In light of the recent price depreciation of Berkshire Hathaway shares, I see many investors and/or subredditors voicing their concerns particularly around the so-called “Buffett premium” and the company’s future leadership under Greg Abel. I’d like to share a perspective grounded in both Berkshire’s long-standing principles and the realities of its current positioning.

Greg Abel is not a newcomer to Berkshire Hathaway. He’s been a core part of its leadership for decades, having overseen large-scale capital allocation decisions, especially within Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger didn’t just casually endorse him; they handpicked him as Buffett’s successor, explicitly citing his competence, integrity, and capital allocation acumen. If we trust their decades-long emphasis on management quality as one of the most important facets of every Berkshire investment, *we should equally trust their decision when it comes to their own company*.

Buffett and Munger have long said that you want to build a company so durable that even an idiot could run it. While Abel is no idiot, Berkshire has been constructed with immense resilience + Buffett has obviously been making the moves to ensure Berkshire's longevity. The recent buildup of cash (now over $300 billion) isn’t just “dry powder” for Abel to deploy; it’s also a deliberate buffer - a safeguard. It ensures the company can withstand managerial missteps or macroeconomic shocks long after Buffett has stepped away.

As for the sell-off, it’s not solely due to the fading of Buffett’s shadow. There’s also broader negative sentiment around the Property and Casualty insurance sector. For instance, a major bank recently downgraded Progressive; Geico’s top competitor - only for Progressive to report stellar earnings today. This disconnect between perception and performance suggests the market is painting the entire insurance sector with too broad a brush.

Ironically, this fear creates an opportunity. According to Berkshire’s latest annual report, the company’s non-insurance businesses generated slightly higher operating profits than the insurance segment. That means the market’s bearishness on insurance is dragging down the valuation of high-quality, wholly owned subsidiaries, like BNSF, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and the manufacturing group, along with it. For long-term shareholders, this is not a reason to worry; it’s a reason to act.

Remember Buffett’s three most important words of investing - **margin of safety**. As a net buyer of Berkshire, you should be jumping for joy that the stock is currently on a sliding skid. It is now cheaper to purchase shares of a wonderful business that owns many, many fantastic subsidiaries. If you believe in the underlying fundamentals, the long-term opportunity has just become even more attractive.

And finally, if you are concerned with the every day price fluctuations of Berkshire Hathaway - unfortunately this is not the stock for you. Palantir might be a better place to deviate your eyes towards.",194,7,Short-Philosophy-105,https://www.reddit.com/r/BerkshireHathaway/comments/1m1s95n/to_those_concernedpanicking_about_berkshire/,1m1s95n

2025-07-15 02:29:51,r/BerkshireHathaway,The Case for Reverse Rebalancing: Charli and Warrens thoughts...,"**The Case for Reverse Rebalancing: Why Selling Your Weakest Ideas to Concentrate Your Best Bets Makes Sense**

Traditional portfolio rebalancing follows a simple rule: trim your winners and buy more of your losers to maintain a target allocations. But what if this conventional wisdom is backwards? What if the path to superior returns lies not in diversification maintenance, but in deliberately concentrating your capital into your highest-conviction ideas while systematically eliminating your weakest positions?

This contrarian approach—reverse rebalancing—challenges the foundational assumptions of modern portfolio theory and offers a compelling alternative for investors willing to trade broad diversification for focused conviction.

**The Flawed Logic of Traditional Rebalancing**

Standard rebalancing operates on the assumption that past performance is no indicator of future results, and that maintaining consistent exposure across asset classes or positions will optimize risk-adjusted returns over time. This approach systematically forces investors to sell their best-performing assets and purchase more of their worst performers.

The problem with this methodology becomes apparent when you consider that it treats all investments as equally valid ongoing propositions. In reality, your portfolio likely contains a spectrum of conviction levels—from your highest-confidence ""can't miss"" opportunities to positions you hold simply for diversification or because you haven't gotten around to selling them yet.

By maintaining equal or predetermined weightings across all positions, traditional rebalancing dilutes your capital allocation to ideas you're most excited about while maintaining exposure to investments that may have been mistakes from the start.

Copart is around 28% down from its ATH, with the lowest stock price since January 2024. The stock is in a very long-term upward trend, it could drop below 200 EMA soon for the first time in ages though soon.

Berkshire is around 12% down from its ATH. It's a stock that you never get cheap, the last time it had such a drawdown was in 2023.

Hi, 

I wrote this to myself today (on my reddit page) , and I am copying it here. I am a long term holder of the b shares. And I never added since, until this week. (**correction** I probably added along the way)

**Commentary**

This week, i looked at some of the undervalued stocks that i owned:

\- **Brown Forman B**. [The long term growth is around 3%](https://www.reddit.com/user/raytoei/comments/1lw1nmb/brown_forman_cagr_growth_rates_over_last_9_years/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button), and using a next year's lowest EPS or an average of laste five year's EPS, i figured out that the IV of BF.B is somewhere between 30 to 40 and if i were to buy it below 30, i should be fine, for the long term.  

\- **Nike**. (I am still waiting for the financial statements to do a proper valuation.) My [previous valuation](https://www.reddit.com/user/raytoei/comments/1ln4vp5/one_way_of_valuing_nike/) puts it around $74 to $88. I was hoping to add meaningfully to it as it is only &lt;2% of my portfolio. 

\- **Google**. I opened a tracker position not too long ago.  The biggest risk is that this stock is too high profile and everyone is very emotive about it, masking the good and bad of investing in this company. And I was hoping to add more to make it in a full percent in my portfolio. 

\- **Berkshire Hathaway**.  [Regardless of what Buffett said in 2018](https://www.reddit.com/user/raytoei/comments/1ki7rr2/berkshire_hathaway_valuation_notes_to_myself/), i still think using BV is a decent way to approximate the value of Berkshire Hathaway. 

\-----

When i compared these four companies, it became apparent which one was the ""safest"" in terms of adverse company issues, and i started to buy at $478 to the present $475.  The next stop will be at $450 where i will to buy in larger chunks.  The upsides are plenty: share buyback, a special one time dividend payout etc. This is very apparent to me, and i am very convinced since no one is talking about it.",30,5,raytoei,https://www.reddit.com/r/BerkshireHathaway/comments/1lxo7m6/a_comment/,1lxo7m6

What we’ve been experiencing over the last quarter hasn’t been easy. It’s definitely not for the faint of heart, especially for those of us nearing retirement or already counting on our investments for peace of mind. The recent pullback can feel like a punch in the gut.

Berkshire shares drop double digits as 'Buffett premium' disappears https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/19/berkshire-shares-drop-double-digits-as-buffett-premium-disappears.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard

Warren Buffett once predicted that Berkshire Hathaway stock would rise when he eventually steps down. So far, the opposite has happened.

Since May 3, when the “Oracle of Omaha” announced his plans to hand over the reins, the stock of his conglomerate has fallen more than 10%, underperforming the S&amp;P 500 by about 15 percentage points.

The sell-off partially reflects the so-called Buffett premium, or the extra price investors are willing to pay because of the billionaire’s unmatched record and exceptional capital allocation skills.

“I am actually surprised at the magnitude of Berkshire’s underperformance … especially since Buffett is not stepping down as CEO until Dec. 31,” said David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland and a longtime Berkshire shareholder. “This relative decline may approach as much as 20% in the weeks ahead as some shareholders may become discouraged by Berkshire’s recent price performance.”

Berkshire Hathaway class A shares since Buffett announcement
Buffett said he decided to step down as CEO while remaining as chairman of the board after experiencing the physical effects of aging. The investing legend expressed his confidence in his successor Greg Abel’s ability to carry on Berkshire’s culture, which Buffett built so meticulously.

Part of the reason for the poor performance of the stock could be attributed to Berkshire’s first-quarter earnings decline. Operating earnings, which include the conglomerate’s fully owned insurance and railroad businesses, fell 14% to $9.64 billion during the first three months of the year.

“I think the first couple days after the announcement were definitely related to the Buffett premium,” said Kevin Heal, a Berkshire analyst at Argus Research. “Also of the mindset that it was heavily algo related. Later moves down I believe were due to the underlying assets both public and private.”

Meyer Shields, a Berkshire analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, said his rough guess is that there is still a 5% to 10% Buffett premium in the stock, reflecting some investors’ confidence that he’ll still be there as chairman. 

Kass said there may be an additional decline in the shares after Buffett departs at the year’s end.

HERE’S $20 MILLION IN MY HUSBAND’S NAME. PLUS A NOTE FROM WARREN BUFFETT

The Music Academy of the West has just bought itself a plot for a year-round Music Education Center.

The purchase was facilitated by a $20 million gift from Cheryl Goldberg (pictured), in memory of her husband, Michael Goldberg, a Berkshire Hathaway executive.

She said: ‘This gift honors not only the Music Academy’s extraordinary mission and its desire to increase access to music education in Santa Barbara. It is also a tribute to the memory of my beloved husband, Michael, whose legacy lives on through the countless lives this center will touch.’

Buffett added: ‘Mike’s role at Berkshire was monumental. I had made many mistakes in staffing the insurance business and he not only corrected them—he single-handedly created the world’s best team. Berkshire would be nothing like it is today without Mike.’

Apple (26%): 45
Bank of America (10%): 1.23
Coca Cola (11%): 11.89
American Express (16%): 6.73

The oil companies are closer to P/B of 1.4 which makes sense since they are asset heavy.

However, with most of the top companies today being valued based on tech instead of hard assets. Is BRK’s historical reliance on P/B as fair value still relevant?

By Heather Gillers

June 1, 2025, 11:00 pm EDT

Now that Warren Buffett has said Greg Abel will succeed him as Berkshire Hathaway’s CEO at year-end, Berkshire watchers are turning their attention to a different succession mystery: Who will fill Ajit Jain’s shoes? 

For nearly four decades, Jain has been the brains behind Berkshire’s insurance powerhouse. Its profits have helped Buffett expand his conglomerate and seed his stock portfolio. A risk-pricing mastermind, Jain has crafted policies insuring Chicago’s tallest building against terrorist attacks, Pepsi against having to award a $1 billion raffle prize, and baseball teams in the event that star players such as Alex Rodriguez got hurt. Along the way, he has made Berkshire billions of dollars.  

“Even kryptonite bounces off Ajit,” Buffett once wrote. But Berkshire’s man of steel (and statutory accounting) is now 73, and last year Jain said he gave Berkshire’s board a shortlist of possible successors. Whoever follows Jain will inherit a business in transition. New competitors are moving in. Berkshire’s biggest insurance moneymaker in recent years has been auto coverage.

Buffett and Jain declined to comment for this article, and Berkshire hasn’t disclosed the names on Jain’s list. But insurance-industry insiders have some ideas.

**Joe Brandon**, CEO of Alleghany

Brandon, 66, is on his second stint at Berkshire after the company’s 2022 purchase of Alleghany, a Berkshire-like conglomerate whose business spans insurance, steel fabrication and Squishmallow plush toys. He “understands both Berkshire and insurance,” Buffett said at the time of the purchase.

Brandon also spent seven years running General Re, one of Berkshire’s major providers of reinsurance, or insurance for insurance companies. He resigned in 2008 after federal prosecutors pressured Buffett to let him go following fraud convictions of four other former Gen Re executives. Brandon was never charged. 

**Todd Combs**, CEO of Geico

Combs, 54, already has two jobs: heading Geico and helping manage a portion of Berkshire’s investment capital. In five years leading the nation’s third-largest auto insurer by premiums, Combs has modernized Geico’s use of technology and shored up earnings and reserves. Buffett recently called the improvement “spectacular.”

Combs also has a record of Berkshire-like returns and Berkshire-style humility. He earned a net cumulative 34% while running a hedge fund from 2005 to 2010, a financial crisis-era period when the S&amp;P 500 produced 1.15%. Still he maintained such a low profile that when he accepted an investment manager job at Berkshire, the media couldn’t find a photo of him.

Combs’s experience insuring more unusual and expensive risks is limited, however, and some analysts believe his money management responsibilities could expand when Buffett retires.

**Peter Eastwood**, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance 

Since Buffett coaxed him away from AIG more than a decade ago, Eastwood, 58, has added a new arm to Berkshire’s commercial insurance operations, building property-casualty insurer BHSI from scratch. The company started in 2013, turned a profit within 15 months and has since built up more than $15 billion in reserves, according to a person familiar with the company. 

Buffett has called Eastwood’s hiring “a home run,” and BHSI now has offices across the U.S., Europe, Asia and Australia. Still, it is a smaller proving ground than some of the other companies in Berkshire’s insurance empire, such as National Indemnity Company and Gen Re.

**Kara Raiguel**, CEO of General Re 

Jain once called Raiguel, 52, his “secret weapon.” Practically a Berkshire lifer, she spent more than a decade working closely with him at Berkshire Hathaway’s reinsurance division in Stamford, Conn., helping evaluate some of the company’s biggest bets.

Raiguel took over Gen Re in 2016 and reserves have swelled. Ratings firm A.M. Best said in November Gen Re has taken “significant” actions toward bringing the prices policyholders pay better into line with the risk the firm takes on. 

**A tough act to follow**

Jain, who works from Berkshire’s reinsurance offices in Stamford, hasn’t said how long he plans to remain in his role. He grew up in India, earned an engineering degree and then sold early IBM computers before moving to the U.S. to attend Harvard Business School. Jain was still in his 30s, with no experience in the insurance industry, when Buffett hired him in 1986. Within six months, he was running Berkshire’s entire reinsurance business. He soon became known in the industry for his warm manner, his close listening ear and his willingness to say no if he can’t make money.

Jain’s meticulously priced deals brought in big lump sums, well beyond what Berkshire was getting from Geico’s plain-vanilla auto insurance business. There was enough cash to pay claims and plenty left over for Buffett to deploy. Most hotshot investors have to ask people for money; Berkshire just collects insurance premiums. That is why Buffett once advised shareholders—in the event of a shipwreck where they could rescue only one drowning Berkshire executive—to “swim to Ajit.”

Over the past decade, pension funds and other catastrophe bond investors have been displacing traditional property and casualty reinsurance capital, while private-equity firms have pushed into life insurance and annuities. Jain and Berkshire adapted by building out commercial insurers like Eastwood’s group and by whipping Geico into shape. The auto insurer’s underwriting earnings have outpaced all of Berkshire’s other insurance businesses combined for the past two years running. 

For Jain’s successor, the most important quality to replicate may be not his knack for making money but his talent for not losing it, said Christopher Bloomstran, chief investment officer of Semper Augustus Investments Group, a Berkshire investor. No other firm has the same capacity to pay for disaster recovery or bail out an underwater insurer. As long as Berkshire’s next insurance chief is also comfortable saying no, the cash pile Jain helped build—arguably his most important contribution to Berkshire—will long outlast him. 

Jain “is unique,” said Stephen Catlin, executive chairman of the specialty insurer and reinsurer Convex. “He will be a very hard act to follow.”

But given the # of investors (including nation-states) that don’t actively TRADE in the securities that they hold, I wonder what percentage of the FLOAT in the treasury market has been attributable to BRK transactions in recent times.
Is it possible that BRK, without saying it out loud, is intentionally contributing to keeping the U.S. government afloat by suppressing treasury yields with their cash pile?
Let’s face it, if the U.S. goes belly-up, or even just screws the pooch economically, that would be way worse for BRK than accepting modest reliable returns on their cash in lieu of putting it in more active investing.

Warren Buffett won't be on stage at 2026 meeting, Omaha newspaper reports

Warren Buffett will not appear on stage during the 2026 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, choosing instead to allow his successor, Greg Abel, to take center stage for the first time, the Omaha World-Herald reported on Sunday.

Buffett, 94, recently announced during the 2025 meeting that he plans to retire as chief executive at the end of the year, though he will remain as chairman of the board. As part of the transition, Abel is set to assume the chief executive role and lead the annual meeting in Buffett’s place, a move said to be made at Buffett’s own suggestion.

Rather than joining Abel on stage, Buffett will be seated with other board members during the event, which is scheduled for May 2 in Omaha.

Abel said Buffett remains deeply committed to the company, noting that Buffett intends to retain all of his Berkshire shares and eventually direct them into a charitable trust.

Susie Buffett, Buffett’s daughter and a member of the board, shared that her father believed it was time to step aside publicly and allow Abel to fully take the reins. She recalled him saying, “I’m not going to be up there. I’m going to leave it to Greg.”

While it’s uncertain whether the annual meeting will continue to attract its usual crowd of roughly 30,000 investors without Buffett on stage, Susie Buffett said many are still expected to attend out of curiosity to see how the event evolves in his absence.

Now that Warren retired, I want to know more about the new management of Berkshire, FROM THEIR OWN WORDS. I mean people like Greg Abel, Ajit, Ted Combs and Ted Weschler. How can I know that they are astute about seeing new risks on the horizon? 

A big reason for owning Berkshire was not just the expectation of slightly superior returns, but the knowledge that Warren was better at managing risk than me. Now I have doubts as to whether I have too many eggs in the Berkshire basket, so I am looking for assurance that the new people are thoughtful, visionary, careful etc.

“we will continue to have members of the Buffett family on the board. They are not there to run the business after I die, nor will they then receive compensation of any kind. Their purpose is to ensure, for both our shareholders and managers, that Berkshire’s special culture will be nurtured when I’m succeeded by other CEOs.”

2025-05-09 19:48:00,r/BerkshireHathaway,Warren Buffett and the Berkshire Hathaway Paradox - The Intellectual Investor,"I am back from what has become over the past two decades an annual pilgrimage to Omaha. 

What’s fascinating about this trip is that it has everything and nothing to do with Warren Buffett. The main event that draws everyone to Omaha – the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) annual meeting – is actually the least important part. I could have watched the shareholder meeting livestreamed on YouTube from the comfort of my living room couch.

The emergence of the Berkshire phenomenon reminds me of China’s manufacturing evolution. China initially attracted capital because of its cheap labor. But over time, China took this capital and plowed it into infrastructure. Factories were built next to each other, each specializing in certain areas. A specialized ecosystem emerged. 

Today, Chinese labor is no longer cheap. It’s been replaced by automation, and now China is a powerhouse for manufacturing anything and everything.

The transformation that the BRK weekend has undergone followed a similar progression. Initially, the only way to absorb Buffett and Munger’s wisdom was to come to Omaha, as the event was not streamed. But then something interesting happened. The BRK weekend attracted people who shared the same value system, and friendships were formed. A variety of smaller events began to be scheduled throughout the same weekend across Omaha, and an equally specialized ecosystem emerged.

The shareholder meeting began to be streamed about ten years ago, but that has had no impact on attendance. This is one reason why I think Buffett is at peace with the idea of no longer presiding at the meeting – people will still come to Omaha the weekend before Mother’s Day.

The BRK weekend now features dozens of excellent events. 

I spoke at several, including an investing panel at Creighton University, alongside the wonderful Bob Robotti, a die-hard value investor who runs Robotti &amp; Co. I’ve known Bob for years – at 72, he exhibits the same enthusiasm for stocks as someone decades younger – and this panel was an excellent example of what the BRK Omaha ecosystem has produced.

Bob and I have very different approaches to value investing. He loves cyclical businesses, while I generally shun them. Bob mentioned that he’d buy a very cheap business run by a mediocre manager, while I would not touch it with a ten-foot pole. 

There is absolutely nothing wrong with either approach; indeed, there is an important lesson in it. Your investment philosophy and process have to fit your personality and your EQ. In my case, I get nervous (and thus irrational) when I own companies run by imbeciles who don’t have either skin or soul in the game. But the great thing about the BRK weekend is that I learn from Bob every time I spend time with him. He’s a thoughtful and genuinely kind human being. 

From the outside, the BRK weekend may seem like a place where people simply want to learn how to get and stay rich. But this gathering transcends value investing and capitalism and genuinely celebrates human values. People (like me) bring their kids to this event. And just like at the main event, at the Q&amp;A breakfast I hosted for my readers, many questions centered on life rather than investing.

My first Omaha reader meetup fit around a small restaurant table. This year, to my surprise, 450 people packed into a venue with standing-room only. I answered questions on every imaginable topic for just over two hours, and by the end I was exhausted. 

This gave me even greater admiration for Buffett, who is four decades my senior, yet still fielded questions for four solid hours. I was delighted to hear Warren give a similar answer to one I had given the day before when asked what advice he’d give to graduating students: 

“Don’t worry too much about starting salaries and be very careful who you work for because you will take on the habits of the people around you.” 

(Incidentally, we are going to host our next Q&amp;A Breakfast on May 1, 2026. You can sign up for it [**here**](https://investor.fm/lets-get-together-in-omaha/). It’s free, but I suggest you sign up early, as it fills up fast.)

I also participated (as I have for over a decade) in an investing panel at YPO (Young President Organization) in the beautiful Holland Performance Art Center with Tom Gaynor, CEO of Markel (often described as a baby Berkshire Hathaway) and Lawrence Cunningham. Lawrence authored perhaps the most important book about Buffett, *The Essays of Warren Buffett,* masterfully editing Warren’s annual letters into a cohesive volume. This year’s panel was one of those occasions where I found myself listening intently to my fellow panelists instead of speaking more.

Lawrence has met Greg Abel – Buffett’s designated successor – and feels optimistic about him. He’s probably right – this was one of Buffett’s most crucial decisions, which he did not make lightly. Yet I can’t imagine sitting for four hours listening to Greg Abel. I am sure he is a brilliant CEO, but he’s neither Buffett nor Munger – few individuals possess so much worldly wisdom and communicate it with such clarity and humor.

This brings me to the point of this note: the dramatic (yet not unexpected) announcement that Buffett is stepping down as CEO of BRK at the end of the year.

Before I comment on this, let me tell you a story. Imagine you have been watching a soap opera for 17 years. You arrive dutifully every year to watch every episode in person. And then you miss the last five minutes of the explosive finale before it goes off the air. This is what happened to me when Buffett announced his retirement as CEO.

A few minutes before noon, while Buffett was answering a question I’d heard before and appeared to be winding down, I suggested we slip out early for lunch to avoid the crowds. When we came back, I discovered that the meeting had gone on until 1 pm, and just before it ended, Buffett announced that he would step down at the end of the year. Seventeen years of watching Warren speak and I missed the most dramatic moment of all, followed by a five-minute standing ovation.

I think Buffett has engineered his exit brilliantly. He will still remain chairman, and even before the announcement he was not managing BRK’s day-to-day operations. As a collection of hundreds of companies that often have absolutely nothing in common with each other, BRK is already highly decentralized. Buffett’s main contribution has been capital allocation.

Giving up the CEO title while he’s still alive means Buffett has brought in his replacement in an orderly way and created a smooth transition. But I have a feeling that on January 1, 2026, when Greg Abel officially becomes CEO, nothing will really change, and Warren will continue doing what he’s been doing for as long as he can. If Buffett is able – he’ll be 95 – he’ll still drive to the office and stop by McDonald’s for a breakfast sandwich (there’s a lot of wisdom in finding pleasure in little things). His son Howard Buffett will become chairman after Warren, with his only job being to preserve the culture.

I’ve been asked what I think of BRK stock. We bought the stock during the pandemic. It has done better than I expected, in part because of the strong performance of Apple, which was BRK’s largest holding. But BRK today is an unexciting investment at its current price. In all honesty, it is a conglomerate with some good and some merely okay businesses.

As a consumer, I get a (small) glimpse into how BRK businesses are being run by visiting Dairy Queen. BRK owns DQ, and I love their soft-serve ice cream (though I only eat it when I travel). My favorite part of research!

DQ has (or maybe had) a strong brand and operates on a capital-light model as a franchisor. But most stores I have visited looked like they have been neglected and need fresh paint. To be sure, I understand the limitations of this “analysis,” and DQ overall amounts to a rounding error on BRK’s financials. But little things often reveal much about big things.

BRK’s big businesses, from what I can glean through their financials, are not particularly well managed – GEICO and BNSF (railroad) have definitely been undermanaged lately. BNSF is not nearly as efficient as its competitors that embraced precision railroading, and until recently GEICO was losing market share to Progressive. 

BRK’s reinsurance business, a significant source of BRK’s profitability, is run by the extraordinary Ajit Jain. Ajit is in his 70s and unfortunately it seems he is not in great health. Is his replacement going to shoot the lights out, like he did? We don’t know. But Ajit is probably more important to BRK today than Buffett.

BRK is not going to melt into oblivion after Buffett is gone, but its best days are behind it. As Buffett has acknowledged, just its size alone makes it very difficult for BRK to grow. Truth be told, even if Buffett were thirty years younger and continued to run BRK, I am not sure the results would be much different than what I think the future holds with Abel at the helm. 

Buffett and Charlie Munger had a tremendous impact on me as an investor and human being. I am incredibly thankful to both. 

I hope Warren is there next year, but, in either case, I will be. As value investors say, “next year in Omaha”.

Reason why I don't really attend that even this year I feel I didn't really get anything useful out from WB talks.

I think man talk mostly b-shit if we think this was a shareholder meeting. He didn't talk about BH prospects, possible future plans, market valuation or anything like that.

His talk was really boring to be honest.  ""People should work like in WW2""  Yea? That is utterly unrealistic. People just don't start doing like that in peacetime.

2025-05-06 03:49:07,r/BerkshireHathaway,Riding the Market Rollercoaster:,"# The Power of Patience in Volatile Markets

In volatile markets, which can be like a roller coaster, the only real way to get hurt is to jump off. As long as you remain in your seat and keep your arms inside the vehicle, you can ride out even the most tumultuous market conditions. This timeless wisdom holds true through every market cycle—but comes with an important caveat.

# The Foundation: A Quality Portfolio

This strategy only works if you have a diversified portfolio of quality businesses that you can dependably rely on to make it to the finish line. If your portfolio is full of risky, highly leveraged businesses or lacks proper diversification, it can be the equivalent of having the roller coaster rail ripped from the track halfway through the ride. In such precarious situations, jumping off might seem like your best option.

Even then, caution is warranted. Things are rarely as bad as they initially appear during market turmoil. The more prudent approach is building a properly diversified portfolio—either through index funds or a carefully selected group of 10 to 20 quality businesses with diverse underlying fundamentals—that is designed to carry you safely to your financial destination.

# April's Market Volatility: A Case Study

Recent market behavior provides a perfect illustration of this principle. In April, we witnessed extreme volatility with the market dropping 15% from the beginning to the middle of the month, only to recover and finish down less than 1%. This remarkable turbulence included the market losing over 10% in just two days before regaining it in one.

Investors who panicked and sold during this downturn effectively jumped off the roller coaster midway through the ride—a guaranteed way to sustain financial injury. Those who remained seated emerged relatively unscathed despite the wild ride.

# The Peril of Portfolio Hopping

Over the long term, whether at the portfolio or individual equity level, jumping from position to position is typically unwise. Abandoning one roller coaster for another in hopes of avoiding discomfort often leads to peril. This doesn't mean adjustments are never warranted, but they should be infrequent and made only when there's high probability of serious structural problems ahead—not simply because the track momentarily disappears from view.

# The Asymmetric Mathematics of Returns

The mathematics of investment returns creates an asymmetric relationship between losses and the gains needed to recover them. This reality makes market timing even more dangerous than it initially appears.

Consider what happened to investors who abandoned the market this April:

* Best case scenario: They bought back at the very bottom and realized a 10-15% gain.
* Worst case scenario: They sold at the bottom, locking in a 10-15% loss.

The problem is that recovering from losses requires disproportionately larger gains. If you've lost 15% of your capital, you don't need a 15% gain to break even—you need approximately 17.6%. This mathematical reality means that the ultimate measure of a portfolio is how it performs during downturns, as recovering afterward is mathematically far more challenging than simply foregoing some upside.

# The Bottom Line

Market volatility is inevitable. Building a portfolio of quality investments and having the discipline to stay the course through turbulence are the keys to long-term investing success. Remember: on the market roller coaster, the injuries come not from the ride itself, but from jumping off before reaching your destination.

2025-05-05 22:00:57,r/BerkshireHathaway,Taking the Measure of Warren Buffett,"&gt;[By Roger Lowenstein](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/opinion/taking-the-measure-of-warren-buffett.html)

&gt;Mr. Lowenstein is the author of ”Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist.”

&gt;After six decades of pearly wisdom and investment gems, the news from Omaha hit like a thunderbolt.

&gt;As a fellow shareholder emailed me after Warren Buffett announced on Saturday that he would retire at the end of the year as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, “Even though we knew it was inevitable, Warren’s announcement today came as a shock to the system.”

&gt;In an age of insecurity, Mr. Buffett was an anchor of endurance. Since he took the helm of Berkshire — on May 10, 1965 — General Motors, then the largest American corporation, has greeted 11 new chief executives. Sears, Roebuck, the biggest retailer, has vanished from the scene. Eleven U.S. presidents have come and gone (two of them having survived impeachment and one forced to resign), and Coca-Cola changed its formula, but Mr. Buffett didn’t change his.

&gt;And it wasn’t just constancy. Berkshire’s stock that day in May closed at $18 a share. When he delivered the news, it was above $809,000 — almost 45,000 times as high. Over the same span, the Dow Jones industrial average is up just under 45 times.

&gt;For the uninitiated, that means his performance was, literally, a thousand times that of the blue-chip American index. Mr. Buffett was the best investor ever — no second choices. But as I wrote 30 years ago in a biography of him, “The numbers alone do not account for the aura.” Since his performance reflects his many decades of managing Berkshire’s investments, he is also among the greatest corporate leaders.

&gt;It was not just the math (Elon Musk is richer) but also the quality of his performance. To paraphrase the famous testimony of J.P. Morgan Sr., with whom Mr. Buffett is often compared, it was his character.

&gt; Berkshire Hathaway shares are under pressure Monday as investors process Warren Buffett’s surprise announcement to step down and envision a new path for the conglomerate after his legendary 60-year run. Buffett, 94, picked the very last moment at Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, to tell his loyal shareholders that it’s time for Greg Abel, vice chairman of non-insurance operations, to replace him as CEO. The board voted unanimously on Sunday to make Abel president and CEO on Jan. 1, 2026, and for Buffett to remain as chairman.

&gt; “Shareholders should welcome this transparent transition, but also have confidence that Warren isn’t going anywhere,” said Macrae Sykes, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds and a Berkshire shareholder. “Retaining the position of Chairman means he can continue to mentor Greg and the Berkshire leaders, while also providing additional intellectual capacity when the inevitable time for more major capital allocation occurs.”

&gt; It marks an end of an epic era for Berkshire, which was a failing New England textile mill six decades ago when Buffett used an investment partnership he ran to take control. Berkshire has grown into a one-of-a-kind juggernaut worth nearly $1.2 trillion with businesses encompassing insurance, railroad, retail, manufacturing and energy. Buffett is handing over his reins on a particularly high note as Berkshire shares just reached a new peak Friday. “Buffett leaves a company that is less reliant on his investing capabilities, with an array of leading businesses with strong cash flows,” Brian Meredith, UBS’ Berkshire analyst, said in a note. “Operationally, we expect little change at BRK and the culture/strategy to remain unchanged under Abel.”",1051,189,WickedSensitiveCrew,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kfdfjv/berkshire_hathaway_shares_fall_after_shocking/,1kfdfjv

2025-05-04 20:05:26,r/BerkshireHathaway,Berkshire's Cash Pile,"So i'm curious about something and i was wondering if any long-term investors here might know the answer.

Berkshire today has over $300B invested in Treasury Bills with a maturity of less than 1yr.

The financial media loves to make noise over this and often times it's used as some kind of proof or evidence that Buffett is bearish on the market/expecting a crash despite him never actually saying such things.

So my question is, why short-term T-Bills and why not longer-term Bonds?

If Buffett finds the 3-12 month yield of 4-4.3% attractive, why not invest in the 30yr bond with a yield of 4.8%?

Additionally, the 30yr bond has the potential upside of the nominal value significantly appreciating if/when the Fed lowers rates.

If the fed cuts rates another 1.5-2% over the next five years, and you've locked in 4.8% on 30yrs with another 25yrs to go - you could flip the bonds for quite alot more than you bought them for.

Obviously there's a risk that inflation goes higher and the Fed raises rates, but the odds of that happening seem extremely unlikely to me.

The risk/reward seems extremely favorable and in the worst case you just end up holding your bonds for a little longer while you collect 4.8% every year.

So i'm curious if this question, or something similar, has ever been asked and if Buffet has ever explained the reason they hold cash in bills instead of bonds?

Is there a reason he may not be able to invest that much in bonds? Maybe a regulatory reason? Or maybe just supply/demand issues?",20,12,WenMunSun,https://www.reddit.com/r/BerkshireHathaway/comments/1keq74v/berkshires_cash_pile/,1keq74v

Greg Able :-

Net worth - $480m

Berkshire Holding - $105m

Percent of BRK in his personal portfolio - approx 22%

Numbers may be a little off, but I assume broadly right, let's say give or take 10%.

So, the new CEO has less invested percentage wise than at times I have.  From a shareholder perspective I find this less than ideal, and given Buffett could have picked from hundreds of thousands of people, could he not have picked someone who loved the company as much as many of its shareholders?

I can’t help but feel saddened by it regardless of living such a successful and fulfilling life as he has. 

I bought BRK.B awhile back (not enough I might add) and I was asked why. Should have known better. Warren knows. Always has.

I’m a financial advisor and content creator based in Mexico, where I run a finance-focused channel with over 2 million followers across social media. I make videos about investing, the stock market, and financial literacy — all with a fun, accessible twist.

This year, I’m flying all the way to **Omaha** for the **Berkshire Annual Meeting**, and I’d love to film some **finance &amp; corporate trivia** with attendees — super casual and fun (with cash prizes). Also looking to do some **interviews** with investors or finance professionals who want to share their insights, experience or stories about the sector.

If you're going to be there and would be open to chatting, playing, or being interviewed (or if you just want to meet up and talk investing), feel free to **DM me or reply here**. I'd love to connect!

P.S. I’ll be sharing some of the interviews and trivia clips (with permission, of course) on my platforms to help more people get inspired to invest!

2025-04-26 04:35:07,r/BerkshireHathaway,"According to the Financial Times, Todd and Ted's combined portfolio has generated an annual return of about 7.8% over the past decade, trailing both Buffett's performance and the SP500 over the same period","Source: [https://www.ft.com/content/fd3b3324-d775-4e09-a916-76f2f3ac675b](https://www.ft.com/content/fd3b3324-d775-4e09-a916-76f2f3ac675b)

Overall, according to the FT analysis, which used Morningstar data, the pair have generated an average total annual return of about 7.8 per cent over the past decade. That falls short of the 12 per cent return of the S&amp;P 500 and Buffett’s own 10.2 per cent gain. They have trailed the index in seven out of 10 years.

However, they also exposed Buffet to Apple and Visa, which have significantly contributed to BRK's performance in the last decade.

\----

Note: the above article is from May 2024; BRK has since outperformed SP500, so trailing 10-year CAGR of BRK is around 14%, while SP500 is at 12%. Not sure how Todd/Ted's portfolio has performed in the last year.

Todd and Ted also have the advantage of only running around 1/10th of the capital of Buffett, so they should have a wider investable universe , as well.

I hope this gets addressed at the upcoming annual meeting. The question I submitted to ""[BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com](mailto:BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com)"": It has now been over a decade since ​Todd Combs and Ted Weschler joined Berkshire. We know that they are managing a portion of the overall portfolio. However, we do not know how well their holdings have performed, as this is not declared in the annual report. As both of them could potentially manage a greater portion of capital in the future, it is important for shareholders to understand how they've performed in the past and Warren's assessment of their investing record at Berkshire. Thank you!

# Key Takeaways

* Netflix shares jumped Tuesday after a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.
* The streaming giant aims to double its revenue by 2030 and reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday.
* Netflix is set to report first-quarter results after the market closes Thursday.

Netflix (NLFX) shares jumped Tuesday following a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.

Executives said the streaming giant aims to double the $39 billion in revenue Netflix brought in last year, with a global ad sales target of $9 billion by 2030, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The streaming giant also aims to reach a [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) of $1 trillion by 2030, the report said, up from roughly $419.2 billion. The only U.S. companies with a market cap above $1 trillion today include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B).

Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shares were up more than 5% in recent trading Tuesday, leading gains on the S&amp;P 500. They've added about 60% of their value over the past 12 months. (Read *Investopedia's* live coverage of [today's market action here](https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-04152025-11715325).)

Last week, Morgan Stanley analysts named Netflix a [“top pick,”](https://www.investopedia.com/netflix-a-top-pick-for-morgan-stanley-on-expected-resilience-to-a-weaker-market-11712037) arguing the company could be well-positioned to withstand the current tariff landscape. The streaming giant has shown ""momentum” in its core subscription business, the analysts said. That momentum lowers the company’s overall risk, the bank added, even if the advertising market struggles amid rising trade tensions.

Netflix is [set to report its first-quarter results](https://www.investopedia.com/what-analysts-think-of-netflix-stock-ahead-of-earnings-q1-fy2025-11712295) after the market closes Thursday.",523,94,callsonreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jzvy6f/netflix_stock_pops_after_report_streaming_giant/,1jzvy6f

2025-04-08 04:15:14,r/BerkshireHathaway,Maintaining Sanity When Someone Screams Fire! What to learn from Charli and Warren,"**Maintaining Sanity in Market Madness: The Art of Clear Thinking When Others Panic**

By: Grover Grafton

In the unpredictable world of financial markets, perhaps the most valuable asset isn't found in any portfolio but resides within ourselves: a clear, disciplined mind. When markets become volatile and participants succumb to collective panic, the ability to maintain rational thought becomes not just advantageous but essential. As the saying goes, ""The mind is the ultimate measure of the man,"" and surrendering one's rational thinking, even momentarily, can lead to devastating financial consequences. While there is no perfect solution to the psychological challenges of investing, there are practical approaches that can serve as anchors during turbulent times.

* The Foundation: Know What You Own

The first principle of maintaining mental clarity in chaotic markets is surprisingly simple yet frequently overlooked: know precisely what you own and why you own it. More importantly, write it down. This documentation process serves multiple purposes. It forces clarity of thought at the time of purchase, creating a record uncontaminated by future market movements or emotional states. When markets plunge and fear takes hold, these written records become invaluable reference points, reminding us of the rational analysis that led to our decisions.

This documentation need not be complex—a simple statement of the business fundamentals, competitive advantages, and your thesis for ownership suffices. The act of writing crystallizes thought and creates a touchstone to return to when markets test your resolve. Without this anchor, investors often find themselves adrift in a sea of market opinions, unable to distinguish between sound reasoning and fear-driven reactions

* The Microscope Over the Telescope: Focus on Business, Not Economics

The second principle challenges conventional wisdom: forget macro economics. While economic forecasts make for interesting reading and discussion, they rarely translate into actionable investment insights. Instead, keep your attention fixed on the businesses you own and only on them. This narrow focus is not ignorance but discipline.

Great companies navigate through various economic cycles, often emerging stronger from downturns as weaker competitors falter. By concentrating on company-specific metrics—cash flow, competitive positioning, management quality, and growth prospects—investors insulate themselves from the noise of economic predictions that often prove wrong. The question isn't whether GDP will grow by 2% or 3%, but whether your businesses' competitive advantages remain intact and their long-term prospects sound.

* The Golden Rule: Time as the Ultimate Multiplier

Perhaps the most powerful principle is the recognition that ""Money is made in owning great businesses for long periods."" This golden rule stands in stark contrast to the frenetic trading that often characterizes market behavior during volatile periods. The compounding effect of high returns on capital over decades creates wealth that short-term trading simply cannot match.

This perspective transforms how we view market downturns. Rather than threats, they become opportunities to acquire more ownership in excellent businesses at favorable prices. The investor who understands this principle sees volatility not as something to fear but as the very mechanism that creates opportunity. Without the occasional panic, premium businesses would rarely become available at reasonable prices.

* The Psychology of Serenity: Avoiding Imagined Troubles

The fourth principle addresses the psychological dimension of investing: don't suffer imagined troubles. Mark Twain famously said, ""I've had a lot of worries in my life, most of which never happened."" In investing, this wisdom is particularly relevant. Markets constantly present potential catastrophes to worry about, most of which never materialize or prove far less severe than feared.

The discipline of distinguishing between actual business problems and theoretical market concerns is crucial. Has something fundamentally changed in your business, or are prices simply reflecting temporary uncertainty? This distinction helps prevent the costly mistake of selling quality assets during market panics, only to repurchase them at higher prices when confidence returns.

* The Balanced Life: Investment as a Component, Not the Whole

The final principle extends beyond investing itself: get another hobby and don't forget to live life. Investing should be an important but not all-consuming activity. Those who allow market movements to dominate their thoughts and emotions inevitably make poorer decisions. The investor who maintains outside interests and perspective can step back from market turbulence with greater ease. Gardening is my balast and its a hobby I'd reccomend!

This balance serves a practical purpose beyond just quality of life. Distance from the daily noise of markets often leads to clearer thinking about long-term value. Many of history's most successful investors are known not for their frenetic activity but for their patience and ability to ignore short-term market movements in favor of long-term business outcomes.

# The Integrated Approach

These five principles work together as a system rather than isolated tactics. The investor who knows what they own and why, focuses on business fundamentals rather than economic predictions, understands the power of long-term ownership, avoids imagined troubles, and maintains life balance possesses a formidable psychological advantage.

In practice, this approach might mean reviewing your written investment theses during market declines rather than market commentary. It might mean turning off financial news during volatile periods to focus instead on the quarterly reports of businesses you own. It certainly means resisting the urge to make major portfolio changes based on short-term market movements or economic predictions.

# Conclusion

In the final analysis, the investor who maintains their composure when others lose theirs not only preserves capital but positions themselves to capitalize on the opportunities that market dislocations invariably create. Perhaps that is the ultimate advantage: the ability to act rationally when rationality is in shortest supply.",18,1,Silent_Mistake758,https://www.reddit.com/r/BerkshireHathaway/comments/1ju2ue4/maintaining_sanity_when_someone_screams_fire_what/,1ju2ue4

Warren Buffett‘s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK)
has outperformed the losses in the S&amp;P 500, while the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ has emerged as the only top 10 billionaire to see a net worth gain on a year-to-date basis in 2025.

Shares of Berkshire Hathaway’s class B shares have risen by 9.41% in 2025, being one of the only few S&amp;P 500 components that are still in the green amid the ongoing market selloff. The S&amp;P 500 index, on the other hand, has fallen 13.54% on a year-to-date basis.

While there has been a flurry of speculations over the company’s cash pile, having the liquid form of dollars has helped the company avert losses amid President Donald Trump‘s tariff-fueled crash on Wall Street.

Berkshire Hathaway’s cash and cash equivalents totaled a record $334.2 billion as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2024.

The firm has also added $87.81 billion in investor wealth in 2025 as its market capitalization has risen from $978.19 billion as of Dec. 31, 2024, to $1,066 billion as of Friday, April 4.

Buffett is also among the only one of the top 10 billionaires, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index, to witness a net worth gain of $12.7 billion in 2025.",503,30,SPXQuantAlgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jtkmwq/berkshire_hathaway_shrugs_off_trump_tariff/,1jtkmwq

2025-03-17 19:06:07,r/BerkshireHathaway,Charlie Mungers Best Mental Models (16 in Total):,"[https://www.valuejournals.com/post/mental-models-sensational-16](https://www.valuejournals.com/post/mental-models-sensational-16)

**""The best way to get what you want is to try to deserve it.""**

Focus on becoming worthy of your aspirations rather than trying to game or shortcut your way to them. Build the skills, character, and capabilities that naturally lead to what you desire.

This is the golden Rule.

**""The time it takes to build something is its half life.""**

The effort and time invested in creating something often mirrors how long it will remain relevant or valuable. Great works that take years to build often last decades, while quick projects may have similarly brief utility. Remeber, great thing are built brick by brick, board by board. Rome wasn't built in a night.

**""You should only expect to make money in things you understand.""**

Stay within your circle of competence. Investment success comes from deep knowledge of what you're investing in, not from chasing trends or opportunities you can't fully grasp. It's easy to look good and make money in good times but your outperformance is proportional to your degree of preparedness for the bad times.

**""When hiring, look for integrity, energy, and smarts.""**

These three qualities are fundamental and irreplaceable. You can teach skills, but you cannot instill basic honesty, drive, or intelligence. Without integrity you might as well forget the last two. If someone doesn't have it you want them dumb and lazy.

**""Something that isn't fair, in the end, can never be good.""**

Sustainable success requires ethical foundations. Unfair practices or arrangements will eventually collapse or corrupt, regardless of short-term benefits.

**""In life and business, look for win-wins.""**

The best relationships and deals benefit all parties. Zero-sum thinking is limiting; look for ways to expand the pie rather than just dividing it.  Don't take pride in getting the better of a counter party; thinking ha-ha, I showed them. Take pride when you've constructed a good deal for everyone. A Win-Win.

2025-03-17 18:59:28,r/BerkshireHathaway,Buffets views on Risk Vs. Uncertaity,"**Great Article:**

[https://www.valuejournals.com/post/uncertainty-risk](https://www.valuejournals.com/post/uncertainty-risk)

**Chunk of The Article**

In equity investing, there isn't a more costly mistake than confusing uncertainty with risk. This is a mistake no one can afford; So, lets break it down. But first a few definitions (As I see them).

**Risk** **= The probability of any Permanent loss of capital.**

**Uncertainty** **= The dispersion of potential future outcomes.**

When these two get confused, as is easily done, things often get thrown out that, when viewed properly, offer great opportunities.

To properly evaluate any asset you must deliniate these characteristics in you mind and gauge them separatley.

# Here are the steps in my thought process:

Ask yourself, ""What's the worst and best situation that might occur?"" This measures the breadth of uncertainty. The bigger the gap between the best and worst-case scenario, the more uncertainty. If you find yourself unable to predict the best and worst scenarios, throw it in the ""Too Hard Pile"".Most securities spend the majority of their time in the ""Range of Reasonableness"" where, given the best and worst situation, they trade at a price that will deliver an average market return. This is, however, decreasingly true the more uncertainty there is (the bigger the aforementioned gap).

Given you're reading this to gain an edge and stocks with average uncertainty yield an average return, we want to be looking for highly uncertain low-risk situations. Where there is an easily determined but massive gap between the best and worst scenarios and the market has discounted the asset to an unreasonably low valuation (in relation to the worst-case scenario) due to its irrational confusion between risk and uncertainty.

Given all this, above-average returns are found when a stream of cash flows from a equity shares (company) or other assets are highly uncertain (as defined above) but can be purchased at a price that results in a low probability of permanent capital loss.

This gap between probable worst scenarios value for a security and the price at which a security is purchased is your margin of safety, dictating your return and whether a bet is low risk.



**High Uncertainty / Low Risk is ""Where the Fi$h Are"".**  ",15,3,Silent_Mistake758,https://www.reddit.com/r/BerkshireHathaway/comments/1jdj57k/buffets_views_on_risk_vs_uncertaity/,1jdj57k

I'm curious how the ""in Per-Share Market Value of Berkshire and in S&amp;P 500 with Dividends Included"" numbers were determined.

I don't know what he meant by this

&gt;""In summary, if you've invested at some point in the last 16 years, it's probably the case that you've lost out relatively. I think it's unlikely that Berkshire will catch up with the S&amp;P500 from 16 years ago.""

I guess if you look just at the last 16 years (1/01/2009 to 12/31/24) the S&amp;P500 has had more total return, 789% vs 605%. Last 16 years from 3/14/09 to 3/14/25, S&amp;P 901% to BRK A 823%. But Berkshire seems to be doing very well in the last [14 years.](https://imgur.com/a/YKVoWZe) So it seems like if youve invested after those 16 years.. youd be doing well

This the comparison of Berkshire-A to the S&amp;P 500 in the shorter and longer term. I picked SPLG as a fund that tracks the S&amp;P 500.

* I see [CAGR ](https://imgur.com/a/vFo87jW)
   * SPLG  10Y 12.37%, **15Y 13.24%**, 20Y 10.2%

Mike played a big roll in Berkshire's early/middle period, working for years in the office next to Buffett's. He filled multiple rolls there over the years.

I have invested for a few years now with Edward Jones, but only recently have I been trying on my own. I've have taken a few finance classes (nothing too advanced) and I've been trying to learn how to read candlestick graphs, using trading view etc. 

As an unemployed freelancer, I've moved a lot of my cash into brk.b. Not so much that I would be bankrupt if it dropped, but anything that I had planned to use for fun for the next few months.

I took a few hundred dollars this week and used it to buy puts in tesla stock, which netted me a little over a thousand. I took that thousand and just added it to brk.b. 

I figure I won't always be right. I might never be right again, so I'm not going to trade every week. But keeping my future earning in brk.b seems pretty reliable. I initially bought in at 478 and now have an average price of 499. I think every time it dips between 485-500 I'll buy more.

2025-02-23 17:18:08,r/BerkshireHathaway,Berkshire Hathaway deep dive and intrinsic value estimate by Chris Bloomstran of Semper Augustus,"Chris Bloomstran is considered an expert on Berkshire Hathaway. He runs a fund called Semper Augustus and every year, he writes a massive 100+ page letter to his fundholders and the public. In it, there is a large section where he does an annual deep dive into Berkshire and gives an estimate on the intrinsic value of the company. You won't find a more comprehensive Berkshire analysis that is up to date anywhere. It starts on page 97 and goes to page 163 and is a bit of a slog, but if you have never read one of his letters, it is worth a read. This letter was released Friday night, so he did not have access to the annual report. Bloomstran tends to give a high valuation compared to other analysis to Berkshire, so take that how you see fit.

2025-02-22 15:44:19,r/BerkshireHathaway,Early thoughts on Berkshire's Annual Report,"1. Cash holdings increased to $322 billion, up from $168 billion last year.
2. Float now stands at $171 billion, though its growth has slowed. Buffett notes that while no other insurer is as willing to take on risk as Berkshire, the company will contract if pricing becomes inadequate.
3. P/C had a strong year, with GEICO performing exceptionally well. In 2024 alone, Berkshire generated $9 billion in P/C underwriting income—26% of the total from the past 22 years. Notably, 42% of that total has come in just the last two years.
4. Japanese yen investment/borrowing strategy continues. Berkshire increased its yen-denominated borrowing by 40%, from $9 billion in 2023 to $12.6 billion in 2024. Since its initial investments in Japanese equities, asset values have grown by 30%. Meanwhile, net interest on the yen debt has been approximately $135 million, compared to the $812 million in dividends earned from Japanese equities.
5. Hurricane Helene and Milton losses totaled $1.2 billion in 2024.

2025-02-20 15:33:17,r/BerkshireHathaway,"30-Year Market close, you have to pick three companies to own. What's your picks?","

**What companies will do well for ever?**

The world 30 years ago was quite different from today, and change is probably just speeding up. Lets also add that you cant two very very similar companies, like Cola and Pepsi; or multiple railroads.

My picks:

1. **Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A/B):** Diversified beast: Railroads (BNSF), Utilities, manufacturing, plus blue-chip holdings like Coca-Cola and Amex. They also have the fattest pocketbook in the world and can enter what business they damn please---for example like they did with apple a few years ago. Built to endure.
2. **Amazon (AMZN):** Unrivalled logistics and cloud infrastructure (AWS) create a nearly insurmountable moat; their scale and efficiency in delivering both physical goods and digital services are unmatched. They are sort of the digital backbone of America, for both retail and essential cloud infrastructure. Competitors can't replicate this position overnight, if ever. It's funny though, 30 years ago Amazon was something like 200 days old.
3. Struggling with this one. Torn between:
   * **Waste Management (WM):** Garbage will always be a problem.
   * **The New York Times (NYT):** This newspaper probably never goes away.
   * **Madison Square Garden Entertainment (MSGE) (Knicks+Rangers):** I think sports are for ever, and i think NYC is for ever; Knicks and Rangers are great brands with deep history.
   * **Universal Music Group (UMG):** Music is for ever, and these guys are in a very good position with their music rights.
   * **JPMorgan Chase (JPM):** Banking giant. Financial system backbone, hard to see it go away. The largest banks have changed over time though. There are temptations to be stupid in banking and that can have big consequences. Citi used to be king; Lehman actually went bust. Still i think JPM is for ever.
   * **Moody's (MCO):** Ratings agencies = near-monopoly in a for ever necessary service. Hard to see this change imo.

i think my third pick might actually be **MSGE**...

I’ve been investing in Canada for the past five years and exclusively use Wealthsimple as my platform. Honestly, I think it’s the best option for Canadians who don’t have USD accounts.

I was able to pay off my student loan through investing, as I started in my first year of my MBA. After clearing my loan in 2023, I resumed investing, and here’s my current portfolio (listed alphabetically) along with the percentage allocation and gains/losses since purchase:



Portfolio Overview:

	•	AMZN – 6% (+24%)

	•	BAM – 1% (+29%)

	•	BRK.B – 4% (+20%)

	•	CNQ – 3% (-2%)

	•	CP – 2% (-5%)

	•	ENB – 3% (+21%)

	•	FBTC – 2.5% (-9%) Bought a month ago to gain exposure to crypto

	•	FTS – 1% (+15%)

	•	GOOGL – 4% (+25%)

	•	META – 6% (+128%)

	•	MFC – 1% (+65%)

	•	MSFT – 6.5% (+1%)

	•	NA – 4% (+8%)

	•	POW – 7% (+22%)

	•	RY – 3% (+22%)

	•	SES – 5% (+68%)

	•	SHOP – 5% (+74%)

	•	SU – 0.3% (+2%)

	•	TD – 5% (+2%)

	•	TDUP – 0.1% (-87%) Old mistake—been holding for five years, hoping for a turnaround LOL

	•	TECK.A – 0.7% (-12%)

	•	TSLA – 4% (-1%)

	•	VDY – 1% (+0.5%)

	•	VEQT – 4% (+4%)

	•	VFV – 8% (+14%)

	•	VTI – 3% (+35%)

	•	WMT – 4% (+54%)

	•	XGRO – 3.5% (+1%)

	•	ZCN – 1% (+10%)



Questions:

	1.	I currently hold 29 stocks, which seems excessive. Are there any that you’d recommend as an immediate SELL?

	2.	Lately, I’ve been increasing my ETF allocation while reducing exposure to volatile stocks. Does this seem like a solid strategy, or should I continue investing in blue-chip tech stocks to maintain strong returns?

	3.	Any other feedback or recommendations?

As I’m approaching retirement (~4 yrs or so depending), i want to set up a glidepath and  increase our fixed income allocation slowly over the next few yrs to reduce SRR. 

We re currently at 95% equity &amp; rest in HYSA &amp; fixed income.   

If I consider that 30% of BRK market cap is in cash &amp; treasuries, our asset allocation is closer to 90 equity &amp; 10%  and we’re halfway there to an allocation goal of 85/15.  

Context: BRK.B is our single largest individual stock and I don’t plan to sell any anytime soon.   It is 15% of our overall portfolio and over 50% of our taxable account since it doesn’t pay dividends unlike VOO &amp; VXF which constitute the rest.  It is tax efficient and we get to decide when to realize gains 😀. 

I understand that BRK could one day decide to deploy some of it. Hopefully it will be used just to buy back stocks whenever it dips.

For the third year in a row, Brooks maintained its status as the No. 1 adult performance running footwear brand in U.S. national retail.

In doing so I have noticed the difficulty in valuing bank stocks. I like companies with long-term growth and a sound financial base, but I could not find such bank stocks using the valuation methods I know. At least, ROE, ROA, etc. are completely useless. I would like to know if any of you guys know of a good screening method when looking for bank stocks.

Incidentally, the screening setup I am currently using, which I barely discovered through trial and error, is that the company has a market capitalization of at least $5 billion, has not reduced its dividend in the past 10 years, and has a positive total asset growth rate and net profit margin. This is a good assessment of profitability and growth, but not of financial health.

Also, I already have positions in XLF, JPM and BRK. Several of my friends have recommended that I invest in other quality financial stocks (like MSCI, NASDAQ, S&amp;P) that are not bank stocks because of the current real estate market conditions, etc. I would like to know about counterproposed stocks if you have the same opinion as my friend!",30,17,vistron6295,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i6e1ip/how_to_discover_the_best_bank_stocks/,1i6e1ip

What do you think? I'm sure here are a lot of people who own the stock and know a lot of thinks about the company. At this moment I have BRK-b only 7-8% of my portfolio.

They talk about 1.45 times price to book value being on the high end etc.  But, if you think about it, the book value of assets never changes in the books.  If they bought BNSF 15 years ago for X, thats still the book value.  Plus all the buybacks actually reduce book value.   Therefore, in my opinion the price/book should theoretically go up over time.  Not to mention the fact that Buffett himself says it is no longer a relevant metric and excludes it from the annual report. Still, I continually see this as the primary measure of valuation.

2025-01-11 14:08:06,r/BerkshireHathaway,Battery Storage and Solar Expansion at the Heart of NV Energy’s Growth Plan,"NV Energy, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, has received approval from the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada (PUCN) for its comprehensive plan to meet the state’s growing energy demands and support economic development. The decision ensures the delivery of reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy while aligning with Nevada’s renewable energy goals.

“With Nevada’s growth comes the need for expanded infrastructure,” said NV Energy President and CEO Doug Cannon. “This balanced plan supports economic growth, job creation, and energy reliability, all while keeping costs significantly below the national average and over 50% lower than California’s energy rates.”

Key elements of the approved plan include the addition of over 1,000 megawatts of solar power and 1,000 megawatts of battery storage. It also includes approximately 400 megawatts of natural-gas peaking units to handle high summer energy demand, reducing reliance on costly and unreliable market purchases. These natural-gas units are designed to integrate hydrogen as a fuel source in the future.

Also, I don’t know much about the insurance industry, so I’d love to hear from someone more knowledgeable about why SiriusXM or insurance companies, in general, could be good or bad investments at this point of time.

What do you think? Are these worth considering, or is it better to look elsewhere—maybe for smaller companies with higher potential returns?

Anyways, I recently heard of TQQQ, A lower price, 3x more volatile version of QQQ. My initial thought was that it's a better trade than the regular one. The graph I shared depicts something similar, where one function is more expensive, yet both have the same volatility in dollars. Its not a good graph, as it doesn't show any changes except a wave, but hopefully it's enough. Wouldn't it make more sense to invest in the red one, as you pay less for the same rate of return? Just assume that the two functions are perfectly correlated, just one has a higher magnitude. My second question is why are TQQQ and QQQ not perfectly correlated? I understand for something like BRK.A and BRK.B which are almost perfectly correlated, but TQQQ and QQQ don't really have a similar graph, as TQQQ has just barely surpassed its previous high in winter 2021, compared to QQQ which has increased by 33% in the same time period. Again, sorry if this is not coherent or lacking clarity. Thanks!

2024-11-22 14:40:58,r/stocks,Thoughts on building a 10Y high risk portfolio,"Over the past few years I’ve built a portfolio consisting of S&amp;P, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, JPM and BRK. It has done rather well, consistently giving returns of 25%+ annually (except 2022). 

However in recent times my conviction on adding more capital to this portfolio has waned. I just feel the best days in terms of returns for some of the big tech groups may not be what they were for the past decade.

I could 100% be wrong and there is no doubt there is certain bias seeing the return of my smaller positions this year dwarfing the ones of the traditional blue chip guys if you will.

So saying all this I’m considering: 

50% S&amp;P

10% Hood

10% Rddt

10% Rolls Royce

10% Cava

5% Lunr

5% ASTS

Quick rationale for each:

Hood: Expanding to Europe and offering very exciting new products like Hood Gold 

Rddt: Fastest growing social media, ARPU and monetisation only getting better and seeing many more people using

Rolls Royce: Slight European exposure, building low cost Nuclear plants and capturing the wide body aircraft market

Cava: Fantastic management, strong customer retention and expected to double stores in next 5 years

Lunr &amp; ASTS: Moonshot (literally), this is just in case space works out and much more speculative 



So having said all that, what is everyone’s thoughts on this proposed portfolio allocation. Is this too risky, not enough diversification into the different sectors? Any thoughts and opinions on this would be great!",0,0,Ok_Criticism_558,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gx83cf/thoughts_on_building_a_10y_high_risk_portfolio/,1gx83cf

Earnings really grew 8.5% in Q3 to $11.2 billion against $10.3 billion and were up 18.0% for the nine months to $33.0 billion from $28.0 billion. Just as short-term movements in equity prices can distort the reporting of operating profits, so to do currency swings on debt outstanding.

Internationally, Brooks saw over 30% revenue growth in the Asia Pacific-Latin America region (APLA) and a 10% increase in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), driven by a 24% boost in e-commerce sales.

2024-10-18 16:59:12,r/stocks,I Flipped My Entire Portfolio of ETFs for AI Stocks,"Yesterday, I made a major shift in my stock portfolio. I used to rely on ETFs like SPY, QQQ, and SCHD, but now I’ve sold most of them and focused on NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, ISRG, AAPL, SCHG, and a bit of SOXX.

Here’s why: Right now, AI might feel limited to things like ChatGPT, but its potential goes far beyond that. Over the next 3, 5, or 10 years, AI is going to transform industries in ways we can’t fully imagine yet. We’re talking about healthcare revolutionizing how we diagnose and treat patients, transportation with autonomous vehicles and drones making logistics smarter and more efficient, and manufacturing, where AI will optimize production processes and supply chains.

Now, I know what you're thinking: 'What, you think the world is full of cave dwellers? Who doesn't know that?' and you're right. Everyone knows AI techonology will be advanced and utilized in so many ways in the near future.

But look, you can think of it like real estate. Sure, property values rise while new highways or shopping centers are being built, but the real surge in value happens once people start using them and see the full benefits. Right now, AI is still in its “under construction” phase—people can imagine the future potential, but the true value hasn’t been fully realized yet. The market has priced in expectations, sure, but once AI is fully integrated across industries and we start seeing its widespread, real-world impact, I believe we’ll see another major surge in stock prices. What’s priced in now is just the beginning—the real growth will come as AI starts transforming daily life and business on a much larger scale.

Before ChatGPT went mainstream, people assumed ‘just’ that level of AI technology would arrive soon enough, but they didn’t think it would have this much of an impact on stock prices once it came to life for the public. Everyone knew advanced AI was on the horizon, but the market didn’t price it like they do now. This shows just how much underestimation happens until we truly start experiencing the technology firsthand. And that’s why, despite what’s already been priced in, I think AI stocks are still undervalued given the game-changing growth ahead. Anyone else rethinking their portfolio with AI at the center?",0,0,Nobuevrday,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g6k31k/i_flipped_my_entire_portfolio_of_etfs_for_ai/,1g6k31k

2024-10-10 06:54:14,r/BerkshireHathaway,Berkshire Hathaway raises $1.9 billion in Samurai bonds,"[The News](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/berkshire-hathaway-raises-19-billion-samurai-bonds-term-sheet-shows-4669951)

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has raised **281.8 billion yen ($1.9 billion) in a seven-tranche yen-denominated bond deal**, its largest sale in the Japanese currency in five years, a term sheet reviewed by Reuters on Thursday showed.

The yen bond issue signals Buffett's deepening association with Japan's capital markets after its equity stake buys in the nation's top-5 trading houses over the past four years.

The U.S. investment company issued bonds with tenors of 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 28 and 30 years, according to the term sheet.

The 3-year tranche was the largest with 155.4 billion yen raised. The 5-year bond raised 58 billion yen.

Longer-dated bonds were added during the transaction and a proposed 15-year tranche was dropped, messages sent from the deal's bookrunners showed.

Final prices for each of the tranches were set at the lower to middle end of the revised price guidance given to investors, term sheets showed.

The deal was the largest yen-denominated bond issuance for Berkshire Hathaway since 2019 when it first issued yen, or Samurai, bonds

Berkshire Hathaway said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing that the proceeds raised in the deal would be used for general corporate purposes. It did not disclose the size of the deal in the filing.

The firm first announced it would buy stakes in Japan's trading houses in 2020 with the intention of holding them long-term and increasing ownership to as much as 9.9 per cent. Since then, it has raised its stake in Japan's top five trading firms to around 9 per cent each, according to its annual report dated Feb. 24.

It sold 263.3 billion yen of bonds in April.

""Berkshire's yen bond sales this year is the biggest in a year since it started selling yen bonds and this indicates their expectations for upside of Japanese stocks,” said Takehiko Masuzawa, trading head of Phillip Securities Japan.

""The market is looking at what kind of stocks will be their next target. Investors see value stocks which pay higher dividends, such as banks and insurers, will be the most likely targets.""

2024-10-01 21:15:40,r/stocks,Challenge to find stocks matching 13 attributes of Peter Lynch,"I tried to find modern examples to each attribute mentioned in Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street. Then I thought this community could find better fits and have fun together. So please share you candidates for any category below - maybe we discover hidden gems along the way.

RECAP: Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street is  filled with fundamental yet profound strategies.  Invest in simple, easy-to-understand businesses over complex ones.  Identify undervalued companies with stable returns and less competition. And, search for as many of 13 attributes of the hypothetically ""perfect company."" The dream attributes of such a company go as:

***It Sounds Dull—Or Even Better Ridiculous:***

Companies with unexciting or absurd names often go unnoticed and can be undervalued, providing excellent buying opportunities. Lynch highlights that these companies are typically engaged in simple, straightforward businesses and the duller the name, the better the prospects could be.

My examples: Duckhorn Portfolio (NAPA) &amp; The Lovesac Company (LOVE)

***It Does Something Dull:***

Companies engaged in mundane or straightforward businesses might not attract attention but often provide stable and increasing returns. Lynch appreciates companies that do boring things as they are less likely to be in the limelight and more likely to be undervalued.

My examples: Waste Management (WM) &amp; Stepan Company (SCL)

***It Does Something Disagreeable:***

Businesses involved in unpleasant industries (like waste management) are often overlooked. Their disagreeable nature keeps them under the radar of most investors, potentially leading to lower valuations and higher returns for those willing to invest in them.

My Examples: Altria Group (MO), cannabis companies and Caesars Entertainment (CZR)

***It’s a Spinoff:***

Corporate spinoffs often result in profitable investment opportunities. Parent companies usually ensure that spinoffs have strong balance sheets and are well-positioned for success, leading to lucrative investments.

Found a good website on this: [https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/](https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/)

***The Institutions Don’t Own It, and The Analysts Don’t Follow It:***

Stocks with little to no institutional ownership and minimal analyst coverage can indicate untapped potential. These ""ignored"" stocks might offer significant opportunities for gains before they become mainstream.

My examples: Denny's Corporation (DENN) &amp; Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR)

***The Rumors Abound: It’s Involved with Toxic Waste and/or the Mafia:***

Lynch points out that companies involved in industries surrounded by rumors or negative perceptions, like waste management or alleged Mafia connections, can offer hidden value. The negative stigma leads to fewer investors and potentially lower valuations.

My examples: **Clean Harbors (CLH)** &amp; Boyd Gaming (BYD)

***There’s Something Depressing About It:***

Companies operating in industries that deal with the less pleasant aspects of life, like funeral services, often have consistent demand and face little competition. They are typically ignored by the larger investing community, providing opportunities for higher returns.

My examples: Service Corporation International (SCI) &amp; Matthews International Corporation (MATW)

***It’s a No-Growth Industry:***

Contrary to popular belief, Lynch prefers investing in low or no-growth industries as they tend to have less competition and more predictable business. The stability and predictability of such industries can lead to steady returns.

My examples: Consolidated Edison (ED) &amp; American Water Works (AWK)

***It’s Got a Niche:***

A strong niche market provides a company with a competitive edge and often a virtual monopoly in its area. Niche companies can control pricing and enjoy high barriers to entry for competitors, often leading to sustained profits

My examples: Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) &amp; WD-40 Company (WDFC)

***People Have to Keep Buying It:***

Lynch prefers investing in companies that make essential, habitual or addictive products like drugs, soft drinks, or cigarettes over those making fickle products, as continuous buying ensures steady business.

My examples: Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) &amp; Reckitt Benckiser (RBGLY)

***It's a User of Technology:***

Companies that effectively utilize technology to reduce costs or enhance services are appealing. For example, a company benefiting from the technological price war, like Automatic Data Processing using cheaper computers to increase its profitability, is a better bet than the companies making the computers.

My examples: Walmart (WMT) &amp; Domino’s Pizza (DPZ)

***The Insiders are Buyers:***

Insider buying is a strong positive signal. If the people who know the company best are buying its stock, it's a good indication of confidence in the company's future. Lynch values insider buying as a sign that the company won't go bankrupt soon and that management is aligned with shareholders' interests.

My examples: Zoom Video Communications (ZM) &amp; Carnival Corporation (CCL)

***The Company is Buying Back Shares:***

Companies that buy back their own shares reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases the value of the remaining shares. This action typically indicates the company believes its shares are undervalued and is a way to reward investors. Lynch sees share buybacks as a very positive move, often more beneficial than other use of capital like dividends or acquisitions​.

2024-09-30 21:42:45,r/BerkshireHathaway,Should BRK buy BA?,"Crazy idea, right?  Boeing is losing money, its price-to-book has turned negative (yikes!), management’s in turmoil, myriad of production woes….BA is such a troubled company right now.  But its current market cap is under $95b — BRK could certainly pony up the cash to take control of this massive elephant.  

As one competitor in a de facto duopoly w a staggeringly high barrier to entry, Boeing can right the ship and eventually return to long term profitability.  It would be a risk, to be sure.  But there is enormous, unique opportunity in this iconic American company (and we all know that Uncle Warren says to never bet against America).  A BRK takeover would help relieve short-term pressure on BA, enabling management to focus on fixing the longer term challenges.  What’s more, just the news of a BRK takeover would likely bolster confidence in BA’s future (and, thus, help the share price). Is it time to be greedy when others are fearful?

2024-09-15 00:10:00,r/BerkshireHathaway,Buffett gifted tiny BRK.b to unidentified - why?,"Any guesses? Since I asked I will put my guesses forward.

1. Most likely individuals who need and can use the money immediately.

2. Precisely within a day or two of stock market bottom (in March 2009) Charlie gifted much larger portions of his estate to his kids. That may be repeating - at very lower scale. The drop after Ajit Jain’s recent sells may be too steep. If this is the real reason then we may see some buys. In other words, think of gifting (where the giftee holds for long term) as an inverse of sell rather than actual sell.

In an unrelated topic re buyback, I am wondering if something else is brewing in Omaha.

In upcoming months, Buffett may be getting ready to buyback in bulk before 1-4% tax on buybacks becomes the law. But buying back in bulk without moving the needle isn’t going to be easy for Buffett - who bought back barely $77b stock in last five years? Contrast that with how lovingly he wrote $0.5-1B checks to cash out early shareholder estates during this year.

Given that ease of billion dollar buy backs in two transactions, with largest shareholders ready to sell to him directly, and gigantic cash pile at hand, it won’t be an outlandish scenario for Berkshire to combine about 20-50 such buybacks and announce those in one swoop. 

I don’t understand SEC implications of such bunching. I am sure Buffett won’t do it illegally. So all of this is just my guess but unrelated to the tiny sells reported yesterday.

I have no desire to defend any of the guesses above but would love to learn any opinions etc from others.",10,3,kulsoul,https://www.reddit.com/r/BerkshireHathaway/comments/1fgxc16/buffett_gifted_tiny_brkb_to_unidentified_why/,1fgxc16

2024-09-12 22:25:09,r/BerkshireHathaway,Coca cola vs Apple,"Hello fellow partners, I have been reading and thinking about the Berkshire´s reduction of shares in Apple and Bac. I have been thinking, that it is interesting that during this ""trimming period"" Berkshire didn´t sell infrastructure brands, but more importantly coca cola. I understand the long term prospect of coca cola, and I am not for, or against selling the shares of these companies, however, what do you think is the reasoning of Berkshire when deciding what to trim, and what to keep. Obviously the valuation, on the other hand I also feel that some brands are more long term stable than others. What do you think?

Also the follow up question, is the money pile. To be honest I am glad that Brk has the ability to sell it´s shares and build up the cash pile, while getting a nice interest, however do you think this pile is suitable for the middle term? My thinking is also, that maybe Berkshire is trying to wait out the election period, as either candidate can lead the country quite the different way, influecning the businesses and stock market. In any case I have read and seen mr Buffet, frequently saying that if there is not the right opportunity, he will not ""swing"" and if the money piles up, it piles up. Do you think Berkshire will keep this strategy even when they hold 1/3 of their market capitalization in cash? Also does it concern you, that in a period of lowering interest rates the company could not reach the same interest on it´s univested cashpile as before ?

2024-09-12 13:51:58,r/BerkshireHathaway,What are you really getting when you buy BRK-B or BRK-A?  Old line businesses that form the underbelly of American economy. You're getting well-run and profitable US business segments: financial services; energy &amp; utilities; transport &amp; distribution. Then there is the portfolio,"I'm gonna think aloud here and see what I'm really buying with these 2 stocks, which are an amalgam of diversified businesses plus Buffet's portfolio.  

In terms of 2023 revenue, BRK's core businesses are insurance (26%), energy - BHE (7%), freight railway &amp; transport - BNSF &amp; PTC (21%), manufacturing (21%), service &amp; retail (11%), wholesale distribution - McLane (14%).  Now, these are some tremendously diversified businesses and Buffet obviously knows a lot about these business segments.  They represent the non-tech and old economy segments of the US business.  

But Buffett also has a $280 billion portfolio which regularly beats the S&amp;P 500:  30% of his portfolio consists of Apple, 30% of which includes banking, financial services and insurance like BAC, Amex and Chubb, 13% of which is consumer staples like KO and KHC, and 12.5% in Chevron and Occidental Petroleum.  There is also a large cash pile of $277b which hasn't been invested yet and are earning interest at the US Treasury Bill rate of \~5.3%.  

If you combine the 2, the portfolio portion and BRK businesses, you are capturing a pretty big slice of Americana.  You're getting financials, energy, railway-transport &amp; distribution, packaged foods and some manufacturing even.  

The current enterprise value of BRK is $1.1 trillion, $977b of which is the equity market cap and the portfolio is marked to market at $557b ($280 + $277).  Assume here that the cash earning the USTB rate is in the portfolio portion of the BRK business.  So, here is the allocation:  Buffett's portfolio = 557 / 1,100 = 51%; BRK businesses = 1,100 - 557 = 543b, which is 49%.  They're about even.  

Conclusion:  when you buy BRK-B or BRK-A, you're capturing about half and half of Buffett's famed portfolio and Berkshire's old line businesses.  Except for AAPL and small stakes in companies like AMZN and VRSN, essentially, what you're owning is the non-tech portion of America's old line business.  

  
Further question:  if you own BRK-B or BRK-A, should you round out by buying some XLK or SMH?  Well, that's up to you.",27,3,McHammer826,https://www.reddit.com/r/BerkshireHathaway/comments/1ff0ngd/what_are_you_really_getting_when_you_buy_brkb_or/,1ff0ngd

Berkshire market cap \~$988B



Buffett owning \~37%  or \~ 369B (practically zero cost basis vs. the current value)



If the capital tax plan goes in after election for 28% on those with high net worth...



W.B would potentially owe a tax of $128B to bring his cost basis up to current share price levels



To cover the $128B, Berkshire could pay a dividend to all shareholders total \~277B



$270B cash is about how much Berkshire has



Estimate this would be a one time dividend of $128 per B share

2024-09-08 13:05:17,r/BerkshireHathaway,Berkshire - back of an envelope valuation of the conglomerate,"Berkshire has raced up recently, outperforming the S&amp;P500 over 1 year and 5 years. I want to know what's inside and whether it's undervalued, overvalued, or fairly valued so that I can decide what to do with my position.

Cash - 277B  
This is mostly short term treasury bills. Subtracting the cash from the market cap of 990B, we are left with an equity valuation of 713B

Stock portfolio - 307B  
Taking the naive assumption that these stocks are well priced by the market and there is no such thing as a 'Buffet-premium' on the portfolio, we are left with 713-307 = 406B for the remainder of the company

Privately held businesses - 406B assumed valuation  
I went through the last 4 quarters and added together revenues minus expenses of both segments in the privately held section. This gave me a figure for income before taxes of 52 billion. I'll take the corporate tax rate of 21% and get a ballpark 'net income' for the privately held businesses of 41 billion. This gives a roughly 10% earnings yield. Given the solid moats but slow growth on these insurance, industrial, railroads, and other businesses, I'd say this is a fair valuation.

Overall I'd say that Berkshire looks to be in fair value territory and still a safe hold for a defensive position. In my opinion the questions we each have to answer for ourselves are:  
  
1 - Do we want to hold this amount of cash while interest rates are on the way down?  
2 - Are we comfortable with the stock picking?  
3 - Are we happy with the post-Buffett management team?

But I think some could easily expand, a lot. Some examples are:
- Nebraska Furniture Mart - I think there are 5 locations now, with another slated to open in Texas soon. I feel like there could be at least one NFM in each state. No reason why it couldn’t expand globally either.

- Berkshire Hathaway Automotive - dealerships remain an attractive business and are being undervalued by the market (public company dealerships trade in single digit p/e’s). Buffett spoke about buying more dealerships when they bought the company, but I don’t think they have acquired even one dealership so far.

- Borsheims - I realize that the one store location serves customers across the country, but surely expanding the footprint of the brand would result in way more sales. I don’t think there can be a borsheims in every state, but what about one in every major city, or have a few for all the major regions of the country?

Sorry that I am neither an experienced investor nor someone who knows any market (incl. Japan) very well so this question might appear as dumb. However, I'd like to train my brain to understand the markets a little bit more, hence my question below. 

Thanks for your time in advance.

I know that the situation might have changed so Buffett has now invested in Japan but if we turn the time back to 1989, in this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z6x-Ov1smU&amp;t=4210s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z6x-Ov1smU&amp;t=4210s) (at 7:23), he said that he could not find any attractive Japanese companies, even in the booming years and he said the Japanese had great economy but the companies had very low return on equities and did not make much money.

I have found this difficult to understand. The Japanese firms have always had good dividend yields. During the booming years, their share prices went through the roof. 711's operating margin is higher than their counterparts in North America. To me, since the 90s, they seem to have lost the innovation engine but if we think about day to day businesses, they have always been very well run and making money. 

Could someone please enlighten me?

","So for a bit of context, I put a fixed portion of my salary each month into S&amp;P, Total World and a bunch of blue chip stocks such as Microsoft, JPM, BRK, Amazon each month. I built this “portfolio” 4 years ago and am up 30% or so, the reason for the “perceived” underperformance is that I’ve increased my monthly contributions since last year which has led to a large rise in average cost basis. I’m hoping to cross the 100k mark in the next 12 months if the current trajectory continues. 

While I recognize that investing is a long-term game, the process feels slow at times. I'm curious to hear from others who have pursued a similar passive investing strategy.

How long did it take for your portfolio to reach a point where the annual passive income matched or exceeded your annual salary? When did you feel comfortable enough with your portfolio's performance and size to consider retiring or achieving financial independence.

2024-08-11 23:32:40,r/BerkshireHathaway,Berkshire vs S&amp;P 500,"Wondered what people thought about the following data.

I've taken the figures from the annual report, and run them backwards, to see how Berkshire has done recently against the S&amp;P500.  I've always thought it was odd that the annual report doesn't do it this way, as it's a more meaningful measure for todays investors.

In summary, if you've invested at some point in the last 16 years, it's probably the case that you've lost out relatively.  I think it's unlikely that Berkshire will catch up with the S&amp;P500 from 16 years ago.

Thoughts?  From my perspective the wheels came off roughly when QE started.

2024-08-04 20:38:43,r/BerkshireHathaway,What is your current valuation for BRKB per share?,"All these changes of course have me a little on edge.  But, one thing that helps with owning this stock is that I feel that I really know it's true value.  So, if it were to go down for some reason, I feel good knowing what I own.  I just read a nice article on Seeking Alpha where the author did a 'sum of the parts' valuation that led to a current value of $452.   Here is a cross check that I did as well based on P/E.

The current S/P P/E I believe is very high, around 26 maybe.   Berkshire is on target these days to do an operating profit of around $40B per year.   On top of that they have still around a $300B portfolio of stocks, and let's say those go up a modest 6% a year(dividends are counted in operating earnings) - which is an additional 18B per year.    That's a normalized $58B per year of earnings.   Even a 20 multiple on the stock puts it at a 1.16T company.   Dividing that by the equivalent B shares of 2,155M gives me a $454 price.  I'm seeing a $465 price target average going forward and Morningstar last value before earnings around current price.  FYI - operating profits per share were +17% versus a year ago, a big beat.

2024-08-01 20:13:46,r/stocks,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&amp;P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&amp;P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

|+|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&amp;P 500 over the next 24 months.

2024-08-01 12:50:51,r/BerkshireHathaway,"Berkshire's Lubrizol to Build Major Manufacturing Facility in Aurangabad, India","Berkshire Hathaway’s The Lubrizol Corporation, a global leader in specialty chemicals, has announced its plan to purchase a 120-acre plot in Aurangabad, India. This new manufacturing facility will initially support the region’s growing transportation and industrial fluid markets. The first phase of this project, representing an investment of around $200 million, marks Lubrizol’s largest investment in India to date and builds on previous commitments in the region.

Upon completion, the Aurangabad plant will become Lubrizol’s second-largest manufacturing facility worldwide and its largest in India. Construction will proceed in phases over the next several years, with provisions for future expansion.

“Lubrizol has made meaningful investments in India for more than five decades,” said Flavio Kliger, President of Lubrizol Additives. “This new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility will enhance our local capacity and capabilities for our Additives business, with potential support for other Lubrizol businesses and regions in the future.”

The announcement of the Aurangabad plant aligns with Lubrizol’s strategy to boost local growth and capacity. In 2023, Lubrizol announced its most significant investment in over 50 years in India, including a $150 million pledge. This investment supports the construction of the world’s largest CPVC resin plant in Vilayat, Gujarat, doubling capacity at the Dahej site, opening a grease lab in Navi Mumbai, and fostering in-country job growth and innovation. Additionally, the company opened its first Global Capability Center in Pune this year to drive regional growth and collaboration.

I’ve realized that they are good assets with property near interstate exits and they’re always busy, clean, and stocked. Fuel prices seem to be more competitive now and not as overpriced as they once were. When I stop at Pilot I know I can get a large, clean bathroom and a fuel pump right away, so I’ll continue to pick Pilot over others.

2024-07-31 13:15:56,r/BerkshireHathaway,Berkshire's Brooks Running Achieves Record Quarterly Revenue in Q2 2024,"Brooks Running, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, has set a new global quarterly revenue record in Q2 2024, marking a 15% year-over-year increase. This growth was driven by robust performance in both wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels.

In North America, Brooks saw a 19% year-over-year revenue increase, fueled by the success of the Glycerin 21 super franchise, Ghost Max, and the launch of Ghost 16. The brand has maintained its No. 1 market share in the adult performance running footwear market at U.S. national retail for the 10th consecutive quarter and held the top spot in the U.S. specialty footwear retail segment through the first half of 2024.

The Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region also returned to growth, with a 4% revenue increase as the retail landscape improved. In France and Germany, Brooks’ market share in the adult performance running footwear category grew nearly a full point year over year, with sales up 12% in France and 10% in Germany in Q1 2024 compared to Q1 2023.

In the Asia Pacific and Latin America (APLA) region, Brooks recently opened its first retail store in Shanghai, with a second location planned for later this year, along with new storefronts in Beijing and Guangzhou.

2024-07-31 02:47:42,r/BerkshireHathaway,Proud owner ,"Greetings 🖖🏻 

Late to the party with this great company - was saving up for a house, but I decided to park part of my nest egg it in BRK-B for now.  I pulled the trigger and purchased 225 shares today at $443/share.  I may regret this short term if the price goes down in a meaningful way, but I think if you zoom out on their track record, time being an owner beats trying to time it perfectly.  

My thesis is pretty simple: Warren B. &amp; company are a lot better at allocating money than I probably ever will be, so who am I to think I can beat their returns on a consistent basis? 

I wish I had the money I have now 4-5 years ago, but as they say, the second best time to plant a tree is today.  

Please feel free to laugh at me and tell me I’m making a mistake.  Would love to hear from long term owners.

Edit:  well boys and girls, my timing sucks, but I’m locked in for the long ride.  Bad timing is my middle name, but I am still confident it’ll be good in the end.  Good luck out there!",51,13,Chadzilla-,https://www.reddit.com/r/BerkshireHathaway/comments/1eg9wji/proud_owner/,1eg9wji

I really think Buffett wants to use current oportunity to lock in good interest on treasuries, which will be much more valuable once interest rates start going down, tbh I am almost sure that in next years we will be looking at current rates as historically high regardless of who wins the elections.

I looked at Blackrock, and it seem to be doing fine. 6 bln income growing YoY, and 11bln in debt, which is ok. The company has a strong competitive position, over 11tn in assets under management, and an healthy PE of 20. I think that growth is likely to continue, (rising valuations, launch on new blackrock ETFs, service expansion) and their position is too dominant to be disrupted. I am not sure of their pricing power though, their ETFs clients are very sensitive, but at that scale they should fund a way to monetize (revenue is around 0.17% of their AUM). I don't see much risk, except for valuation, but I would like to hear different opinion and see if I am missing something.",12,10,APC2_19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dzuh1i/what_are_your_thoughts_on_blackrock_as_a/,1dzuh1i

2024-06-26 22:10:53,r/stocks,Thoughts on D&amp;B and financial data stocks - 52 week lows,"Currently researching a few fintech stocks and noticed the financial data provider stocks are a quiet niche. In fact, a few names are near their 52-week lows (DNB, FDS, MSCI).

Dun &amp; Bradstreet caught my eye for a few reasons. First, it is oldest company on the list (1841). The next two oldest stocks are S&amp;P (1860) and Moody's (1909). The longevity of all three names surprised me. You'd think financial data stocks would have shorter lifespans.

Either way, D&amp;B is interesting because of its upside down balance sheet. Bill Foley, a notable fintech investor, took D&amp;B private in 2018 for $5.4b. He's also a large stakeholder of $FNF and $FIS. But since going public again, D&amp;B is burdened with too much debt. The company is barely breaking even. And the stock has been trending downwards since the IPO.

Now I don't think think the company will go out of business. But the stock will probably fall another 40-50% and stabilize to $4-5 per share. Which will make it interesting and less risky. $5 would be the floor since larger buyers would sweep in to avoid it from delisting on the NYSE. Plus the market cap would be \~$2b at that point. More people will look into it.

The downsides are the heavy debt load and downward spiral stock price. The upside is the longevity and business model. It's worth noting that Cognizant $CTSH and Moody's spun out of D&amp;B too. Both of which are excellent businesses. $BRK owns 13% of $MCO.

I'm interested to hear your experience using these data providers and D&amp;B. FactSet is also near its 52-week low but a much better business model. I'll be looking into that name next.

2024-06-15 19:18:59,r/BerkshireHathaway,Berkshire Hathaway vs. SPY ETF: A Comparative Analysis,"I was researching whether to buy Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) or the SPY ETF. After considerable reading, I am surprised that so many people believe BRK has outperformed SPY by nearly double...this is simply not true.

I did a careful analysis of BRK (which does not pay out dividends) to SPY (assuming reinvestment of dividends, aka ""Total Return""). This is a fair comparison from the shareholder's perspective, whereby all cash flows from both investments are reinvested. BRK does it for you, and your broker can usually set up automatic reinvestment of dividends for SPY. Keep in mind SPY price charts DO NOT include reinvested dividends, so comparing the charts of BRK vs. SPY produces an incomplete comparison. You must compare BRK to SPY TOTAL RETURN charts.

# Analysis Overview

My analysis is over the last 20 years using historical pricing data for BRK-A and SPY: 

||||INCORRECT|CORRECT|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
||**5/31/2004**|**6/14/2024**|**Return w/o DIV**|**Return w/DIV**|
|**SPY**|$112.86|$542.78|380.93%|590.00%|
|**BRK-A**|$89,000|$610,900|586.40%|586.40%|

**Summary:** When incorrectly comparing the 586% BRK return to the 380% SPY return, BRK appears to have a much higher return. However, when correctly comparing the returns with reinvested SPY dividends, SPY (590%) slightly outperforms BRK (586%). In fact, SPY slightly beat BRK over the last 20 years, 15 years, 5 years, 1 year, and YTD periods.

Occidental Petroleum is below Berskshire's option exercise level of $59.624
","Anyone following Buffett's favorite company?  He loves OXY and continued to purchase shares in OXY even in Q1 at around $57.5.  The thing about OXY is that it will usually trade between $62 to $70 but will occasionally fall to the level where Berkshire can exercise its options for 83.9 million additional shares at $59.624.  That's 9.5% in additional shares and the stock must already be accounting for the dilution.

So who's still buying at this level?  Do you believe in Buffett's thesis for OXY?  Or are there other energy companies that you think might fare better in the energy markets that are evolving for the changing geopolitics of the second half of the 2020s and into the 2030s?  Yes, it's getting some renewable exposure but this is still a Permian Basin play, where it's not so clear if we've maxed out or not.

2024-05-09 20:43:56,r/BerkshireHathaway,Some things that I extracted from 2024 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting ,"The people who check the price daily have not made the money . The people who’ve forgotten about it basically have over the years.

We had a lot of fun : doing anything,We played golf together , we played tennis together , we did everything together 

And you may find it kind of interesting we had as much fun , perhaps even more to some extent with things that failed because then we really had to work and work our way out of them 

There are certain things that just take a certain amount of time, my daughter hates when I use this example . It’s really true that you can’t create a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant 

I mean you may want a baby but there are certain laws of nature that you have to work with 

I would try in a very very general way look back in your life and think about yourself and start today to go on the path that leads to that goal and expects some difficulties along the way but if you’re thinking that way you’re more likely to get there 

I would do it better this time around than 2008 y 9 if something of that happens but it wouldn’t be exactly like 2008 y 9 you can be sure of that but you can say that There will be times when having huge sums available extremely quickly maybe it could be once every five  years , maybe once every 10 years 

As the world gets more sophisticated and complicated and intertwined more can go wrong and there’s no sense going through it exploring all the possibilities that ever could happens but you do wanna be able to act when that happens 

And I think the chief executive should be somebody that can wait buying businesses buying stocks doing all kind of things that may come up at a time when nobody else is willing to move 

It wasn’t that people didn’t have money in 2008 it is that they were paralyzed and we did the advantage of having some capital and the willingness and eagerness even to act 

All of those qualities would be even more important as our capital pile up so I think Greg may have even more fun than I had in a period when extraordinary things were happening and we were the logical place to go

You never know whether it would be next week, next year, next decade but it wouldn’t be a century from now for sure 

The answer would be in my particular case Going through the 20.000 pages and since we’re talking about rail roads I went through the moody’s transportation manual a couple of times that was 1500 o 2000 pages or probably 1500 pages and I found all kinds of interesting things when I was 20 or 21 and 

I don’t image that’s there anybody here that know about the Green Bay and western railroad company but There were hundreds and hundreds of railroads companies and I like to read about every one of them 

The Green Bay western. In those days everybody had a nickname  for railroads . 

The Green Bay western was known as grab , buy it and walk , gbw. They had a bond that was actually a common stock and a common stock that was actually a bond 

That could lead to unusual things but they would lead to unusual things that were worth for you many millions of dollars 

But if you collected a whole bunch of those which I setup to do and actually that was impressed Charlie when I first met him because I knew all the details of all those little companies in the west cost we had never heard of 

He thought he was the only one that knew about that became an instant point of connection 

I don’t know what the equivalent of Moody’s manual or anything would be now but I would find everything about everything small and I would find something and with a million dollar you can earn 50% a year but you have to be in love with the subject, you can’t just be in love with the money, you got just to find it essentially. You know people find other things in other fields because they just love looking for something because they want to find something 

I don’t know how the human brain works but there’s different people that just find that exciting to expand their knowledge in a given area 

You can’t do it if you really if you don’t find the game of interest wether is bridge or whatever it may be chest or in this case finding securities that are undervalued but it sounds to me like you are in the right track 

I mean anybody that come all the way to this annual meeting have something in their mind rather than bridge or chest so I’m glad you came and come again next year

2024-05-03 19:28:05,r/BerkshireHathaway,Berkshire Hathaway’s big mystery stock wager could be revealed soon [CNBC],"[Berkshire Hathaway](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BRK.B/), led by legendary investor [Warren Buffett,](https://www.cnbc.com/warren-buffett/) has been making a [confidential](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/18/buffetts-berkshire-keeps-new-stock-pick-secret-again-what-it-means.html) wager on the financial industry since the third quarter of last year.

The identity of the stock — or stocks — that Berkshire has been snapping up could be revealed Saturday at the company’s annual shareholder [meeting](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/02/souring-on-apple-mystery-bank-stock-buffett-may-clarify-portfolio-at-annual-meeting.html) in Omaha, Nebraska.

That’s because unless Berkshire has been granted [confidential](https://www.cnbc.com/berkshire-hathaway-portfolio/) treatment on the investment for a third quarter in a row, the stake will be disclosed in filings later this month. So the 93-year-old Berkshire CEO may decide to explain his rationale to the thousands of investors flocking to the gathering.

The bet, shrouded in mystery, has captivated Berkshire investors since it first [appeared](https://www.barrons.com/articles/berkshire-hathaway-warren-buffett-mystery-stock-1f8ddcb1) in disclosures late last year. At a time when Buffett has been a net seller of stocks and lamented a dearth of opportunities capable of “truly moving [the needle](https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-returns-investors-2e0acca9) at Berkshire,” he has apparently found something he likes — and in the financial realm no less.

That’s an area he has [dialed back](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/28/bank-stocks-once-a-buffett-favorite-take-a-back-seat-at-berkshire-hathaway.html) on in recent years over concerns about rising loan defaults. High interest rates have taken a toll on some financial players like regional U.S. banks, while making the yield on Berkshire’s cash pile in instruments like T-bills suddenly attractive.

“When you are the GOAT of investing, people are interested in what you think is good,” said Glenview Trust Co. Chief Investment Officer [Bill Stone](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billstone-cfa-cmt/), using an acronym for greatest of all time. “What makes it even more exciting is that banks are in his circle of competence.”

Under Buffett, Berkshire has [trounced](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2023ar/2023ar.pdf) the S&amp;P 500 over nearly six decades with a 19.8% compounded annual gain, compared with the 10.2% yearly rise of the index.

# Veiled bets

Berkshire requested anonymity for the trades because if the stock was known before the conglomerate finished building its position, others would plow into the stock as well, driving up the price, according to [David Kass](https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/directory/david-kass), a finance professor at the University of Maryland.

Buffett is said to control roughly 90% of Berkshire’s massive stock portfolio, leaving his deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler the rest, Kass said.

While investment disclosures give no clue as to what the stock could be, Stone, Kass and other Buffett watchers believe it is a multibillion-dollar wager on a financial name.

That’s because the cost basis of banks, insurers and finance stocks owned by the company jumped by $3.59 billion in the second half of last year, the only category to increase, according to separate Berkshire [filings](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2023ar/2023ar.pdf).

At the same time, Berkshire exited financial names by dumping insurers [Markel](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MKL/) and [Globe Life](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GL/), leading investors to estimate that the wager could be as large as $4 billion or $5 billion through the end of 2023. It’s unknown whether that bet was on one company or spread over multiple firms in an industry.

# Schwab or Morgan Stanley?

If it were a classic Buffett bet — a big stake in a single company —  that stock would have to be a large one, with perhaps a $100 billion market capitalization. Holdings of at least 5% in publicly traded American companies trigger [disclosure](https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-final-rules-regarding-beneficial-ownership-231010#:~:text=In%201970%2C%20Congress%20lowered%20the,a%20public%20company's%20equity%20securities.) requirements.

Investors have been speculating for months about what the stock could be. Finance covers all manner of companies, from retail lenders to Wall Street brokers, payments companies and various sectors of insurance.

[Charles Schwab](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SCHW/) or [Morgan Stanley](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MS/) could fit the bill, according to [James Shanahan](https://www.edwardjones.com/us-en/why-edward-jones/news-media/thought-leadership/financial-analysts/james-shanahan), an Edward Jones analyst who covers banks and Berkshire Hathaway.

“Schwab was beaten down during the regional banking crisis last year, they had an issue where retail investors were trading out of cash into higher-yielding investments,” Shanahan said. “Nobody wanted to own that name last year, so Buffett could’ve bought as much as he wanted.”

Other names that have been circulated — [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JPM/) or [BlackRock](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BLK/), for example, are possible, but may make less sense given valuations or business mix. [Truist](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TFC/) and other higher-quality regional banks might also fit Buffett’s parameters, as well as insurer [AIG](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AIG/), Shanahan said, though their market capitalizations are smaller.

# Buffett &amp; banks

Berkshire has owned financial names [for decades](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/28/bank-stocks-once-a-buffett-favorite-take-a-back-seat-at-berkshire-hathaway.html), and Buffett has stepped in to inject capital — and confidence — into the industry on multiple occasions.

Buffett served as CEO of a scandal-stricken Salomon Brothers in the early 1990s to help turn the company around. He pumped $5 billion into [Goldman Sachs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GS/) in 2008 and another $5 billion into [Bank of America](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BAC/) in 2011, ultimately becoming the latter’s largest shareholder.

But after loading up on lenders in 2018, from universal banks like JPMorgan to regional lenders like [PNC Financial](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PNC/) and [U.S. Bank](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/USB/), he deeply pared his exposure to the sector in 2020 on concerns that the coronavirus pandemic would punish the industry.

Since then, he and his deputies have mostly avoided adding to his finance stakes, besides modest positions in [Citigroup](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/C/) and [Capital One](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/COF/).

# ‘Fear is contagious’

Last May, Buffett told shareholders to expect more [turbulence](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/06/warren-buffett-says-american-banks-could-face-more-turbulence-ahead-but-deposits-are-safe.html) in banking. He said Berkshire could deploy more capital in the industry, if needed.

“The situation in banking is very similar to what it’s always been in banking, which is that fear is contagious,” Buffett said. “Historically, sometimes the fear was justified, sometimes it wasn’t.”

Wherever he placed his bet, the move will be seen as a boost to the company, perhaps even the sector, given Buffett’s track record of identifying value.

It’s unclear how long regulators will allow Berkshire to shield its moves.

“I’m hopeful he’ll reveal the name and talk about the strategy behind it,” Shanahan said. “The SEC’s patience can wear out, at some point it’ll look like Berkshire’s getting favorable treatment.”",12,0,[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/BerkshireHathaway/comments/1cjecji/berkshire_hathaways_big_mystery_stock_wager_could/,1cjecji

My plan is:   
Friday: Arrive at midnight, so can't attend any activities in Friday.  
Saturday: Attend the meeting and Join the picnic after meeting.  
Sunday: 5K running, enjoy Gorat's Steak House (Warren's favorite), visit the outside of Warren's house, visit Borsheims Shareholder-only Shopping event.  


1. The door will open at 7am, when is the latest time I should arrive? To at least ensure a seat to sit.
2. Do you guys recommend to join the picnic after meeting?
3.  The 5k running is from 8am to 11am. Can I start at 9am? (I don't wanna wake up that early) Or all of runners need to start at 8am.
4. Do you guys recommend to visit Borsheims Shareholder-only Shopping event? It is so far from CHI health center.

2024-04-04 15:50:20,r/BerkshireHathaway,Berkshire Granted Approval to Substantially Increase Stake in OXY,"The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has greenlit Berkshire Hathaway’s expansion of its stake in Occidental Petroleum, deeming it “consistent with the public interest.” This move permits Berkshire to boost its ownership in the energy giant up to fifty percent.

Warren Buffett, the driving force behind Berkshire Hathaway’s major investment decisions, has articulated the company’s positive stance on Occidental Petroleum. At the 2023 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting, Buffett expressed favor towards Occidental’s position in the Permian Basin, highlighting its strategic significance. However, he emphasized that Berkshire has no intentions of acquiring a controlling interest in the company. Buffett reiterated confidence in Occidental’s existing management, asserting, “we wouldn’t know what to do with it.”

In addition to its ongoing open market purchases, Berkshire Hathaway holds warrants enabling it to acquire 80 million Occidental shares at an exercise price of $62.50 per share. These warrants were obtained in 2019 when Berkshire provided $10 billion, facilitating Occidental’s successful bid of $38 billion to acquire Anadarko Petroleum, outbidding industry heavyweight Chevron.

Berkshire Hathaway’s increasing stake in Occidental Petroleum underscores its continued confidence in the energy sector and strategic investments aligned with its long-term vision.

I've red many books about the methods adopted by Buffett and Mungler at Berkshire Hathaway.

What's hit me was the semplicity about the Fundamental Analysis used to evaluate a Companies: few tools and formulas, mostly focused on calculation of Future Profits, market price and outlook.

I was wandering if there are websites, or Excel Templates avaiable, close to the ones that ""Buffett"" uses, that could help me to analyze as he does. 

Many years ago Joel Greenblatt's formula was a website.

Is there anything close about Warren &amp; Mungler?

2024-03-05 22:45:40,r/BerkshireHathaway,A Berkshire Winner! Davita Rockets to All-Time High,"Berkshire Hathaway, the renowned investment conglomerate led by Warren Buffett, is often celebrated for its strategic investments in household names like Apple, Bank of America, American Express, and Coca-Cola. However, one lesser-known gem in its portfolio is its nearly 40 percent ownership stake in DaVita, a leading global healthcare company specializing in kidney care.

DaVita operates dialysis centers across the United States and in 10 other countries, solidifying its position as a key player in the healthcare industry. As of December 31, 2023, Berkshire Hathaway held a substantial  36,095,570 shares of DaVita, making it one of the company’s top domestic holdings.

The investment has proven highly lucrative for Berkshire Hathaway, with DaVita’s stock surging over 7 percent on March 5, 2024, reaching an all-time high of $134.65 per share. This remarkable performance has been driven in part by DaVita’s aggressive share buyback program, which has effectively increased Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in the company without requiring additional investment.

DaVita’s impressive financial performance further underscores its importance in Berkshire Hathaway’s investment strategy. With a one-year return of 67.89 percent and a five-year return of 169.57 percent, DaVita stands out as one of Berkshire’s top-performing investments.

In discussions about Berkshire Hathaway’s patient and strategic approach to investing, DaVita should not be overlooked. Its success highlights the value of thorough research and long-term investment strategies in achieving substantial returns in the ever-evolving landscape of the stock market.

In 2023, PCC’s revenues surged to $9.3 billion, marking a notable increase of $1.7 billion or 22.7% compared to the previous year. This impressive growth was primarily fueled by heightened demand for aerospace products, which form a substantial part of PCC’s revenue stream. Additionally, contributions from power/energy and general and industrial products also played a role in driving overall revenue growth.

The surge in demand for aerospace products aligns with long-term industry forecasts, which project sustained growth and robust demand for air travel and aerospace products.

2024-02-24 21:07:27,r/BerkshireHathaway,Berkshire True P/E Q4,"As stated in the Q4 press release 

“The amount of investment gains/losses in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net earnings (losses) per share that can be extremely misleading to investors who have little or no knowledge of accounting rules.”

  
That being said, the record earnings for Q4 of 96B is “meaningless” and what we as investors should focus on is the operating earnings of 37.35B for the full year which is a pretty wicked number 21% higher than 2022 @ 30.85B. Using 37.35 net earnings and todays market cap of 905B would give **BRK a P/E of 24.46.**

  
What a beauty of a run this name has had recently, but does it have legs from here? Seems like a pretty fair P/E for a diversified conglomerate, really needs to pull some tricks with that cash pile if they are going to move the needle. But it’s never been a better time to have “extreme fiscal conservatism“ - we can sleep at night, and that’s a rare quality these days.

Neither position has been adjusted since and for a while the ownership % and unrealized gains were moving in lockstep with each other. Now:

- Coke on the other hand continues to expand its sharecount, diluting Berkshires ownership percentage. It was around 10%, and now is around 9.3%. The unrealized gain has also fallen behind at over $23 billion. The annual dividend is approximately $700 million.

Just illustrates the power of a company that consistently reduces its share count over time. Should these trends continue, eventually Berkshire might own over 30% of Amex and might change its treatment of the investment to equity method…

2024-02-13 20:59:45,r/BerkshireHathaway,Berkshire’s Brooks Running Achieved Record-Breaking Success in 2023,"In the dynamic world of performance running footwear, Brooks Running, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, emerged as a frontrunner in 2023, achieving remarkable milestones and solidifying its position as a leader in the industry. The company reported a record revenue growth of $1.2 billion, marking a significant 5% increase year over year. Moreover, Brooks witnessed a historic achievement of selling over 20 million units, showcasing its widespread consumer appeal and market penetration.

Since 2018, Brooks has consistently demonstrated impressive growth, boasting a compound annual growth rate surpassing 14%. This growth trajectory continued in 2023, particularly in North America, where revenue surged by 7%, surpassing the $1 billion mark for the first time in the region’s history. This achievement underscored Brooks’ effective multichannel business strategy, which included inventory optimization, strategic investments in key markets, and the delivery of premium performance products across various regions.

The success story of Brooks extends beyond financial metrics, as evidenced by its dominant presence in the adult performance running footwear market. The brand maintained its coveted position as the top player in the U.S. retail market, capturing a remarkable 21% market share throughout the year. Key products such as the Brooks Ghost and Adrenaline GTS shoes emerged as the top two adult performance running styles, commanding over 12% share collectively. Additionally, the Brooks Ghost garnered recognition in the fitness tracking realm, being among the top running styles on the popular app Strava.

Jim Weber, CEO of Brooks, expressed enthusiasm about the brand’s prospects, stating, “There has never been a more exciting time to be in run, especially for a brand as focused on it as Brooks.” He highlighted the thriving landscape of the U.S. retail market and the global increase in participation, emphasizing Brooks’ readiness to cater to a diverse audience seeking the physical, mental, and social benefits of running.

Brooks’ commitment to innovation remained unwavering in 2023, with a particular focus on product development. The performance running category experienced robust growth, outperforming the overall footwear market in the U.S. Brooks seized this opportunity by introducing the all-new Ghost Max, a groundbreaking addition to its Ghost franchise. The Ghost Max garnered unprecedented retail adoption, contributing to Brooks’ notable market share gain in the footwear segment.

For 2024, Brooks aims to build on its momentum with a robust pipeline of product launches and innovations across core footwear offerings. The brand’s strategic expansion efforts will focus on enhancing brand engagement and reaching a broader audience of runners, fitness enthusiasts, and walkers seeking high-performance products.

Has anyone seen the link this year for the form that can be printed and snail-mailed in to BRK for AGM passes?

2024-02-04 20:14:16,r/BerkshireHathaway,$CVS: More Pain Ahead or Healthier than Ever?,"*Note**: I originally shared this post to* r/ValueInvesting*.  The conversation was fantastic, so I'm also including some of my favorite comments here to encourage thoughtful discussion.* 

$CVS looks like a good value play after falling over 30% from its 2022 highs. I evaluate the stock from 5 key focus areas: (1) Revenue Growth (2) Earnings Growth (3) Balance Sheet Strength (4) Free Cash Flow (5) Valuation.

I'm sharing some of the highlights of my analysis below, but you can find the more in-depth analysis with supporting charts at the link below. Would love to hear thoughts on this one!

[***Link to Full Analysis w/ Charts***](https://open.substack.com/pub/intrinsicinsights/p/cvs-more-pain-ahead-or-healthier?r=2lehzc&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web)

**Revenue Growth**

Over the last 20 years, CVS has averaged a 13.8% top-line CAGR. Narrowing in on the last 10 years, this drops slightly to a 10.1% CAGR.In the last 2 decades, CVS has only had 1 year where revenue dropped year-over-year, which was in 2010 when it dropped \~2%. Even then, revenue has compounded at the rates previously mentioned over long enough horizons

**Earnings Growth**

In the last 10 years, CVS has compounded operating income by 8.5% annually and 13.9% annually if you extend 20 years back.

**Balance Sheet**

First, not all debt is collateralized against the business in the same way. Importantly, CVS has many physical retail locations that each enter into their own lease agreements. In other words, this does not carry the same level of risk that other debt/obligations would against the entire business. Almost a quarter of their debt comes from capital lease obligations, so the number looks higher than is really meaningful.If you were to back out capital lease obligations, the debt to EBITDA ratio would be closer to 3x, which is reasonably healthy.

**Free Cash Flow**

As CVS has aggressively paid down debt from the Aetna acquisition, our thesis is that more and more of the FCFE will go towards share buybacks in particular, ESPECIALLY considering CVS is trading at extremely attractive levels. This is also evident from the $3.5B in buybacks completed over the last year and management’s expressed desire to increase buybacks upon paying down debt to healthier levels.

**Valuation**

Over the past 20 years, CVS has traded around 14-15x blended earnings (average of LTM/NTM) quite consistently. Over the last couple years, the company has slowly declined towards 8.5x earnings and looks oversold by historical measures.

In the base case, where the business still grows well below the rates of the last 20 years, I would anticipate CVS to compound close to 14.7% annually though 2028 (assuming no dividends reinvested). This becomes very compelling relative to return expectations of the S&amp;P 500.

**Notable Comments re:** r/valueinvesting

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**""**Good historical analysis. As most will say, it’s the future that matters. As you mentioned I expect debt to be reduced and shares to be bought back. This is most important to metrics to mass market adoption of price increase.  
&gt;  
&gt;IMO the pharma + insurance angle will boost baseline earnings in the future. The insurance angle will cause some lumpiness and risk from regulation but will be a cornerstone to strong FCF. I’m not sure how much growth in top line will come but probably minimal. I’d be happy with that outcome alone knowing the FCF and earnings that come with it.  
&gt;  
&gt;One thing not discussed that I think they are uniquely positioned for is to develop their own line of generic medicines for big earnings and revenue boost. They can fill the gaps and use the data from pharma and insurance to find the biggest value ones. There have been a lot of medicines that have had their patents mature or will be maturing in the coming years so I imagine there’s some additional accretive value to the tied businesses.  
&gt;  
&gt;Short term pain but I’m holding long term so I’ll be happy in 5-10-15 years.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**""**There's a reason the PE is trading at 8x:  
&gt;  
&gt;50% of CVS' revenue is through PBMs (CVS Caremark). The PBM industry has bipartisan support to do more thorough digging into why drug prices have increased as much as they have. California completely dropped CVS' PBM from pricing generic drugs and has turned to Amazon and Mark Cuban's pharma company (although CVS is still pricing more complex drugs).  
&gt;  
&gt;There's also Aetna losing Centene as a customer as they are switching to Cigna ($35B contract value) [https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payers/cigna-posts-28b-profit-q3-earnings-beat](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payers/cigna-posts-28b-profit-q3-earnings-beat)  
&gt;  
&gt;GEHA completely dumping Aetna and switching to United Healthcare (I don't know the financial hit to CVS for this though).  
&gt;  
&gt;With that said, given the current financials CVS should be able to pay its debt and can afford to shed losses in Oak Street and Signify if they end up being poor investments. The 8x PE is basically a bet on whether the PBM can continue to grow in the future or not.""

&gt;Look at add to CVS. Strategy is 10% max per holding, investing purely off cashflows and keeping gap between SP and IV high all the time. Always buying with the intent to go long.  
&gt;  
&gt;Been watching CVS for awhile and bought a bit with dividend money, not enough to warrant putting too much time and research in.

Given that the majority of the market was buoyed by tech, and the tech industry is showing some signs of distress, and there is an expectation of a recession due to the inverted yield curve, I have a certain angst to staying invested in the market.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, known for its strategic acquisitions, has gone the other direction with the sale of Lubrizol Life Science business group Inc. from its portfolio.

The buyer, Agno Pharma, which purchased the company from Berkshire’s The Lubrizol Corporation, is a prominent US-based global pharmaceutical contract development and manufacturing company, is set to leverage this acquisition to enhance its capabilities and services.

The acquisition encompasses the drug product formulation technology associated with Particle Sciences Inc., as well as its development and manufacturing site located in Bethlehem, PA, which employs approximately 65 professionals.

The sale of the unit is a reverse for Lubrizol, which in 2019 had incorporated Particle Science into its Lubrizol Life Science business group. At that time, Lubrizol had also acquired Bavaria Medizin Technologie GmbH, a German contract development and manufacturing organization of intravascular and nonvascular devices.

Particle Sciences, established in 1991, specializes in pre-clinical and clinical stage drug product formulation, offering a comprehensive range of services, including analytic, bioanalytic, physical characterization, and manufacturing. The company excels in handling poorly soluble and highly potent compounds in both sterile and non-sterile environments.

The plan authorizes the company to buy back up to $3 billion of its outstanding common stock by December 26, 2026.

Under this share repurchase initiative, Kraft Heinz aims to use excess cash after allocating funds for disciplined capital spending. This includes investments to support organic growth in strategic areas of its business, the payment of a competitive dividend, maintaining a targeted Net Leverage of approximately 3.0x, and evaluating various strategic opportunities such as acquisitions, divestitures, and partnerships.

Miguel Patricio, CEO, and Chair of the Board at Kraft Heinz, emphasized the company’s recent transformation milestones in the third quarter. He stated, “In the third quarter, we hit a milestone in our transformation — reaching our targeted Net Leverage of approximately 3.0x. A stronger balance sheet, along with advancements we have made across the business, gives us further conviction behind our strategy and the belief that company shares are an attractive investment opportunity.”

2023-11-29 00:59:22,r/BerkshireHathaway,Top quoted from Charlie Minger RIP,"Charlie Munger, the esteemed partner of Warren Buffett in Berkshire Hathaway, has undeniably left an enduring imprint on the landscape of investing.

Reflecting on Charlie Munger's wisdom, several quotes stand out as epitomes of his philosophy. One of his famous maxims, ""Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up,"" encapsulates his emphasis on continuous learning. Similarly, his advice to ""Invert, always invert"" underscores the importance of approaching problems from different angles.

Another of his quips, ""It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."" This reflects his emphasis on avoiding costly mistakes.

Another gem from Munger is, ""The best thing a human being can do is help another human being know more."" This altruistic perspective on knowledge sharing reflects his commitment to personal and collective growth.

In conclusion, Charlie Munger's impact on investing is profound and multifaceted, evident not only in his partnership with Buffett but also in the timeless wisdom encapsulated in his notable quotes. His principles continue to guide and inspire investors on their journey toward enduring success",23,5,Helpful_Excuse_1103,https://www.reddit.com/r/BerkshireHathaway/comments/186b181/top_quoted_from_charlie_minger_rip/,186b181

2023-11-22 13:56:31,r/BerkshireHathaway,Warren Buffett’s Generous Thanksgiving Gesture: A Legacy of Giving Back,"On November 21, renowned investor Warren E. Buffett made a significant philanthropic move by converting 1,600 A shares into 2,400,000 B shares. The purpose behind this strategic maneuver was to donate these B shares to four family foundations, continuing his longstanding tradition of charitable giving. The breakdown of the donations includes 1,500,000 shares to The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, and 300,000 shares each to The Sherwood Foundation, The Howard G. Buffett Foundation, and NoVo Foundation. These generous contributions have been officially delivered as of today.

In a heartfelt message to his fellow shareholders, Mr. Buffett reflected on the recurring nature of these donations, noting their similarity to those made during the previous Thanksgiving. These contributions supplement the lifetime pledges he made in 2006, outlining various conditions that are consistently met by the recipients, as detailed on berkshirehathaway.com.

Buffett, now 93 years old, expressed amazement at the fact that his three children are between 65 and 70 years old. Over the years, their respective foundations have disbursed substantial sums, often supporting different causes. One common belief shared by the Buffett family is a skepticism toward dynastic wealth, despite its legality and prevalence worldwide. They acknowledge that wealth, in itself, does not guarantee wisdom or virtue. Emphasizing their faith in the positive impact of capitalism, despite its flaws, they celebrate the opportunities the United States has afforded them.

Buffett’s three children serve as both executors of his current will and trustees of the charitable trust set to receive 99%-plus of his wealth upon his demise. Although unprepared for this responsibility in 2006, they are now fully equipped to manage this significant philanthropic legacy. The testamentary trust, designed to be self-liquidating after a decade, will operate with a lean staff and be funded, to the extent possible, by Berkshire shares.

In acknowledging the inevitability of human errors within large organizations, public or private, Buffett expressed confidence in Berkshire’s ability to recognize and rectify mistakes. He assured shareholders that the company is well-positioned with the right CEO and Board of Directors to ensure its enduring success.

Looking ahead, Buffett stressed the importance of maintaining Berkshire’s distinctive characteristics and behavior. While his substantial holdings will provide short-term support, he emphasized that Berkshire will ultimately earn the reputation it deserves. Anticipating changes in laws related to philanthropy, he emphasized the need for a broad charter for the testamentary trust and the importance of wise trustees guiding its operations.

In a move that reflects transparency and openness, Buffett outlined his posthumous plans, assuring that the disposition of his assets will be an open book. Rejecting elaborate trusts or foreign entities, he opted for a simple will that will be available for public inspection at the Douglas County Courthouse.

As Thanksgiving approaches, Buffett expressed gratitude for the opportunities life has afforded him and extended warm wishes to all shareholders, hoping for health and happiness for them and their families. This latest act of generosity continues to expand Warren Buffett’s legacy as not only a financial wizard but also a philanthropist committed to making a positive impact on the world.

2023-11-10 14:25:14,r/BerkshireHathaway,NetJets Reports Strong Revenue Growth,"While the COVID-19 pandemic dealt a significant blow to commercial airlines with a sharp decline in travel, it unexpectedly ushered in a private jet travel boom for those with the means to indulge. Surprisingly, this trend continues to flourish, even as commercial jet travel makes a comeback. Berkshire Hathaway’s NetJets, a prominent player in the private aviation industry, has reported impressive revenue growth, with an 8.3% increase in the third quarter and an 11.5% rise in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022.

The surge in revenues can be attributed to several factors, including the expansion of shared aircraft ownership programs and a year-to-date surge in flight hours across NetJets’ diverse programs, all accompanied by higher average rates.

Notably, NetJets has been actively expanding its capacity, aiming to capitalize on the booming demand for private jet travel. In a significant move, the company joined forces with Textron Aviation in September, signing a record-breaking fleet agreement. This agreement grants NetJets the option to purchase up to 1,500 additional Cessna Citation business jets over the next 15 years. It extends NetJets’ existing fleet agreement and includes provisions for an increasing number of aircraft each year.

The surge in NetJets’ revenues paints a clear picture of the growing popularity of private jet travel. As travelers seek the flexibility, privacy, and safety that private aviation offers, companies like NetJets are poised for continued success. Even as commercial airlines make their comeback, the private jet industry is flying high, proving that luxury and convenience are increasingly becoming a top priority for those who can afford it.

Revenues reached $2.3 billion in the third quarter and a cumulative $6.9 billion in the first three quarters of the year. These figures represent an outstanding 21.4% growth in the third quarter and an even more remarkable 26.0% surge in the first nine months compared to the previous year.

The company’s pre-tax earnings grew 43.1% in the third quarter and 32.5% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. The strong results in 2023 were attributed to increases in sales and improved manufacturing and operating efficiencies.

In 2023, the company experienced higher demand for aerospace products, which formed the primary driver behind the impressive revenue increases. However, it’s worth noting that PCC’s diverse product portfolio, which includes power/energy and general and industrial products, also made substantial contributions to the overall financial success.

The aviation and aerospace industry has consistently shown resilience and robust growth, even amidst global challenges. The long-term industry forecasts underscore the promising outlook, predicting sustained expansion and a continued surge in demand for air travel and aerospace products.

As the world gradually rebounds from the challenges of the past couple of years, the appetite for aerospace innovations and travel experiences remains strong.

2023-11-02 12:50:48,r/BerkshireHathaway,Berkshire’s Brooks Anticipates Double-Digit Growth in 2024," Berkshire Hathaway’s Brooks Running has experienced remarkable success in 2023, with a 5% increase in global revenue and a 7% rise in North American revenue year-to-date.

The company’s achievements can be attributed to various factors, including its expansion into new markets, recovery from supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the normalization of inventory levels amidst economic challenges. Furthermore, the return of Brooks’ full product line and innovation pipeline, along with the exceptional launch of the Ghost Max shoe in late September, have been instrumental in driving the brand’s growth and instilling confidence in its ability to achieve double-digit growth in 2024.

**Leading the Market**

Brooks Running has continued to dominate the adult performance running footwear market in the United States. For the seventh consecutive quarter, the brand has held the number one spot with a 21.4% market share. According to the Running USA 2023 Global Running Survey, released recently, Brooks was also identified as the most preferred brand for training and racing footwear by event participants.

The media is reporting that they sold $25.8 million worth of shares:

https://www.reuters.com/business/berkshire-hathaway-sells-258-mln-worth-shares-chinas-byd-2023-10-31/

However this is only counting the last block of stock sold that took them under 8%. At the last disclosure, Berkshire owned just under 9%. So if you look at the last disclosure they had 98,603,142 shares  on June 19th, 2023 and now they have 87,613,142 shares, a difference of 10,990,000 shares. The media is incorrectly reporting only 820,500 were sold.

Overall, I am expecting that they had a great quarter with a record amount of operating earnings. It will be the 2nd quarter in row above $10 billion. Insurance underwriting, insurance investment income, and utilities and energy should be strong. Railroad income will be lower due to industry wide slowdown and higher costs.

2023-10-30 12:16:14,r/BerkshireHathaway,Berkshire Hathaway Dives into Diageo,"Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate led by Warren Buffett, has added Diageo plc to its ever-expanding portfolio. Diageo, a renowned liquor purveyor, boasts a vast array of over 200 brands, with a global presence in more than 180 countries.

In a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Berkshire disclosed its acquisition of 227,750 shares of Diageo. This investment represents a relatively modest 0.04% ownership stake in the company, but it signifies Berkshire’s interest in the liquor giant.

Diageo, a name synonymous with top-quality beverages, offers a stellar lineup of best-selling brands, including the iconic Johnnie Walker Scotch whisky, Tanqueray gin, Smirnoff vodka, Guinness stout, and Baileys cream liqueur. These brands have long been favorites among consumers and have played a significant role in establishing Diageo as a leading player in the spirits industry.

Notably, Diageo has set ambitious goals for the future. Currently holding a 4.7% share of the global Total Beverage Alcohol (TBA) market, the company has its sights set on increasing that value share to an impressive 6% by the year 2030. This aspiration reflects Diageo’s commitment to growth and innovation within the dynamic world of beverages.

Moreover, Diageo recently announced a share buy-back program, demonstrating their dedication to creating value for their shareholders. This program aims to return up to $1.0 billion of capital to investors and is scheduled to be completed before June 26, 2024. The buy-back follows the successful completion of Diageo’s return of capital program during the second half of fiscal 2023, in which £0.5 billion of capital was returned to shareholders.

The tentative agreement, which was announced on September 28, follows up on the mandatory local bargaining items from last year’s Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) and goes well beyond.

This breakthrough tentative agreement comes after several months of negotiations, and pending ratification by SMART-TD’s members at BNSF, it is expected to bring positive changes to both the professional and personal lives of these employees.

The agreement will allow for more predictable scheduling (with rest days available to all pool and extra board employees) and enables all ground service employees to take paid sick days, with many additional quality of work/life changes. These enhancements will not only benefit current employees, but they will also contribute to more consistent service for BNSF’s customers, and aid in the recruitment and retention of employees.

The agreement extends NetJets’ existing fleet agreement, and includes options for an increasing number of aircraft each year, enabling NetJets to expand its fleet with Cessna Citation Ascend, Citation Latitude and Citation Longitude aircraft. Equally exciting is the announcement that NetJets has been named the fleet launch customer for Textron Aviation’s newest jet — the Citation Ascend. Deliveries of the Citation Ascend are expected to begin in 2025 when the aircraft, currently under development, is expected to enter into service.

“NetJets customers around the world continually select Citations as their aircraft of choice. We’re honored to be the largest provider of industry-leading aircraft to NetJets and look forward to continuing to work together to design and deliver the best aviation experience based on customer feedback,” said Ron Draper, president and CEO, Textron Aviation. “Expanding and adding the Citation Ascend to the NetJets fleet will provide its global customers with even more versatility and flexibility to accomplish their missions, building upon the exceptional performance and popularity of the Latitude and Longitude.”

Since the inception of the more than 40-year relationship between the companies, NetJets has taken delivery of more than 800 aircraft from Textron Aviation, including exercising over 300 options for Citation Latitudes and Longitudes during the past eight years. This enduring relationship equips discerning customers with class-leading, safe, and reliable aviation travel experiences worldwide. Through the years, NetJets has owned and operated industry-leading Citations including the Citation SII, V, Excel/XLS, Sovereign, X, Latitude and Longitude models.

“As a long-time, trusted ally who shares our commitment to safety and service, Textron Aviation is the ideal partner to help us expand our offerings to NetJets Owners with the introduction of the new Ascend to our midsize jet class, as well as by growing our overall fleet,” said Doug Henneberry, NetJets Executive Vice President, Aircraft Asset Management. “Based on past demand for the popular Citation Latitude and Longitude, the new Ascend and all our new Citations will undoubtedly be well received by our Owners, particularly those who depend on NetJets to help them do more and miss less.”

2023-08-17 19:51:14,r/BerkshireHathaway,Occidental Makes $1.1 Billion Acquisition of Carbon Engineering Ltd.,"Just days after Occidental Petroleum subsidiary 1PointFive was awarded a portion of a $1.2 billion grant from the Biden administration for its commercial-scale direct air capture facilities in Texas, the Berkshire Hathaway-backed company has announced that the wholly owned subsidiary has entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire all the outstanding equity of Carbon Engineering Ltd.

The acquisition is for total cash consideration of approximately $1.1 billion, to be made in three approximately equivalent annual payments, with the first at closing.

This transaction is expected to close before the end of 2023, subject to Canadian court reviews, Canadian and U.S. regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.

Occidental has been working with Carbon Engineering on direct air capture (DAC) deployment since 2019. Acquiring Carbon Engineering aligns with Occidental’s integrated net-zero strategy and provides Occidental, through its 1PointFive subsidiary, the opportunity to rapidly advance DAC technology breakthroughs and accelerate deployment of DAC as a large-scale, cost effective, global carbon removal solution. Carbon Engineering’s DAC-based climate solutions utilize standardized processes and proven industrial equipment.

“We expect the acquisition of Carbon Engineering to deliver our shareholders value through an improved drive for technology innovation and accelerated DAC cost reductions. The technology partnership also adds new revenue streams in the form of technology licensing and royalties. Importantly, the acquisition enables Occidental to catalyze broader development partnerships for DAC deployment in the most capital efficient and valuable way,” said Occidental President and CEO Vicki Hollub.

“We look forward to continuing our collaboration with the Carbon Engineering team, which has been a leader in pioneering and advancing DAC technology,” Hollub said. “Together, Occidental and Carbon Engineering can accelerate plans to globally deploy DAC technology at a climate-relevant scale and make DAC the preferred solution for businesses seeking to remove their hard-to-abate emissions.”

Upon closing, Carbon Engineering would become a wholly owned subsidiary of Oxy Low Carbon Ventures. Carbon Engineering’s personnel will continue to drive ongoing DAC technology development efforts and work closely with the Occidental and 1PointFive teams to bring DAC solutions to market. Carbon Engineering’s research and development activities and Innovation Center will remain in Squamish, British Columbia.

Story by Yun Li

Every so often, a hot new investor on the rise is crowned ""the next Warren Buffett"" by the financial media, followed swiftly by disappointing performance that proves they're no ""Oracle of Omaha."" Sam Bankman-Fried, now facing criminal charges, is an extreme case.

But even beyond the disgraced founder of of the FTX crypto exchange, others have suffered the curse of being lauded as The Next Buffett. Pershing Square's Bill Ackman, former Sear's CEO Eddie Lampert, Social Capital's Chamath Palihapitiya were all called ""the next Warren Buffett"" at one stage or another of their careers, but none of their track records comes close to matching the 92-year-old investing legend.

By now, investors can stop looking. ""The next Warren Buffett"" remains Warren Buffett alone.

Since taking control of Berkshire Hathaway in 1965, Buffett has proven himself sui generis — one of a kind, unique, in a class by himself.

What makes Buffett so hard to duplicate? His $800 billion Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate claims to have doubled the average annual return of the S&amp;P 500 since Buffett led an investment group that first acquired a majority of Berkshire back in the LBJ years.

Today, Berkshire owns an incredible array of diverse businesses, ranging from its crown jewel GEICO insurance to BNSF Railway, from almost 6% of Apple to 100% of Dairy Queen, with lots more besides. Its balance sheet is unmatched, swelling with about $150 billion in cash. That makes Buffett, famously a student of Columbia University's legendary value investing professor Ben Graham, the most venerated investor of his, or succeeding, generations.

""Berkshire's economic moat is more than just a sum of its parts,"" said Greggory Warren, Berkshire analyst at Morningstar. That is because of Buffett's success at ""melding the firm's financial strength and underwriting ability with his own investment acumen,"" he said.

In the midst of the Go-Go stock market of the 1960s, Buffett used an investment partnership he ran to buy what was then a struggling New England textile company. Today, Berkshire is unrecognizable from what it once was, and more successful than ever. The stock hit an all-time high just this week after Berkshire posted a record operating profit of more than $10 billion in the three months ended in June, boosted by a rebound in insurance operations.

The numbers speak for themselves. Berkshire shares have generated a 19.8% annualized gain from 1965 through 2022, doubling the 9.9% return of the S&amp;P 500. Cumulatively, the stock has gone up 3,787,464% since Buffett took over.

Whitney Tilson, CEO of Empire Financial Research and a Berkshire shareholder, has been calling Berkshire shares ""America's No.1 retirement stock"" for years.

""It offers a unique combination of safety, growth, and undervaluation,"" Tilson said, who has been attending Berkshire's annual shareholder meetings in Nebraska for over two decades. ""The stock should be the bedrock of any conservative portfolio.""

Buffett has always focused on owning large amounts of cash, comparing it to oxygen — a resource that can be deployed quickly when needed, or opportunities present themselves. He has said that large cash holdings are necessary as a duty to shareholders, because Berkshire insures people, and because he likes to retain his independence during times of turmoil.

""Many, many people ... have staked their wellbeing on the promises of Berkshire to take care of them for, like I say, 50 years or longer into the future,"" Buffett said during Berkshire's 2020 annual meeting. ""We always operate from a position of strength....We don't want to be dependent on the kindness of strangers, friends, even, because there are times when money almost stops.""

The mountain of cash at Berkshire has enabled Buffett to act fast during a crisis. In 2011, Buffett injected $5 billion into beleaguered Bank of America in a major show of faith. He famously came to Goldman Sachs' rescue with a $5 billion cash infusion after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. In 1987, he saved Salomon Brothers from a hostile takover.

""Berkshire retained and expanded the cash hoard on its Fort Knox balance sheet, allowing the unique ability to take advantage of opportunities in any downturn while virtually eliminating the risk of ruin,"" said Bill Stone, chief investment officer at Glenview Trust and a Berkshire shareholder. 

'The GOAT'

Palihapitiya recently expressed his admiration, calling Buffett ""the greatest of all time"" after analyzing his latest bet on Japan.

The technology investor said the five Japanese trading houses Buffett invested in are good investments because they pay stable dividends and boost their earnings, at the same time as Buffett was able to hedge currency risk by selling Japanese debt, pocketing the difference between dividends collected on the investments and bond coupon payments Berkshire pays out.

""It's inspiring to see folks act this intelligently at scale,"" said Palihapitiya who, at his peak, once compared his own return with Berkshire's.

Many Buffett watchers have marveled at the investor's pivot to investing in Apple, which has ballooned to a $177 billion bet, the single largest holding in Berkshire's equity portfolio.

Although Buffett has famously avoided tech stocks, and Apple is far from Buffett's field of expertise and comfort level, he likens the iPhone maker to a consumer products company and has said he is also attracted to its big buyback programs. Apple authorized the repurchase of as much as $90 billion of common stock in both 2022 and again in 2023.

Buffett's Apple bet has made Berkshire well over $100 billion since 2016.

Wheels Up has given notice to the Securities and Exchange Commission that “there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for any meaningful period of time.”

Wheels Up recently received a cash infusion from its 20% equity partner Delta Air Lines, but that looks to be insufficient to sustain the company long term.

Wheels Up is third behind NetJets and Flexjet in the private aviation market.

Wheels Up also signed a non-binding letter of intent sell its aircraft management business to Airshare, which is currently ninth in the private aviation market.

(Bloomberg) -- Occidental Petroleum Corp. bought back $522 million of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s preferred stock in the second quarter, demonstrating its willingness to repay Warren Buffett even as commodity prices drop.

The purchase brings Occidental’s redemptions this year to 12% of Berkshire’s initial $10 billion investment, which was used to fund the producer’s acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corp. in 2019. Berkshire’s preferred stock carries an 8% annual dividend, making it an expensive part of Occidental’s capital structure.

Separately, Berkshire owns 25% of Occidental’s common stock and is the company’s largest shareholder, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Berkshire is willing to buy more Occidental common stock, Buffett said at its shareholder meeting in Omaha earlier this year. However, he ruled out buying the oil producer in its entirety.

Occidental shares dropped as much as 2.7% in after-market trading as the company missed analysts’ earnings estimates because of weaker realized prices for its gas production. The company raised its 2023 production guidance 1.3%, but also reported higher capital spending than expected.",12,0,[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/BerkshireHathaway/comments/15gqe7a/occidental_buys_back_522_million_of_berkshire/,15gqe7a

Berkshire’s largest equity position is Apple and I believe is also the largest shareholder. Apple made the deal for ten years of MLS rights and soon after, Messi signed with Inter Miami. And now Geico seems to have upped its sponsorship and advertising considerably on the side boards and commercials. Last year I don’t remember seeing much of Geico, it was RBC that probably advertised the most. 

Is this a coincidence or is there some Berkshire involvement here?

The other thing I noticed is Berkshire’s intertwinement with Terrence Crawford and his career. Looking at past fights Geico seems to be a big sponsor as well. In case you don’t know, Crawford is a very proud Omaha native and now maybe its biggest star. Similar to Messi 🤣 Paramount is an equity position of BH and BH is Paramount’s largest shareholder. Paramount’s Showtime sold and broadcasted Terrence Crawford’s fight against Errol Spence in which Crawford earned the title of the best boxer pound for pound. 

So my question is what to learn about these seeming coincidences? Warren has said that streaming and probably sports are not the best businesses but what’s going on here?

The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate disclosed a 1.9% stake in Activision with 14,658,121 shares, a new 13G filing released Monday evening showed. That compared with a 6.3% stake at the end of March and a 6.7% stake at the end of 2022.

Shares of Activision soared more than 9% last week on news that the Federal Trade Commission lost its bid to block Microsoft’s $68.7 billion acquisition of the video game publisher. Microsoft’s appeal against U.K. regulators’ block on Monday was granted a two-month pause.

The stock closed Monday at $93.21 apiece. In January 2022, Microsoft announced intentions to buy Activision for $95 per share.

The “Oracle of Omaha” previously revealed that one of his investing lieutenants, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, first took a stake in Activision in October and November 2021 with an average cost of $77 per share.

The 92-year-old investing legend has since added to the holding in a merger arbitrage play, betting that Microsoft’s proposed acquisition of the video game company would close.

Buffett revealed that he and his longtime business partner Charlie Munger started doing merger arbitrage deals five decades ago, back when it was called “workouts.”",8,1,[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/BerkshireHathaway/comments/152fl0t/warren_buffetts_berkshire_hathaway_cuts/,152fl0t

Story by [mfox@businessinsider.com](mailto:mfox@businessinsider.com) (Matthew Fox) • 13m ago

Activision Blizzard stock surged more than 10% on Tuesday to just a couple dollars below its $95 buyout price.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owned nearly 50 million shares of Activision at the end of the first quarter.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is poised to score a more than $1 billion profit in its Activision Blizzard stake after Microsoft prevailed against the FTC on Tuesday in its bid to acquire the video game company.

That's assuming that Berkshire Hathaway held onto its stake in Activision Blizzard and didn't sell any shares since it reported owning a $4.2 billion position in the company at the end of the first quarter.

Berkshire Hathaway first purchased a stake in Activision Blizzard in the fourth quarter of 2021, just a few months before Microsoft announced its proposed acquisition of Activision. The position was initiated by one of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio managers, either Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, according to Buffett.

Berkshire Hathaway's first Activision purchase was about 14.6 million shares at an average price of about $77 or $78 per share, Buffett said in a February 2022 letter.

But the stake soon became a merger arbitrage position following Microsoft's announced deal for Activision. And Berkshire Hathaway — at the direction of Buffett himself — increased its position in the company by 49.7 million shares in the first quarter of 2022 at an average estimated price of $72.96 per share, according to data from WhaleWisdom. 

""Every now and then I see something that I want to do in that field \[merger arbitrage\],"" Buffett said at Berkshire Hathaway's 2022 annual shareholder meeting. ""It is my purchase, not the manager who bought it some months ago. If the deal goes through, we make some money.""

Berkshire Hathaway ultimately built its Activision stake to a peak of 68.4 million shares in the second quarter of 2022 at an estimated weighted average price of $73.95 per share, Insider calculated. Since then, the conglomerate pared down its position in the third, fourth, and first quarters of 2022 and 2023, respectively, to 49.7 million shares.

If Microsoft is able to close its deal for Microsoft at its all-cash offer of $95 per share, which sources tell CNBC's David Faber could happen as soon as next week, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway would see a profit windfall of just over $1 billion based on its stake reported at the end of the first quarter and its estimated weighted average price paid for the stock.

Shares of Activision soared as much as 12% on Tuesday to about $92 per share following news that the court blocked the FTC's bid to stop the deal. The stock is still about $3 away from its buyout price of $95 per share.

2023-07-11 12:26:28,r/BerkshireHathaway,Berkshire Hathaway Purchases Dominion Energy’s Stake in Cove Point LNG,"Berkshire Hathaway Energy has successfully executed an agreement to acquire Dominion Energy’s 50% limited partnership stake in the Cove Point LNG, LP business.

Pending regulatory approvals, the purchased interest will be held under the umbrella of BHE GT&amp;S, LLC, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. A subsidiary of BHE GT&amp;S already serves as the general partner and operator of the Cove Point natural gas pipeline and its liquefied natural gas terminal, both situated in Lusby, Maryland.

With a transaction value of $3.3 billion, the deal will primarily be funded through the utilization of existing cash reserves, including proceeds from the liquidation of specific investments. Once the transaction is finalized, Berkshire Hathaway Energy will bolster its ownership by securing a 75% limited partnership stake in Cove Point LNG, LP. It is worth noting that the remaining 25% limited partnership interest in Cove Point LNG, LP will be retained by a subsidiary of Brookfield Infrastructure Partners.

Paul Ruppert, the president of BHE GT&amp;S, expressed his pride in the operations conducted at Cove Point and shared his excitement regarding this new opportunity to enhance their ownership in these globally renowned facilities. He emphasized that the dedicated Cove Point team would continue to prioritize providing secure, affordable, and dependable service to their esteemed customers.

Located on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay, the facility is the first such facility on the East Coast. It is recognized as one of the most technically advanced and environmentally sensitive LNG facilities in the world, and has a storage capacity of 14.6 billion cubic feet (BCF) and a daily send-out capacity of 1.8 BCF.

Cove Point produces LNG under 20-year contracts for ST Cove Point, a joint venture of Sumitomo Corporation and Tokyo Gas, and for Gail Global (USA) LNG, the U.S. affiliate of GAIL (India) LTD.

Since the facility first entered commercial service in April 2018 for natural gas liquefaction and export, LNG produced from the facility has supported the energy needs of 28 countries, including many in Europe in recent months. And Cove Point LNG loaded its 300th commercial cargo at the end of July.

With this strategic move, Berkshire Hathaway Energy continues to expand its portfolio of world-class assets. This acquisition not only aligns with the company’s long-term growth strategy but also reinforces its position as a prominent player in the ever-evolving energy sector.

There are people, very few, worth paying up a bit to get in with for a longer term advantage.”*  

What do you think is the reasoning behind his belief that there are cases in which it would be a **good idea to pay a price above intrinsic value** considering that this one is the present value of all future cash flows of a business? Could it be about the expectation for positive surprises that can’t be incorporated into his intrinsic value estimation but would make a future intrinsic value estimate significantly higher (such as AWS wasn’t a thing at a point in time for Amazon)?",2,0,fuufufufuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BerkshireHathaway/comments/14wf1ob/munger_on_paying_a_price_above_intrinsic_value/,14wf1ob
2023-07-01 20:04:05,r/stocks,How important is BRK-B not having a dividend in terms of capital appreciation without getting taxed?,"The more I look into BRK-B (forget A given the price) , the more I appreciate the high quality businesses invested private/public, international exposure, and a few high growth buys like NU Holdings. 

Doing full S&amp;P with getting taxed on the dividends can chip away over time I suppose. BRK does fairly routine buy backs and sitting on a ton of cash. My thoughts are if BRK drops after Warren or Charlie's passing, the probable sell off is going to be met with what I imagine STRONG buy backs at discounted deep value prices with that cash hoard they're sitting on. 

BRK.B over 20+ years with DRIP beats S&amp;P, but not QQQ. Although I do like BRK's Apple exposure, along with AMEX, banks, etc. 

Overall I think it is a great play (at least in my taxable individual account) given NO dividends, ability for buybacks at deep value.

# [Dow futures rise slightly to start the week as banks gain, investors look ahead to inflation data: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/07/stock-futures-are-flat-to-start-the-week.html)
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose slightly Monday as bank shares climbed, and investors looked ahead to a key inflation data release later in the week.
*****
&gt; Dow futures were up 78 points, or 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.2%. Nasdaq-100 futures were flat.
*****
&gt; Regional bank stocks rose broadly in the premarket, with the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) climbing 2.6%. Shares of PacWest outperformed, surging 31%, after the bank cut its dividend. Big banks Citigroup, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley also rose.
*****
&gt; On the inflation front, investor attention this week turns to April’s consumer price index due out Wednesday, followed by the producer price index on Thursday.
*****
&gt; Both reports “could help analysts decipher the direction of the more stubborn crevices of the economy where inflation remains sticky,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial.
*****
&gt; Following last week’s rate decision from the Federal Reserve, traders are pricing in just a 9% chance for a hike at the central bank’s next policy meeting, according to CME’s FedWatch tool.
*****
&gt; “Financial markets are hoping that it continues to remain subdued, but only if inflation cooperates,” Krosby said.
*****
&gt; Stocks are coming off a volatile week that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 notch their worst weekly stretches since March. The losses came despite a late-week rally that saw volatile regional bank stocks jump off their lows.
*****
&gt; Over the weekend, billionaire investor Warren Buffett commented on a slew of topics, including the latest banking crisis that rocked Wall Street, at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. The latest results from the conglomerate showed operating earnings increase 12% in the first quarter, while its cash hoard topped $130 billion.
*****
&gt; Despite recent fears, Buffett said deposits should be safe in the banking sector, while also noting that commercial real estate is beginning to experience the consequences of higher borrowing costs. Even with its more than 20% stake in Occidental Petroleum, Buffett also indicated that Berkshire has no plans to take over the oil giant.

I will try to keep this brief, but would really love to have some conversations with others about my allocation because I keep thinking myself in circles.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently my portfolio is:   


* Spy/Voo: 47% 
* VXUS: 15% 
* Target Date - 2055: 7%
* SCHD:  5%
* QQQ:  1%
* Individual Stocks:  23% (3% Appl, 3% MSFT, 3% CRM, 3% ABBV, 2% Cost, 2% UNH, 2% JPM, 2% BRK.B, 2% WMT)

&amp;#x200B;

I have been targeting a portfolio that will have roughly: 

* SPY: 40%
* Target Date: 30% 
* VXUS: 10%
* ???: 15% 
* Individual Stocks: 5%

&amp;#x200B;

(Context, the VXUS will go down as my 401k invests into target date fund which is already 1/3 VXUS but I will use my personal brokerage to help rebalance as needed)

&amp;#x200B;

I have held most of the individual stocks for quite a few years, its how I got started investing. They have all done well, luckily to some degree and some due to not touching for a few years. 

I have gone back and forth researching, and thinking myself in circles. I have considered just selling my positions in Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, etc and buying QQQ to keep a large cap growth tilt but worry it is just chasing performance. 

I have considered heavily SCHD and AVUV; SCHD for the drip effect in my roth to let it accumulate tax free but just havent found a reason to have conviction given my timeline is 20-30 years. AVUV in theory sounds good, the short track record and the ability to stomach downturns of SCV at 10-15% of my portfolio is possible but there isnt a ton of data to back up the fund. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would love others thoughts and opinions on this, I have been in a mental pretzel for weeks thinking about this.",22,13,silenceisbetter1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12y39k6/how_to_best_allocate_final_15_of_my_porfolio/,12y39k6

# [Stock futures rise after major averages suffer biggest weekly losses of the year: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/26/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. equity futures rose Monday, as traders tried to recover some ground following the worst week of the year on Wall Street. Investors also looked ahead to another big week in retail earnings.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 138 points, or 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.5%, and Nasdaq-100 futures rose 0.6%.
*****
&gt; The major averages Friday ended the day lower and posted their biggest weekly declines for 2023. The Dow finished lower by 3%, its fourth down week in a row. The S&amp;P 500 lost 2.7% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.3% for the week.
*****
&gt; Stocks sank Friday and Treasury yields jumped following a bigger-than-expected increase in the latest reading for personal consumption expenditures, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge.
*****
&gt; The early 2023 rally seems to be fading as investors absorb the minutes of the latest Fed meeting, which reiterated the central bank’s tough stance on inflation, as well as recent comments from Fed officials cautioning interest rates could rise higher and for longer than anticipated.
*****
&gt; “As we head into a seasonally weak period, with bets rising that the Fed may go with a 50bps increase instead of a 25bps in March, though still a minority opinion, the short-term market risk remains to the downside despite three straight weeks of losses,” said Louis Navellier, chairman and founder of growth investing firm Navellier &amp; Associates. “The bears are dusting themselves off after getting sacked in January.”
*****
&gt; Concern over tighter monetary policy and persistent inflation have pushed Treasury yields higher. The 2-year rate on Monday hit its highest level since July 2007.
*****
&gt; In the week ahead, investors will be looking for clues about how inflation is affecting consumers and businesses amid a handful of economic data reports and corporate earnings. Durable goods orders are due out Monday morning. Consumer confidence and the ISM manufacturing survey are also on deck in the coming week.
*****
&gt; In earnings, just 6% of the S&amp;P 500 will report but investors are looking for insight into the consumer with several major retailers, restaurants, some travel and entertainment names as well as food companies set to report. Target, Costco, Lowe’s and Macy’s are some of the big names set to report earnings this week.

2023-02-25 14:29:28,r/stocks,"Berkshire operating earnings fall 8%, cash hoard swells to nearly $130 billion","https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/25/berkshire-hathaway-brk-earnings-q4-2022.html

Berkshire Hathaway’s operating profits fell during the fourth quarter as inflationary pressures weighed on the conglomerate’s businesses.

Berkshire Hathaway’s operating earnings totaled $6.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, a release read Saturday. That’s down 7.9% from the year-earlier period when profits totaled $7.285 billion. Operating earnings refers to the total profits made from the businesses owned by the conglomerate.

For the year, the conglomerate’s operating earnings totaled $30.793 billion. That’s up 12.2% from $27.455 billion in 2021.

Meanwhile, Berkshire used $2.855 billion to buy back shares in the fourth quarter. That’s lower than the year-earlier period when share repurchases totaled approximately $6.9 billion.

Given this, Berkshire’s cash hoard grew to $128.651 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022. That’s up from nearly $109 billion in the third quarter.

Buffett said in his annual shareholder letter that Berkshire will continue to hold a “boatload” of cash and U.S. Treasury bills along with its myriad of businesses. He specified that future CEOs in the company will use their own money to hold Berkshire shares.

“As for the future, Berkshire will always hold a boatload of cash and U.S. Treasury bills along with a wide array of businesses. We will also avoid behavior that could result in any uncomfortable cash needs at inconvenient times, including financial panics and unprecedented insurance losses,” Buffett wrote.

“And yes, our shareholders will continue to save and prosper by retaining earnings. At Berkshire, there will be no finish line.”

2023-01-21 20:53:40,r/stocks,Can your picks outperform hype? (Introducing the Over Priced Index),"So recently I asked everyone what the most overpriced stock was and I got plenty of different choices to pick from (post below). With this information, I introduce to you..... The Reddit's Over Priced Index!

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10esbx3/whats\_the\_most\_over\_priced\_stock/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10esbx3/whats_the_most_over_priced_stock/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Here's how it works. Every ticker was 1 vote for that company. Each vote takes up a portion of the portfolio so more votes for one company means that company will take up more space (EX. TSLA had 8 votes whereas SPCE had one so Tesla takes up 8 times as much space). Every vote counted - so even if I disagreed, I can't remove any votes. The votes are closed so sorry to all that didn't get the chance but not to worry because the portfolio will either be updated quarterly or semi-annually depending on how lazy I am.

The real 2 things we're trying to find out:

1. Are these stocks really driven by Hype and overpriced?
2. Can you out-preform the index? (check the future updates to see if you can!)

Without further ado, here are the holdings! (Ordered from most votes to least).

2022-12-17 04:21:30,r/stocks,Reflections of Poor Decisions in 2022,"As always, this in not financial advice. This is simply a public reflection of my thoughts on the year as it relates to my portfolio. Due your own due diligence and don’t trust the words of a random stranger on the internet.

This year I will likely end the year with a return -30% to -40%, currently down about 35%. As I have done (not on reddit) for several years now, I like to reflect on the quality of my decisions and the outcomes.

Entering 2022 I had the following holdings: GOOGL, AXP, BRKB, CHE, CHWY, CNSWF, DPZ, HIFS, LMND, MSFT, SPGI, SCI, TMX, TSLA, TOITF, U, YETI

During the year, I made the mistake of moving aggressively into beaten down low-quality tech. Names like U, LMND, PLTR, UPST, DDOG, OKTA, SHOP, TEAM, TOST. In terms of the quality of the decisions I would say that I was that I did not make complete well-rounded decisions. On one hand, I generally applaud myself for buying companies when they are out of favor. These names were down 40 to 60% at the time of purchase. Where I did not do well was look at more than factors other than torrid growth rate and a bright future fed to me on the beautiful pages embedded on their investor presentations (let’s look at that and avoid the skeletons in the 10-Q I said to myself). These companies were bought with too much sunshine and not enough rain.

I should have reviewed additional factors: 

First, how are the financials trending other than growth. Sure, revenue was going up gangbusters, what about margins, or dilution or capital requirements, Revenue/EE, Revenue/Sh etc. As I dug under the hood later in the year most of these companies made no advancement on margins despite torrid revenue growth. I realized not digging this far was very very stupid. 

Additionally, I realized throughout time the competitive landscape has changed and I need to update my assessment as well. Take DataDog. My belief about their competitive positioning was “due to the nature of their mission critical software companies are not likely to leave them due to the high switching costs.” One day I went over my portfolio holding by holding and I realized that I had virtually all software names that had an advantage in my view that stemmed from a switching cost. It kind of hit me this is ridiculous. How can every company have a switching cost advantage? The cloud changed everything. Without the need for servers, it is much easier to simply move from one company to another. Now of course there are still training costs and implementation costs to be sure, but the barriers to create software have never been lower and the number of options has never been higher. 

The realization that switching costs in my opinion is not stringent enough of a definition led me to investigate competitive advantages further. As I do often when I feel I have lost my way in investing, I revisit some legendary texts. This time, I revisited Terry Smith’s Owner’s Manual ([https://www.fundsmith.co.uk/media/mv3abv1h/owners-manual.pdf](https://www.fundsmith.co.uk/media/mv3abv1h/owners-manual.pdf)). In there, he has a section where he speaks about the types of companies they like. Here is what it said:

“We seek to invest in businesses whose assets are intangible and difficult to replicate

It may seem counter-intuitive to seek businesses which do not rely upon tangible assets, but bear with us. The businesses we seek to invest in do something very unusual: they break the rule of mean reversion that states returns must revert to the average as new capital is attracted to business activities earning super-normal returns.

They can do this because their most important assets are not physical assets, which can be replicated by anyone with access to capital, but intangible assets, which can be very difficult to replicate, no matter how much capital a competitor is willing to spend. Moreover, it’s hard for companies to replicate these intangible assets using borrowed funds, as banks tend to favor the (often illusory) comfort of tangible collateral. This means that the business does not suffer from economically irrational (or at least innumerate) competitors when credit is freely available.”

This section gave me an epiphany! To sum it up, businesses with competitive advantages are built in a way that capital alone is unable to reproduce. In other words, there has to be an intangible factor that capital is unable to recreate. I combined this idea with the other questions I typically ask myself.

· **Company Soundness**

o Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?

o Do they operate with significant leverage?

o Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?

· **Can it be Replicated?**

o Is their evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?

o Is their evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?

o What is the competitive advantage?

o Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?

o Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

· **Growth**

o Is their a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?

o Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?

· **Decision**

o Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision?

o Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?

Answering these questions brought down a watchlist of \~75 names to 26.

This filter took names like Amazon off my list. In my opinion, Amazon derives most of its advantage from a long recurring investment in capital. Distribution centers for their retail business and data centers for AWS. Over time as firms have invested in DTC, this has marginalized much of Amazon’s advantage. Additionally, as more cloud players come into the space, the investment in data centers is becoming more common. Ironically, my opinion on Amazon is add odds with Terry Smith given his position in Amazon. As they say, that is what makes a market. Just pull up annual return on assets and you will see one of the reasons why Amazon is plummeting.

Below is my refined list of 26 companies and why I feel capital alone will be able to replicate them sorted alphabetically by name.

Company Ticker Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

Airbnb, Inc. ABNB Network Effect for Airbnb's. Customers want to shop for Airbnb's where the hosts are. Host want to list where the customers are. 

American Express Company AXP Network effect, to upset V you would need to sign up both consumers and vendors all while offering incentives from a significantly smaller scale.

Apple Inc. AAPL Network effects. App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want phones where they can access the services they customarily use. The Duopoly has been attacked by Microsoft and Amazon, yet we still only have two phone systems.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B Reputation. BRK's reputation has a financial powerhouse makes its insurance division one of the few insurers that can be trusted with large and complex risks. Additionally, management unique operating structure allows for very little conglomerate penalty due to the individual management of many businesses.

As one threat is dealt with, the solutions are synced through the rest of their cloud-based service. This means helping one client helps all and the more customers the strong the service.

Fair Isaac Corporation FICO Regulatory Entrenchment and track record. The FICO score is synonymous with personal lending. Often it is a key determinant for determining loan eligibility.

Hingham Institution for Savings HIFS Culture of Discipline. There are many banks in this world, virtually none of them are as efficient as HIFS. Their disciplined culture toward underwriting leads to lower than industry average charge offs annually while their focus on costs leads to above industry profitability. If you could re-create this with capital, banks with more scale would have similar returns.

IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. IDXX Trade Secrets. IDXX offers many proprietary tests for vets. This means that only IDXX labs can process them. Additionally, many vets are trained on their tests meaning switching would result in the need for new training.

Lemonade, Inc. LMND Potential to be low-Cost provider and culture of customer care. By offering insurance DTC, Lemonade can avoid many entrenched costs from agency model. Additionally, by getting Guinness World Records for fastest claim paid and removing the frustrating part of insurance which is using it, they have the potential to earn pricing power over time

RLI Corp. RLI Disciplined Underwriting culture and unique track record. Their underwriting culture had led to a 10 BPs lower combined ratio and lower ratio every year for the last decade.

Roper Technologies, Inc. ROP Decentralized operating culture focused on end markets that benefit from efficient scale.

S&amp;P Global Inc. SPGI Regulatory Entrenchment and Track Record. S&amp;Ps credit rating are required by many contracts and regulations for many debt deals.

Smaller player and late entries like BigCommerce have struggled to gain traction

Tesla, Inc. TSLA Network effect, Brand, Unique Operating Culture in a tough industry. Network effects stem from outsized number of cars on road all outfitted with self-driving equipment giving Tesla more data to develop self-driving cars giving them a data advantage for developing self-driving cars. Additionally, Tesla is the undisputed electric vehicle king given their first mover advantage. Finally, they operate differently than most of their competitors. They build the important and unique components in house whereas legacy auto tends to outsource all parts and simply assemble them. They sell DTC at retail prices whereas legacy auto sell wholesale to dealers. They have a standard labor force whereas most of legacy auto has unionized labor which is trained on legacy ICE engines. The auto industry is historically difficult to enter as it requires large amounts of capital, high fixed costs with a cyclical product.

Vail Resorts, Inc. MTN You can't re-create the limited supply of mountains in the world. There are so many mountains and locations with the proper weather conditions to enable skiing. This gives them pricing power, particularly when you account for how many mountains they own in many regions.

VeriSign, Inc. VRSN Government granted monopoly. All .com and .net domains must be registered with VRSN. Additionally, price increases are regulated. Fortunately, ROCs are not

Visa Inc. V Network effect, to upset V you would need to sign up both consumers and vendors all while offering incentives from a significantly smaller scale.

From there I reviewed the 26 companies by valuation and felt 15 of them are compelling investments at this time:

Company Ticker Target

Visa Inc. V 10.00%

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B 10.00%

Blackstone Inc. BX 8.00%

American Express Company AXP 8.00%

Salesforce, Inc. CRM 8.00%

Constellation Software Inc. CNSW.F  8.00%

Hingham Institution for Savings HIFS 6.00%

Tesla, Inc. TSLA 6.00%

VeriSign, Inc. VRSN 6.00%

Lemonade, Inc. LMND 5.00%

Nu Holdings Ltd. NU 5.00%

Airbnb, Inc. ABNB 5.00%

Vail Resorts, Inc. MTN 5.00%

Shopify Inc. SHOP 5.00%

CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD 5.00%

I feel much more confident in the portfolio after re-reviewing the soundness, ability to be replicated, future growth prospects. They key for future years is to avoid laziness when analyzing names. It is foolhardy and expensive to fall in love with an investor presentation and then go and buy it on hopes and dreams rather than seeing the larger picture.

The ironic thing is I have owned 14 of the 15 at some point in my life. For one reason or another I got shaken out of them and bought into the temptress that goes by the name of high growth. Like most temptresses, more research reveals not much substance.

For next steps, I will work on integrating the above process into my stock review routine and stick to it. I find that the hardest part with investing is simply sticking to a practical approach. Its too easy to waver to something new. Variety is the spice of life, but makes for the taste of cocoa powder in investments.

Obviously, these are just my opinions. I welcome your feedback.",37,13,rifleman209,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/znww2s/reflections_of_poor_decisions_in_2022/,znww2s

# [Stock futures fall after Wednesday’s big market rally](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/28/stock-market-news-open-to-close-futures-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures slumped Thursday, putting the major averages on track to give back some of the sharp gains seen in the previous session.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones dropped 181 points, or 0.7%, while S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 0.8% and 1.1%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The moves followed a broad rally for stocks a day earlier, as the Bank of England said it would purchase bonds in an effort to help steady its financial markets and the cratering British pound. Sterling has stooped to record lows against the U.S. dollar in recent days.
*****
&gt; It marked a stark shift from the aggressive tightening campaign many global central banks have undertaken to cope with surging inflation.
*****
&gt; The Dow on Wednesday gained or 1.9%, while the S&amp;P 500 rose nearly 2% after hitting a new bear market low on Tuesday. Both indexes snapped six-day losing streaks.
*****
&gt; As stocks rose and the BOE shared its bond-buying plan, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note dropped the most since 2020 after briefly topping 4%.
*****
&gt; “We are skeptical that the calmer mood in markets on Wednesday marks an end to the recent period of elevated volatility or risk-off sentiment. For a more sustained rally, investors will need to see convincing evidence that inflation is coming under control, allowing central banks to become less hawkish,” UBS’ Mark Haefele wrote in a Thursday note.
*****
&gt; Wednesday’s rally put the major averages on pace to eke out small gains for the week, but they are still on track to cap off their worst month since June. The Nasdaq Composite is leading the monthly losses, down about 6.5%, while the Dow and S&amp;P are on pace to close 5.8% and 5.9% lower, respectively.
*****
&gt; On a quarterly basis, the Nasdaq is on track to break a two-quarter losing streak, while the Dow is headed for its third consecutive quarterly loss for the first time since the third quarter of 2015. The S&amp;P is on pace for its third negative quarter in a row for the first time since its six-quarter negative streak that ended the first quarter of 2009.

At the start of this year I had some expenses so I held off investing and I'm only now starting to invest for current year I also have emergency cash reserves for around 6 months of expenses.

So I'm now 70/30 stocks/cash. I would prefer to hold with investing in stocks at the moment but I also don't like keeping cash in Euros as they are loosing to USD and CHF.

My portfolio is fine, I'm outperforming SP500 and because of low Euro all my stocks are above purchase price. Not selling anything since only get progressive tax advantage after holding for 5-15 years

So what should I do with the cash?

Invest in low beta dividend stocks (CVX, XOM, BRK)?

Exchange Euros into USD or CHF?

2022-08-31 08:56:06,r/stocks,Warren Buffett’s company trims its stake in Chinese EV maker BYD...,"Warren Buffett’s has company trimmed its stake in Chinese electric car and battery maker BYD for the first time since it bought the shares in 2008, an investment that has soared in value. Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B, -0.71% BRK.A, -0.83% said in a regulatory filing Tuesday with the Hong Kong stock exchange that it had sold 1.33 million of its BYD shares for roughly $47 million ($368.8 million Hong Kong dollars). Berkshire paid $232 million for the 225 million BYD shares it bought in 2008. By the end of last year, the value of those shares had ballooned to nearly $7.7 billion. The success of the BYD investment is one example of why so many investors follow Buffett’s moves closely because he has a remarkably successful track record over the decades. BYD said in an earnings report this week that sales of its vehicles continued to climb in the first half of this year and help it increase market share, even as auto sales slowed in its home market of China. BYD said its revenue jumped nearly 66% in the first half of this year thanks to the rapid growth in its electric vehicle sales, and its net income more than tripled to $520 million (3.6 billion yuan).

Berkshire said it owned about 7.7% of BYD before the latest stock sales, and that figure won’t change much after the sales. Berkshire said its holdings of the Hong Kong-issued shares of BYD dipped slightly from 20.49% to 19.92%. In the past, Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger have heaped praise on BYD Chairman and founder Wang Chanfu and said they were investing in him even more than in BYD’s technology. Munger has said that Wang managed to accomplish several feats that seemed impossible at the time, including taking one-third of the lithium battery market away from Japanese manufacturers by 2010.

Buffett even took the rare step of visiting a BYD factory in China in 2010 to demonstrate his support for the company. Hdidn’t immediately respond Tuesday to questions about the BYD stock sale. Besides investments, Buffett’s Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns more than 90 companies outright including Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an eclectic assortment of retail and manufacturing companies such as Dairy Queen, Helzberg Diamonds and Precision Castparts.

2022-08-22 14:53:22,r/stocks,When to sell OXY?,"One of the few good decisions I made recently is buying the same stocks Berkshire owns. OXY is by now up 23% in just a few months. 

However, there are rumors of Warren Buffet wanting to acquire the whole company. Squeeze out limits in the US are low (&gt;50%), so that makes it highly likely that he swallows it. Both holding on to it and selling for a favorable price is good for me. I just want to understand what I am up against.

So when is generally a good time to sell with an impending acquisition? What are the risks for waiting until a tender offer is made, what are the risks of not taking the offer? What are possible opportunity costs for selling now?

Are there risks in being a small minority stakeholder when BRK controls the majority? Are there specific thresholds I have to watch?",82,31,joe-re,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/wusuyc/when_to_sell_oxy/,wusuyc

Now don’t worry and sell out. According to general accounting rules Berkshire Hathaway must report gains/losses on their stocks even if they haven’t bought or sold stocks. 

This is kind of a service announcement because I remember someone saying there’s going to be a recession because of Berkshires massive loss. Obviously that statement is not true, it’s just looking at the market the past 3 months.

Using Reddit to buy and sell stocks is a very bad idea. PLEASE do more DD after a Reddit post. There are SEC filings for a reason.

*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures fell on Tuesday after another chipmaker warned about tough times ahead following Nvidia’s poor forecast in the prior session.
*****
&gt; Losses were contained as investors awaited inflation data this week that will determine the pace of future interest rate hikes.
*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures lost 0.2% as chip shares declined in the premarket. Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.6%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were little changed.
*****
&gt; Memory chipmaker Micron warned that revenue may fall short of its prior guidance because of ’macroeconomic factors and supply chain constraints.” The stock fell nearly 4% in early trading.
*****
&gt; It’s been a rough week for chipmakers. On Monday, weaker-than-expected revenue guidance from Nvidia weighed on the group. Nvidia was lower again in premarket trading Tuesday, shedding another 3% after a 6% decline on Monday. The iShares Semiconductor ETF lost 1.5% in premarket trading Tuesday after falling 1.5% on Monday.
*****
&gt; During Monday’s regular trading, the S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.12% and the Nasdaq Composite ticked down by 0.1%. Stocks had opened the session higher, but then gave up most of those gains before Monday’s closing bell.
*****
&gt; Outside of chips, a pair of Nasdaq-listed stocks were also taking early hits. Novavax slumped 32% in premarket trading after slashing full-year revenue guidance because of poor demand for its Covid vaccines. Upstart declined 13% in premarket trading after the consumer lending company reported second quarter results that missed both profit and revenue expectations.
*****
&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 coming off its third consecutive positive week, investors are wondering if this comeback is just a bear market bounce are the start of a new sustained advance.
*****
&gt; “I think a retest is likely and investors need to be careful about buying in here,” Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s Jim Lacamp said Monday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.” “You should use a rally like this to sell some stuff that you’re trying to get rid of — you know, you don’t want the cheese anymore, you want out of the trap.”
*****
&gt; On the economic front, investors are awaiting the latest reading of the July consumer price index, due Wednesday, to find some clarity on the path of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve as it works to stamp out inflation, or at least slow it.

# [Stock futures gain as market attempts to keep rebound from lows going, Morgan Stanley rises](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/27/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose early on Tuesday following a losing day as the market attempted to keep its rebound from the bear-market lows going.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 208 points or 0.7%. S&amp;P 500 futures edged up 0.6% and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.5%.
*****
&gt; The overnight action followed modest losses on Wall Street as a comeback rally stalled. The blue-chip Dow fell about 60 points, while the broader benchmark, the S&amp;P 500, dipped 0.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 0.7% on Monday. The major averages rallied last week, posting their first positive week since May as major averages rallied off their lows for the year. The S&amp;P 500 is still down 18% on the year but is up more than 7% from its low hit in mid-June.
*****
&gt; “One of the trickier calls in this business is evaluating the difference between a bounce in a bear market vs. the start of a more durable advance,” wrote Chris Verrone, technical analyst with Strategas. “The current bounce, +8% over the last 4 trading days, has been impressive on the surface as most moves of this context tend to be, but again has yet to signal any resounding internal or leadership improvement.”
*****
&gt; On Tuesday China relaxed its Covid restrictions for inbound travelers, cutting their quarantine time upon arrival by half to seven days. That gave travel and casino stocks a lift in premarket trading. Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands rose more than 6% each. American, United and Delta Air Lines all added more than 1%.
*****
&gt; Several major banks raised their dividends in response to successfully clearing this year’s Federal Reserve stress tests, including Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. JPMorgan and Citigroup, however, said increasingly stringent capital requirements forced them to keep their dividends unchanged.
*****
&gt; Morgan Stanley shares gained nearly 4% in premarket trading.
*****
&gt; Investors will monitor more data on Tuesday including June consumer confidence and April home prices to gauge the health of the economy. Fears of a recession have increased lately as the Federal Reserve tries to combat surging inflation with aggressive rate hikes.
*****
&gt; “Market bulls who have had the rug repeatedly pulled out from under them this year may understandably be suspect of the rally, since many of 2022′s upswings have quickly given way to fresh lows and this time may be no different,” said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading at E-Trade.
*****
&gt; Shares of Nike edged lower in pre-market trading even after the sportswear company topped Wall Street’s earnings and sales expectations for the fiscal fourth-quarter despite a Covid lockdown in China and a tougher climate for consumers in the U.S.
*****
&gt; Despite last week’s bounce, the S&amp;P 500 is down nearly 14% in the second quarter, on track to post its worst quarter since the first quarter of 2020, at the depth of the pandemic.
*****
&gt; “The bounce from the bear market lows is a welcome change, though slowing economic growth and lack of capitulation among investors has many skeptical of the durability of the recovery,” said Mark Hackett, Nationwide’s chief of investment research.

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose on Thursday, as the market tried recover some of the steep losses suffered in 2022, even as recession risks rise on Wall Street.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 traded 0.8% higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 168 points, or 0.6%. Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1%.
*****
&gt; The major averages came into Thursday’s session posting strong gains for the week. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are up more than 2% in that time, while the Dow has risen nearly 2%.
*****
&gt; To be sure, stocks closed slightly lower on Wednesday as investors weighed the likelihood of a recession.
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress the central bank is “strongly committed” to bringing down inflation. He also noted that a recession is a “possibility,” a fear that has continued to weigh on Wall Street.
*****
&gt; “The odds are more likely in favor of a recession than not,” Dan Greenhaus, Solus Alternative Asset Management chief strategist, said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” “That speaks to the degree of tightening that the Federal Reserve is going to have to do now, having not done so in prior periods when perhaps they would have avoided some of the problems that are going to happen as a result.”
*****
&gt; “Unfortunately, it’s going to be more economic pain than people at least six months ago anticipated, but are increasingly coming around to the reality that that’s probably what’s going to happen,” he added.
*****
&gt; UBS is the latest investment bank this week to raise its odds of a recession to 69%, citing lackluster data last week in housing, industrial production and capital goods.
*****
&gt; “We are now watching out for any further negative follow-through or whether we simply hit a local peak and some growth momentum in the hard data resumes,” UBS said in a Thursday note.
*****
&gt; Citigroup increased its odds of a recession to 50%, citing a slide in consumer demand that could make it more difficult for the Federal Reserve to achieve a soft landing.
*****
&gt; Goldman Sachs said the probability of a downturn is “higher and more front-loaded” than it was previously. In a Monday note, the firm raised its bet of a U.S. recession to 30%, up from 15%, over the next year. It increased those odds to 48%, up from 35%, over the next two years.
*****
&gt; On Thursday, investors will be looking forward to fresh jobless claims data. Powell will also give remarks to the House, after having addressed the Senate Wednesday. The remarks are part of a congressionally mandated semiannual report on monetary policy.

&gt; **Accenture (ACN)** – The consulting firm’s shares fell 3.3% in the premarket after its quarterly revenue beat forecasts but earnings were impacted by the cost of its Russia exit.

What comes to my mind are the likes of $KO, $BLK, $BRK.B, $JPM, and $T.

Consistently delivering dividends would be a great +. 

Right now I have been focusing on Norwegian stocks, and so far I am around +350% up this year since I hit the jackpot with Solstad Offshore (ticker SOFF on the OBX exchange) and the energy stocks here have been booming.

But now feel like exploring the US market. As of today, I only have Apple (AAPL) and Lithium Americas ($LAC), not more than 1500$ invested in total - just to get a taste.

2022-06-18 20:12:46,r/stocks,Advice on expiring put below the strike price on BRK-B,"Hi All,

Appreciate the community. I am pretty new to options trading and unfortunately have gotten burned a couple times already. Worst one being exercised on a NVDA put contract for 248. I have accepted that one at this point and just riding that one out, doing cc and just bag holding and hoping to see my money back in the next few years.

I really only sell puts on stocks or indexes I may be OK owning but since we are in this downtrend, I have second thoughts on owning them at such a high strike price,especially when they suddenly go down so quick. Probably my own fault for not being able to do DD research to understand the market and best price to get in I guess.

So my question is, I got one expiring on BRK-B this Friday at 285 while the stock price is currently sitting at 268. I'm roughly down $1500 minus the $140 premium I got for the contract.

Am I pretty much screwed here if I do not want to take those 100 shares?

Any advice on this and how to avoid in the future would be appreciated. I guess, in the future, I should really be watching it daily and when I see a price close to the money, I should have just closed it and taken a little lost compared to what has unfortunately happened to me a couple times now is what I am realising. Definitely lesson learned here.

Thanks for the help.",13,9,shralplife,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/vfbwbj/advice_on_expiring_put_below_the_strike_price_on/,vfbwbj

2022-05-20 09:25:54,r/stocks,High conviction bring-it-to-grave stocks,"Few months ago when the market starts to go down, I read a comment that ""it's not done until Apple is done"", I was sceptical that companies like AAPL, AMZN and GOOGL will drop more than 20% and agree that when people are forced to pawn their family heirlooms, while they may not have hit rock bottom yet, it's a sure sign of distress.

So what other commonly-agreed high conviction bring-it-to-grave stocks that can be used as the low tide markers? I will list the FAANG first and will add more if you can let me know stocks in other sectors, like TGT and WMT? JPM?

EDIT: To clarify my question, I'm asking about high-conviction stocks now, in this period, your period. Let's say if you own AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, MCD, KO and SPY, which will be the last stock to sell if you have experienced financial hardship (I don't wish this to anyone!)?

UPDATE: I'll keep adding mentioned tickers. There are few stocks still holding strong (less than 15% discount), such as WM, KO, ABBV and MCD. Perhaps when these 10%er move into 20%er, the final heirlooms are pawned.

*****
&gt; Stock futures moved higher in early morning Wednesday as investors braced for the Federal Reserve’s big interest rate decision, where the central bank is widely expected to hike rates by half a percentage point.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 143 points, or 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 futures climbed 0.5%, and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced by 0.4%.
*****
&gt; Markets are preparing for a hawkish Fed, and the central bank is also expected to announce a plan to cut its roughly $9 trillion balance sheet by $95 billion a month, beginning in June.
*****
&gt; Respondents to the May CNBC Fed Survey indicated they expect the central bank to announce the long-anticipated 50 basis point hike on Wednesday, followed by a second one in June as it looks to cut its balance sheet. The majority of respondents also expect a recession at the end of the tightening cycle, the survey found.
*****
&gt; “High inflation constrains the Fed, making easing monetary policy less likely if growth (or markets) fall. We have long argued that elevated inflation would put the Fed in a bind – when growth weakens they would not be willing to or able to ride to the rescue by loosening monetary policy,” Citi quantitative strategist Alexander Saunders said in a note to clients.

&gt; This year, stocks have fallen sharply and Treasury yields have spiked, but it is not clear if the market has fully accounted for an aggressive Fed.
*****
&gt; “We’re at a place right now where the market’s pricing in that inflation is going to be back near pre-pandemic levels within two years with only modest Fed tightening,” said Rebecca Patterson, Bridgewater’s chief investment strategist, on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday. “We think that either the Fed is going to have to tighten more than expected to get inflation to their target or inflation is going to be higher than expected.”
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, Lyft plummeted 26% in premarket trading after the ridesharing company shared on Tuesday evening weak guidance for the current quarter as it expects to invest in driver supply. Airbnb rose 3.6% as the company expects a continued travel rebound, and Starbucks added 2.4% after topping revenue estimates.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices also moved higher after its report, gaining about 6%. Casino stock Caesars Entertainment was under pressure after missing estimates on the top and bottom lines.
*****
&gt; On Tuesday, the Dow added 0.20%, and the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.48%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.22%.
*****
&gt; The moves came as the markets attempt to recover from a brutal tech-led April sell-off that saw the Nasdaq hit its worst month since 2008. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 also finished their worst month since March 2020.
*****
&gt; “If our ‘no recessions soon’ call is right, then the pattern we have seen so far this year will probably continue: with equities punching lower and then recovering at least partially as long as recession fails to materialize, and the rates and commodity curves continuing to move higher over time,” wrote Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs’ chief economist on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is currently trading in correction territory, down about 12.4% year to date. LPL Financial’s Ryan Detrick pointed out Tuesday the current correction parallels the size and length of previous corrections after World War II.

My understanding is that this is essentially a fund that owns a bunch of that stock and is sort of selling fractional shares in CAD. 

What am I missing here? What are the pros and cons of this? Is this just a more accessible version of the original stock? How closely is this stock tied to the actual stock?

And of course, should I by the hedged fund in CAD because I'm poor? Or should I save up money to buy the big stock?

# [Stock futures fall after the Nasdaq posts worst month since 2008](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. stock index futures were little changed on Monday morning after the Nasdaq Composite Index posted its worst month since 2008, pressured by rising rates, rampant inflation and underwhelming earnings from some of the largest technology companies.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 30 points, or 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures were shed 0.4%, while Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.6%.
*****
&gt; The major averages sank on Friday, accelerating April’s losses. The Dow dropped 939 points during the session, bringing its loss last week to roughly 2.5%. It was the 30-stock benchmark’s fifth-straight negative week.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 declined 3.63% on Friday, its worst day since June 2020, and posted its fourth-straight negative week for the first time since September 2020. The Nasdaq also posted a fourth-straight week of losses, after falling 4.2% on Friday. Both indexes registered their lowest closing levels of the year.
*****
&gt; “As we turn the calendar to May, we may see a short-term oversold bounce, however, we still have several reasons for concern. We believe our longer-term equity indicators are not yet oversold enough to have a high conviction ‘Buy’ call. We also believe managers have started to re-price stocks using recession like multiples. If that is the case, we are still over-valued,” MKM Partners chief market technician JC O’Hara said in a note clients.
*****
&gt; The Dow and S&amp;P 500 are coming off their worst month since March 2020, when the pandemic took hold. The Dow finished April 4.9% lower, while the S&amp;P tanked 8.8%.
*****
&gt; The selling was even more extreme in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which plunged 13.26% in April, its worst month since October 2008. The steep decline follows underperformance from large tech companies, including Amazon, Netflix and Meta Platforms.
*****
&gt; “Disappointing guidance from technology giants Amazon and Apple have exacerbated concern that a decidedly more hawkish Fed, coupled with still intractable supply chain issues, and rising energy prices may make the hope of a ‘soft landing’ from the Fed more elusive,” said Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial.
*****
&gt; Netflix fell 49% last month, with Amazon and Meta losing 24% and 10.8%, respectively. Tech stocks have been hit especially hard since their often-elevated valuations and promise of future growth begin to look less attractive in a rising-rate environment.
*****
&gt; Investors are looking ahead to Wednesday, when the Federal Open Market Committee will issue a statement on monetary policy. The decision will be released at 2 p.m. ET, with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell holding a press conference at 2:30 p.m.
*****
&gt; “With inflation so high and earnings growth slowing rapidly, stocks no longer provide the inflation hedge many investors are counting on. Real earnings yield tends to lead real stock returns on a y/y basis by about 6 months. It suggests we have meaningful downside at the index level as investors figure this out,” Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson said in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; Another key economic indicator will come Friday when April’s jobs report is released.
*****
&gt; Earnings season is now more than halfway finished, but a number of companies are set to post results in the coming week, including a host of consumer-focused restaurant and travel companies.
*****
&gt; Expedia, MGM Resorts, Pfizer, Airbnb, Starbucks, Lyft, Marriott, Yum Brands, Uber eBay and TripAdvisor are just some of the names on deck.
*****
&gt; Of the 275 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported earnings so far, 80% have beat earnings estimates with 73% topping revenue expectations, according to data from Refinitiv.

# **Seasonal trends could be a drag on a stock market that needs a rebound - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/29/seasonal-trends-could-be-a-drag-on-a-stock-market-that-needs-a-rebound.html)**
*****
&gt; Investors will be looking for a reprieve after the worst month for stocks in more than two years, but the calendar might not be too friendly from here.
*****
&gt; Rising interest rates, some high-profile earnings misses and burgeoning concerns about global growth took a toll on the stock market in April.
*****
&gt; The big drawdown comes on the eve of a historically weak period for stocks, with the “sell in May and go away” mindset officially beginning next week. According to the Stock Traders Almanac, an investor who held the Dow Jones Industrial Average between Nov. 1 and April 30, and then switched to fixed income for the next six months, would have produced solid returns with reduced risk for more than seven decades now.
*****
&gt; That seasonal weakness can be especially pronounced in midterm election years, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
*****
&gt; “Sometimes it has paid to lock in gains ahead of the traditionally challenging May-through-October periods. And this particularly goes for midterm election years, also known as ‘sophomore slumps.’ Indeed, since 1992, the S&amp;P 500 fell an average 3.4% in the May-through-October period of midterm election years,” Stovall said in a note to clients Monday.
*****
&gt; However, jumping to fixed income, as the simple strategy suggests, might not be smartest move.
*****
“Cashing out might not be the best option either, since equal exposure to the defensive consumer staples and health care sectors from May through October outpaced the broader benchmark 100% of these years and posted an average six-month total return of 5.6%,” Stovall wrote.
*****
&gt; # Did May selling come early?
&gt; To be sure, those defensive sectors Stovall highlighted have already been outperforming in recent weeks.
*****
&gt; And what about the tech sector, which has been sliding for nearly six months now? Some metrics and market action suggest that the sell-off has gone far enough.
*****
&gt; “Regardless of whether the market is sold out, you can argue tech, especially, is due for a bounce. Both Microsoft and Meta have rallied back to, but not quite through, their respective 50-day averages. These seem key points,” Frank Gretz, a technical analyst at Wellington Shields, said in a note to clients on Friday.
*****
&gt; It is possible that the sell-in-May trend simply started a bit early in 2022.
*****
&gt; However, there is still some concern that valuations remain too high in parts of the market.
*****
&gt; “When adjusted for stock compensation, the median tech and communication services companies’ free cash flow yields are below the overall market and most defensive sectors. This suggests that cash flow isn’t at the point at which to support current tech valuation,” Chris Senyek of Wolfe Research said in a note to clients Friday.
*****
&gt; # Fed meeting ahead
&gt; One thing that could break a seasonal trend next week is the Federal Reserve’s upcoming meeting. The central bank is set to release an updated policy statement on Wednesday, followed by a press conference from Chair Jerome Powell.
*****
&gt; The market is pricing in a 50 basis point rate hike on Wednesday, but recent Fed speakers have signaled increasing aggressiveness about the fight against inflation.
*****
&gt; “The question becomes ‘What will the Fed break?’ If they stick to their verbal outline, their verbal commitment to price stability, how far are they willing to go and what do they see that can break?” asked Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial.
*****
&gt; One term that has come up in recent weeks is “front loading” — the potential for the Fed to do multiple 50-basis point or higher hikes in the months ahead to get close to or even above the supposed neutral policy rate.
*****
&gt; According to the CME FedWatch tool, traders see the Fed funds rate potentially rising to 3% or higher by the end of the year.
*****
&gt; “They have the luxury at this point of a strong labor market. Why not go in and take it from their toolkit as best they can and try to slow demand as quickly as possible,” Krosby said.
*****
&gt; After the Fed news on Wednesday, investors will get key labor market data in jobless claims on Thursday and nonfarm payrolls on Friday.
*****
&gt; The monthly jobs report for April could get some extra attention this week after a surprise negative gross domestic product reading for the first quarter. Though that decline was driven largely by export and inventory numbers, traders and money managers are watching closely for signs of economic deterioration in the U.S.

&gt; # 6 Charts Focused on the Long Term

&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 Index in correction territory (down more than 10% from the previous peak) while the market faces a number of big threats, including inflation, a hawkish Federal Reserve, soaring yields, and war in Eastern Europe, investor anxiety levels are understandably elevated. During volatile markets, it’s difficult to focus on anything beyond the short term, but at times like this studying market history for reminders of the benefits of long-term investing can be helpful for investors

&gt; “Individual investors have the benefit of time on their side,” wrote LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “History shows that patience is rewarded during volatile periods in the market. This looks like one of those times.”

&gt; Below are 6 charts we think may help investors stay focused on the long term.

&gt; First, simply put, stocks have gone up over time as shown in the chart below. Based on this 122-year data series of the Dow Jones Industrials, stocks have gained 9.5% annualized including dividends. That’s a pretty good long-term track record.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-4.29.22.png))**

&gt; So what has driven those big gains for stocks all those years? Earnings, plain and simple. While we don’t have 122 years of earnings data for the Dow, we do have 70 years of S&amp;P 500 earnings per share data, shown in the chart below. Earnings have grown at an annualized pace of 7.5% over this time period, consistent with long-term stock price appreciation (excluding dividends).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-2-4.29.22.png))**

&gt; The next chart shows how punitive it can be to be out of the market on its best days. Though the S&amp;P 500 Index is unmanaged and can’t be owned directly, it’s clear that owning stocks for the long run has been very rewarding and moving in and out and potentially missing out on gains can be costly. Stocks experienced some significant downdrafts during the 31-year period shown in the chart (2000-2002 and 2008-2009 to be specific) and yet the S&amp;P 500 Index still rose an average of 9.9% per year during that time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chart-4-4.29.22.png))**

&gt; The next chart shows the probability of S&amp;P 500 Index gains over various rolling time periods since 1950. Based on monthly data, the index was higher in more than 80% of all rolling 3-year and 5-year periods. Going out further, 92% of all 10-year rolling periods saw the S&amp;P 500 move higher, while the S&amp;P 500 was higher 100% of the time for all rolling 15-year periods. In other words, those with a greater than a 10-year investing time horizon have an excellent chance to achieve positive returns.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-5-4.29.22.png))**

&gt; It’s also important for investors to remember that when stocks fall, they usually become cheaper relative to earnings. LPL Research certainly believes this is relevant today given the solid earnings trends still in place (despite several high profile disappointments among mega-cap tech and internet stocks this quarter).

&gt; The next chart illustrates the relationship between stock valuations—measured by the S&amp;P 500 price-to-earnings ratio (P/E)—and future stock performance. Specifically, the chart shows the future 10-year returns an investor might expect based on the valuation levels at a given point in time. If this relationship holds going forward, then buying stocks at a 19 P/E today positions investors for better long-term returns—perhaps 5-6% annually—than the 24 P/E observed at the start of the year. Note that the P/E scale on the chart’s right axis is inverted, so a rising line reflects lower valuations.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-7.png))**

&gt; Earlier this week LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick published a chart (shown here) showing the average maximum peak-to-trough decline in a given year has been 14%. Put another way, as shown in the chart below, on average the S&amp;P 500 has experienced one 10% or greater correction per year. The takeaway here is that the volatility experienced this year, with the S&amp;P 500 falling 13% from January 3 through March 8, is actually quite normal.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-8-4.22.22.png))**

&gt; So there you have it. Six charts to help put the latest bout of volatility in perspective and remind us of the benefits of long-term investing. Bottom line, be patient, stick to your plan, and if you have a long-term time horizon with a relatively conservative asset allocation, this might not be a bad time to consider adding some equities.

&gt; # A Closer Look At The Stock Market Sell Off

&gt; The selloff continued on Tuesday, with the S&amp;P 500 Index down 7.8% in the usually bullish month of April. With three days to go, this could go down as the worst April since a 9.0% drop in 1970.

&gt; The usual suspects of a slowing economy, a hawkish Federal Reserve Bank (Fed), supply chain worries, war in Europe, and now another China shutdown have all combined to make this one of the worst starts to a year ever for both stocks and bonds.

&gt; It is important to remember, though, that historically midterm years can be rough, down more than 17% on average peak-to-trough. The March 8 closing low, which amounted to a 13% correction, is still the low for the year as of now. The good news is a year off those lows stocks have historically gained more than 32% on average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-4.27.22.png))**

&gt; One potential worry is in midterm years stocks usually bottom later in the year. “Could stocks bottom for the year in March or April? Sure, but history would say midterm year lows tend to be later in the year,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “You’d have to chalk this up as one clear potential worry out there still.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, midterm years see the S&amp;P 500 bottom on August 14 on average, and the median bottom is in early September. But the good news that is important for investors to remember is big gains a year off those lows have been quite common.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-2-4.27.22.png))**

&gt; Something else to remember is just how strong the bull market was off the March 2020 lows. As you can see below, this is still the second best start to a bull market ever. After the fastest bull market to double in history, some type of potential weakness or consolidation shouldn’t be overly surprising.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-3-4.27.22.png))**

&gt; Many investors forget that double-digit declines during a year are actually normal. After only one 5% pullback all of last year, markets have provided an unfriendly reminder in 2022. In fact, since 1980, the average correction each year is 14.0%, putting this year’s 13.0% correction in perspective. Taking this a step further, 21 times since 1980 the S&amp;P 500 has been down double digits at one point from its peak, with an impressive 12 of those years managing to come back and finish the year positive. In fact, the average yearly gain those 12 years was a very solid 17.0%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chart-4-4.27.22.png))**

&gt; Lastly, we knew coming into this year that more volatility was possible, potentially early in the year as that’s been the playbook during midterm years. Looking at the entire four-year Presidential cycle shows that this quarter is actually the worst out of 16. Last quarter (year 2, quarter 1) and next quarter (year 2, quarter 3) are pretty weak as well. The good news is some stronger quarters are right around the corner.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-5-4.27.22.png))**

&gt; The weakness we’ve seen so far this year has been disappointing and taken many investors by surprise. But after more than a 100% rally off the March 2020 lows, some type of usual midterm year frustration was likely. Continue to follow LPL Research, as we help you navigate the investments landscape.

&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Down Year-to-Date and Down in April Preceded Year Loss 69.2% of the Time

&gt; With just two trading days remaining, April will not likely live up to its historically bullish reputation this year. S&amp;P 500 decline in April as of today is 7.65%, second worst April since 1950 and sixth worst since 1930. As of today’s close, the third from last trading day of April, S&amp;P 500 year-to-date loss of 12.22% is second worse in our data going back to 1930. The worst year was 1970. Since 1950 the combination of a down S&amp;P 500 April combined with a year-to-date loss has been a clearly bearish indicator. Of the previous 13 occasions since 1950, the following May was positive five times with an average loss of 0.39% and the full year finished positive four times. The only full-year double digit gain was way back in 1952. The average loss in all years was 7.26%.

&gt; # Welcome To the Weak Spot of the 4-Year Cycle

&gt; Unfortunately, the market entered the weak spot of the 4-Year Election Cycle this month with an array of headwinds from the Fed, Inflation, the Ukraine War and now most concerning the China’s unprecedented Covid lockdowns and testing. This situation has the potential to generate the greatest impact on the global economy as it could severely restrict the flow of essential raw materials and goods around the world.

&gt; The market is also suffering from the usual disappointments, unmet promises and miscues from the new incumbent administration that has historically restricted market gains through Q2-Q3 of the midterm election – the period we’ve only just begun. As you can see in the chart here Q2-Q3 are the weakest two quarters of the 4-Year Cycle, averaging losses of -1.2% for DJIA and -1.5% for S&amp;P 500 since 1949, and -5.0% for NASDAQ since 1971.

&gt; The good news is that this weak spot immediately proceeds the “Sweet Spot” of the 4-Year Cycle, which runs from Q4 of the Midterm Year through Q2 of the Pre-Election Year, averaging gains of 19.3% for DJIA and 20.0% for S&amp;P 500 since 1949, and 29.3% for NASDAQ since 1971.

&gt; Caution is definitely in order over the next “Worst Six Months.” We already issued our Seasonal Best Six Months MACD Sell Signal on April 7. But be ready to pounce on the perennial Midterm year bottom that is most likely to hit sometime over the next six months.

&gt; # May is Second Worst S&amp;P 500 Month in Midterm Election Years

&gt; May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 “flash crash”. It used to be part of what we once called the “May/June disaster area.” From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.

&gt; In the years since 1997, May’s performance has been erratic; DJIA up thirteen times in the past twenty-four years (four of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down –11.9% in 2000, followed by thirteen sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and six losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010 followed by another sizable loss of 7.9% in 2019.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e5a8236c820bc5f672ec17dd414c5228/3c57636b132072af-df/s400x600/9b971e3568cbadf1790efcc02c3e7b97aef2c8f0.jpg))**

&gt; Since 1950, midterm-year Mays rank poorly, #10 DJIA, #11 S&amp;P 500, #8 NASDAQ, #6 Russell 1000 and #9 Russell 2000. Performance ranges from a best of +0.1% by Russell 1000 to a worst of –1.1% for Russell 2000. Not one of these indexes has been positive more than 50% of the time in midterm years.

2022-04-07 09:59:09,r/stocks,HP’s stock rockets after Berkshire Hathaway reveals 11% stake,"Shares of HP Inc. surged in after-hours trading Wednesday after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. disclosed that it had taken a large stake in the Silicon Valley maker of personal computers and printers. 

Berkshire BRK.A, +0.19% BRK.B, -0.03% disclosed in a late Wednesday filing that it owned 120.95 million shares of HP HPQ, -3.03% after buying shares in recent days. That position is worth about $4.2 billion and represents a roughly 11% stake in the company. The stock rose nearly 10% in after-hours trading.

“HP is committed to one of the largest share-repurchase programs (relative to market cap) within our coverage, so we think Berkshire’s involvement makes sense,” Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a note to clients.

While he said he didn’t believe that Berkshire’s investment in HP would drive significant changes to HP’s business, he deemed the high-profile stake a “validation of HPQ’s strategy/capital return program,” noting that Berkshire began purchasing shares after HP announced plans to purchase the workplace-technologies company Poly for $3.3 billion late last month.

Berkshire’s HP stake indicates that Buffett sees value in HP’s business, though several analysts have sounded cautious lately on the market for personal computers following a pandemic-driven boom.

“Specifically, we believe PC and consumer hardware spending will be pressured as supply improves and demand normalizes after two years of above-trend growth,” Morgan Stanley’s Erik Woodring wrote in explaining his March 31 downgrades of HP and Dell Inc.

Here's my list with a note/explanation of why for each one:

GOOG - Moat (search), growth (YouTube), high margins, high ROIC, best engineering workforce in the world

COST - See Nick Sleep's description of the business

NVDA - Moat (hardware IP + SW stack), rapidly expanding TAM, pricing power, high margins, high ROIC

MSFT - High margins, high ROIC

AAPL - Moat (consumer preference and ecosystem lock-in), high ROIC, buys back stock

VRSN - Regulatory monopoly, 80% gross margin, 60% EBIT margin, extremely high ROIC, buyback machine

BRK.B - Slow but consistent grower, management aligned with shareholder interests long term, owns terrific assets, avoids bad assets (capital allocation)

For example, BRK.A is about 800 Billion company right now and it is pretty clear it will eventually be a trillion dollar company in a few years, even if Buffett and Munger died. 

I'm asking for only blue chips companies and not small/mid cap companies.

2022-03-29 08:21:17,r/stocks,Outlook for $BRK.B for the next 12 months?,"Hello. I'm from Turkey and if you follow the news regarding our country lately we have a hyperinflation-ish situation (which is still going on) in our country and a FX crisis (peaked 3 months ago but the fundamental risk still exists). In addition we have a huge boom in housing prices especially in Istanbul, which is where I'd like to buy a house. Real estate prices increased %20 in USD terms, whereas my salary is down like  %5 in USD terms (and I'm actually very lucky compared to the most of the other employees who didn't get this much of a salary raise since I got a %85 raise in TRY terms). So, in short, things are not looking good both for the time being and for the future..


As I said above I have an intention to buy a house in Istanbul but for this to happen, first I need to sell another house in a minor city where the real estate prices didn't increase much compared to Istanbul. So I don't know when will this sale happen and thus I'd like to invest my current cash position in a valuable stock which will perform relatively well for at least upcoming 12 months. When I looked into it, $BRK.B looked like an obvious choice for that kind of investment but I'd like to get your opinion on this. Based on the fundamentals, the company seems quite a bit undervalued right now. However on the other hand, it is currently in it's (almost) ATH price and the last analyst expectation for its price was $364, so it seems there's not much room left for the potential growth from that perspective. I personally believe in Uncle Warren and I heard that he bought some oil companies a while ago so even if we have an inflationary period of time for the upcoming 12 month, BRK.B might perform relatively well compared to the rest of the market, but overall do you think is it (still) a good time to buy this share at  the moment?",6,2,coolguyxtremist,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tqtegt/outlook_for_brkb_for_the_next_12_months/,tqtegt

I am a passive Index Investor (90% in MSCI World ETF and 10% in QQQ and some Dividend Champions) but recently I read alot about Holding Companys/Conglomerates like Markel, Danaher Or of course Berkshire…the most well known of them all. 

Do you guys have any opinion on these three companies and their future outlooks in comparison to the broader market? They seem to be kind of like an index fund but without the fees. 

Especially Berkshire and Markel seem to do very good in times like these….maybe it is worth a Try to invest in this companies rather than the SP500 or the World Index? 

Thoughts and arguments would be appreciated!",13,5,LOLDonkaments187,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tozqkm/investing_in_stocks_like_berkshire_brkb_markel/,tozqkm
2022-03-21 14:01:14,r/stocks,(3/21) Monday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"# Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a frrrrrrrrrrresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, March 21st, 2022-

*****

# [S&amp;P 500 futures are little changed after the benchmark’s best week since 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/20/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures were little changed in early morning trading Monday after the benchmark index’s best week since 2020.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged down about 80 points, or 0.2%, as Boeing dropped more than 6% in the premarket after a China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737 passenger plane crashed. S&amp;P 500 futures were near flat. Nasdaq 100 futures ticked down 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Last week, the three major averages notched their best week since November 2020, boosted largely by growth stocks. The S&amp;P 500 surged 6.1% from Monday to Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the week 5.5% higher, and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite spiked 8.1%.
*****
&gt; “After one of the best weeks in years, now the question is will stocks be able to hold those gains?” said Ryan Detrick of LPL Financial.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 recouped nearly half of its correction losses last week as investors received highly anticipated clarity from the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates for the first time since 2018. The central bank signaled it expects to raise rates at its remaining six meetings this year.
*****
&gt; Market participants are also monitoring the war between Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned if peace talks with Russian leader Vladimir Putin fail, it would mean the start of a “third world war.”
*****
&gt; Ukrainian and Russian officials have met intermittently for peace talks, which have failed to progress to key concessions. Ukraine has also rejected an ultimatum to surrender the city of Mariupol to Russian troops.
*****
&gt; Oil prices rose about 4% on Monday, with Brent crude above $110 a barrel, as European Union nations considered joining the U.S. in an embargo on Russian oil.
*****
&gt; Investors are also evaluating a rise in Covid cases in Europe stemming from an emerging variant.
*****
&gt; Some market strategists are not convinced of the rally in stocks.
*****
&gt; “Bear market rallies are the most vicious. The rally in equities over the past week was one of the sharpest on record. While it could go a bit higher ... we remain convicted it’s still a bear market and we would use this strength to position more defensively,” Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson said in a note Monday.
*****
&gt; The economic calendar is relatively light this week but several companies report earnings. Nike and Tencent Music report quarterly results on Monday.

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Thursday morning, following back-to-back days of sharp gains, as investors digested the latest news out of Ukraine.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 100 points, or about 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures slid 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The Kremlin poured cold water over reports that indicated progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, according to Bloomberg News.
*****
&gt; On Wednesday, the Financial Time reported that both countries had made “significant progress” on a peace plan and Russian withdrawal from Ukraine. That FT report helped stocks rally for a second day Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Wall Street was also digesting the latest moves from the Federal Reserve. The Fed hiked its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2018 and signaled six more hikes this year, spurring a relief rally in stocks.
*****
&gt; The Fed also significantly raised its projections for rate hikes and inflation in 2022, but investors appear to have taken those aggressive changes as proof the central bank was taking the rise in prices seriously.
*****
&gt; “The dot plot shows they’re behind the curve, and we all know they’re behind the curve, and they’re trying to fix it,” said Stephanie Link, chief investment strategist and portfolio manager at Hightower Advisors. “At least they’re telling the market ‘we’re trying to fix it.’”
*****
&gt; Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital, said on “Closing Bell: Overtime” that he expected markets to rally between now and the next Fed meeting in May after selling off sharply to start the year. He pointed to recent high readings on the Cboe Volatility Index, often called Wall Street’s fear gauge, as a sign that the selling had gone far enough, at least in the near term.
*****
&gt; “When the VIX gets above 35, I don’t care how bad the tape looks, I don’t care how bad the geopolitics look, you’re supposed to get more bullish, not more bearish. And you get an oversold bounce,” Gundlach said.
*****
&gt; On Wednesday, the Dow rose 518.76 points, or 1.55%, for its first three-day winning streak in more than a month. It was also the Dow’s second straight day gaining more than 500 points. The S&amp;P 500 gained 2.24%, while the Nasdaq Composite jumped 3.77%.

Or that they are done with x strategy and switching to y. Just remember that markets tend to move in cycles. So growth had a huge movement but then cooled. It doesn’t mean they are done forever or will underperform in the future. It’s a return of equilibrium. Same thing with oil prices, value stocks etc. things come into favor with the market and then go out and come back in again. One of the biggest pitfalls is trying to always move your money into whatever is favorable at the moment and selling out of what’s unfavorable. It’s often better to just sit and wait. Growth names will grow again. The S&amp;P will outperform BRK at some point. Commodities will continue to go in and out of favor. Be careful making rash moves or judgements to try and keep up with the market. Diversify, research and don’t make changes to your portfolio unless something has really and truly changed with the business.

2022-03-14 02:44:32,r/stocks,ELI5: Why do companies do stock splits when fractional investing is possible?,"Everything I’ve read talks about how stock splits increase a stock’s attractiveness to a “wider” audience (aka poorer investors). But how does that matter in an age where you can just buy pieces of stock? Is it just a psychological play to change the perception of a stock’s affordability? Even though now all stocks are (at least partially) affordable?

EDIT: 
Taking the popularity of this post as at least a sign that I'm not the only one who was confused. Lots of good points here that I hadn't considered - mainly the effect price per share has on the options market.

That said, I feel like the options market is a big reason why folks feel like the market is disconnected from reality (and gamified). I wonder if this plays into why BRK-A never got a split. Maybe Buffett knew that derivatives are cancerous, so having an obscene price effectively insulates it from anything outside of buy-and-hold plays.

Also, never knew the Dow was weighted by stock price instead of market cap. What a crock of shit.",1178,400,MickeyKae,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tdm5iy/eli5_why_do_companies_do_stock_splits_when/,tdm5iy

# **With the stock market’s snapback, the focus shifts to Powell testimony and jobs report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/25/with-the-stock-markets-snapback-the-focus-shifts-to-powell-testimony-and-jobs-report.html)**
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before Congress in the week ahead, and markets will hang on what he says regarding how the Russia-Ukraine conflict could affect Fed policy.
*****
&gt; Powell will deliver his testimony on the economy to the House Committee on Financial Services on Wednesday morning, and then again to the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday. The important February employment report is to be released on Friday.
*****
&gt; “Powell speaking is going to be important. Everybody’s trying to get a gauge of how he’s seeing what the Fed’s policy reaction might be in light of recent events,” said Jim Caron, head of macro strategies for global fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.
*****
&gt; Investors also are keeping a careful eye on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and its related impact on markets, with Russia being a major commodity exporter. Oil initially shot higher in the past week, with Brent crude surging to $105 per barrel before settling back down to about $98 on Friday.
*****
&gt; “I think Powell’s going to have to still be pretty hawkish, even though there’s still concerns about what oil prices are going to do to demand. The surge in oil prices is coming at the worst possible time,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.” It’s stoking a well-kindled fire of inflation.”
*****
&gt; # Market reversal
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 posted a weekly gain after some wild swings. Stocks fell sharply Thursday on news of the invasion, but later bounced. The index extended that rebound into Friday, rising more than 2%. Bond yields, initially lower in a flight-to-safety trade, reversed course and were higher Friday.
*****
&gt; “Treasurys are supposed to be the flight-to-safety asset, and you didn’t make money in Treasurys when you had a geopolitical event,” Caron said. Yields move inversely to prices, and the 10-year yield was back near 2% on Friday. “There’s no place to run, no place to hide. I think a lot of that has to do with peoples’ expectations for interest rate policy and also inflation.”
*****
&gt; Jeff Kleintop, Charles Schwab chief global investment strategist, said the stock market was relieved with the clarity on sanctions against Russia. President Joe Biden announced on Thursday a new round of sanctions after the invasion.
*****
&gt; “The fact they specifically excluded energy and agriculture [in the new sanctions] means the spillover effects to the global economy are very limited,” Kleintop said. “It doesn’t change some of the trends that were in place prior to the invasion, which of course is the tightening of financial conditions and concerns about inflation.”
*****
&gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the impact on global gross domestic product will likely be small, since both Russia and Ukraine together account for just about 2% of global market-based GDP.
*****
&gt; “In contrast, spillovers via commodity markets (Russia produces 11% and 17% of global oil and gas) and financial conditions could be somewhat larger,” the economists noted.
*****
&gt; # Fed rate hikes
&gt; Schwab’s Kleintop said he expects the stock market to remain volatile into the Fed’s first rate hike, expected at its March meeting.
*****
&gt; “We have been in a downtrend. Markets are concerned about valuations,” he said. As focus shifts away from Ukraine, “I think we’ll settle back to that more difficult, more volatile environment, but the concerns that this is a major disruptive break that completely changes the backdrop is probably not turning out to be the case.”
*****
&gt; Caron said investors are looking for some clarity on whether the Ukraine situation could cause the Fed to slow down interest rate hikes in 2022.
*****
&gt; A big question remains as to whether the Fed might raise rates by 50 basis points on March 16 to kick off its first round of rate increases since 2018. A basis point is equal to 0.01%.
*****
&gt; “I do think that the situation in the Ukraine makes it much less likely they will raise by 50 basis points this time around,” said PNC chief economist Gus Faucher, noting that the Fed will keep on a steady course and weigh the circumstances as it moves to hike.
*****
&gt; However, traders will also look for clues on how the central bank could go about reducing its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet.
*****
&gt; Caron said many investors expect the Fed to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury and mortgage securities by June or July.
*****
&gt; “It’s really about liquidity in the market. What we’re really trying to assess is whether this Russia-Ukraine creates a systemic risk,” he said. Downsizing the balance sheet is about draining liquidity from the financial system.
*****
&gt; Caron added the stock market was getting some relief from the belief the Fed will not move as quickly as some expect because of the Ukraine conflict. “People believe rates are going to go higher, but not uncomfortably higher so all the growth equities are doing better in this environment,” he said.
*****
&gt; He also said the February jobs report is important but it won’t change the Fed’s path.
*****
&gt; # Jobs, jobs, jobs
&gt; In January, 467,000 payrolls were added, and revisions announced in early February put the pace of recent job growth at about 500,000.
*****
&gt; Swonk said she expects 400,000 jobs were added in February.
*****
&gt; “We know that job postings in February picked up after a lull during the omicron wave and that should show up with more job gains in February as well. ... We also saw the ramping up for the spring break season,” the economist said, noting she expects more jobs in leisure and hospitality and gains in everything from manufacturing to professional business services.
*****
&gt; # Boiling oil
&gt; Oil prices will likely remain volatile with some strategists expecting continued gains. OPEC+ holds its monthly meeting Wednesday. Oil was lower Friday, as speculation grew that Iran could soon reach a deal on its nuclear program that would allow it to return 1 million barrels to the market.
*****
&gt; “That’s why you’ve seen the market react the way it has. There’s a decent amount of oil,” said John Kilduff of Again Capital.
*****
&gt; West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down 1% on Friday at $91.86 per barrel.
*****
&gt; # Bullish bet?
&gt; Some strategists expect the market may have set a bottom when it snapped back higher Thursday.
*****
&gt; But one investor appears to be making a big bet on a bullish move by the market.
*****
&gt; “We had an investor who was just making a very bullish bet in the S&amp;P 500, for the last three days. He doubled down on his bet today that it’s going higher,” said Cardinal Capital founder Pat Kernan on Friday.
*****
&gt; Kernan, who works in the Cboe S&amp;P 500 options pit, said the trade was a “real money” bet of more than $200 million.
*****
&gt; The investor bought 65,000 call spreads that expire every Friday between March 4 and March 25. The biggest bet was 30,000 call spreads that expire March 18, right after the Fed meeting.
*****
&gt; The breakeven price suggests the investor believes the S&amp;P 500 will be at least as high as 4,460 at that point.
*****
&gt; Kernan said the market changed totally Friday, and it had been very different earlier in the week.
*****
&gt; “It was crazy fearful two nights ago. This is one of the most bizarre markets we’ve seen, but every single down tick today, they just bought it,” he said of S&amp;P futures.

&gt; # Cold War 2.0 – Midterm Bottom Nears

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/feb25bd4cdbe0ffd38abe3b85d7ef57c/ec436ef0b8793cc1-b0/s500x750/1a889a3555ac7f2bd39bd75e8f97cd37e16a7d3c.jpg))**

&gt; In the table here we compiled the relevant historical geopolitical events that had an impact on energy prices and/or sovereign boundaries. As you can see the longer more drawn-out crises were accompanied by weaker markets. Arguably back in 2014 Putin stopped in Crimea due to plunging oil prices hurting his coffers. Our guess is he will use the same playbook or similar for the rest of Ukraine and eventually kick out the pro-western government and hold some kind of election to install and establish a new pro-Russian government.

&gt; It looks likely Russia will take over all or most of Ukraine. There will be resistance, but Ukraine’s military is no match for Russia and there is not much the west can do about it either on the ground or militarily. We just don’t have the stomach or bandwidth for it. Sure, we will battle him on the economic front with sanctions and with cyber as well as support for Ukraine and NATO, but Russia has prepared for this and has withstood it before for decades during the Cold War. We are likely looking at sanctions on Russia for many years.

&gt; However, the market showed some impressive resilience to this invasion with the big rebound yesterday and today. As we have been warning all year long this is typical midterm election action for a new president where foreign adversaries take advantage of new administration weakness and unpreparedness.

&gt; Unfortunately, our worst-case scenario has now come into play. But on the positive side it looks like the midterm bottom is nearing. When we made our 2022 Annual Forecast this past December prospects for a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine were low. For now, expect volatility to continue through Q2 and Q3 as the market seeks support, digests the developments in Ukraine, elsewhere in the geopolitical arena and on the Fed/inflation front. We still expect the Q4 rally illustrated in our updated chart here of the S&amp;P 500 Midterm Election Year Seasonal Pattern to materialize as we approach the midterm elections in the late summer or early fall.

&gt; # Stocks Move Into A Correction

&gt; For the first time since March 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Index officially moved into a correction, down 10.3% from the recent highs. Of course, many stocks have already been in a correction, with some even in bear markets. This is yet another potential worry for investors, but should it be?

&gt; “Let’s remember the S&amp;P 500 averages about one 10% correction a year. Given it has been nearly two years without one, you could make the argument stocks were definitely due,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-2.23.22-1.png))**

&gt; What now? The good news is stocks do quite well after corrections. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this is the 33rd correction or bear market for the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. “As uncomfortable and frustrating market corrections can be, investors need to remember that future returns after such pain can bring a lot of gains,” added Ryan. In fact, after previous corrections and bear markets, the S&amp;P 500 rose nearly 90% of the time a year or two later, with very strong returns.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-2.23.22-2.png))**

&gt; With the economy still strong and many signs of over-the-top negative sentiment, we doubt the S&amp;P 500 will move into a bear market (down 20% or more), with a major low likely coming fairly soon. Here we show all the 10-15% corrections since 1980. Again, strong future returns are normal.

&gt; As part of the Best Six/Eight Months, March has historically been a solid performing month with DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 &amp; 2000 all advancing more than 62% of the time with average gains ranging from 0.6% by NASDAQ to 1% by S&amp;P 500. Over the recent 21-year period, March has tended to open well with gains accumulating over its first three trading days. Temporary weakness follows before moving modestly higher into mid-month through month’s end. Removing the highly volatile March’s of 2009 and 2020 from the recent 21-year chart has a minimal effect on the overall monthly pattern.

In midterm years March ranks: 4th best for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 and 3rd best for NASDAQ and Russell 1000 while he small-cap Russell 2000 lands at second best.

&gt; # 11 Things To Know About Russia and Ukraine

&gt; Global stock markets are selling off hard after Russian military forces attacked a broad range of targets across Ukraine last night while Russian President Putin vowed to replace Ukraine’s government. What does it all mean for stocks and the economy? “Russia invading Ukraine has added to an already tense year, with investors selling first and asking questions later,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But it is important to know that past major geopolitical events were usually short-term market issues, especially if the economy was on solid footing.”

&gt; Here we list 11 things you need to know.
&gt; * While the market reaction is likely to be more acute than the response to Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, the attack on American interests is less direct than Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
&gt; * Speaking of 2014, stocks and bonds in the U.S. both took that event in stride, while European stocks were considerably weaker for several weeks. Interestingly, crude oil spiked initially, then quickly sold off.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-1.png))**

&gt; All indexes are unmanaged and cannot be invested into directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

&gt; * Broader questions of the long-term impact on U.S. and European diplomatic and geopolitical goals, as well as the conflict’s impact on U.S. national interests, are significant but not in themselves market moving.
&gt; * Stock market drawdowns from geopolitical shocks average about 5% with recovery taking under two months, but larger conflicts in sensitive regions can be deeper and last longer.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-2.png))**

&gt; * We do expect further market volatility as the situation unfolds and elevated uncertainty may persist for several weeks, but if the conflict is contained, we do not expect long-lasting contagion to broader markets.
&gt; * As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if the economy avoids a recession after (or during) a major geopolitical event, stocks usually do just fine. “We looked at 37 major historical or geopolitical events since World War II and found that if there is no recession then stocks gain nearly 11% a year later,” explained Ryan Detrick. “The flipside is if there is a recession, stocks are down more than to 11% a year later. Given we simply don’t see a recession on the horizon due to a strong consumer and corporate earnings backdrop, this recent weakness could be an opportunity for investors.”

&gt; * Upward pressure on commodity prices, already impacted by COVID-19-related supply chain disruptions, may see a more sustained impact as economic sanctions play out and will probably be the main source of risk for possible broader economic repercussions.
&gt; * European equities have done well relative to U.S. counterparts so far this year as U.S. megacaps have stumbled, but the relative performance may stall as the crisis plays out.
&gt; * There may be some market opportunities for very active traders during the crisis, but for most investors we believe understanding the typical market response to geopolitical risks and focusing on where we’re likely to be at the end of the year rather than at the end of next week or month is likely the best response.
&gt; * Building on the note above, past market corrections of 10-15% have been followed by rather strong future performance.

&gt; * From a purely technical perspective, we continue to see near-term opportunities in commodity-exposed equities.

&gt; This is a very fluid situation and one that we are watching very closely. Please continue to follow LPL Research for any updates.

&gt; # What Is the VIX Index And How Has It Responded To Russia-Ukraine Conflict?

&gt; Stock markets go up and, as many newer investors are discovering in the turbulent start to this year, down. The frequency and magnitude of these price changes is known as volatility and the most frequently used measure for U.S. stock market volatility is the Cboe (Chicago Board Options Exchange) Volatility Index, commonly referred to as the VIX.

&gt; “The VIX is often referred to as the “fear gauge” because it spikes in times of market worries and when stocks go down,” explained LPL Financial Quantitative Strategist George Smith. “The escalating Russia-Ukraine conflict, combined with ongoing inflation and rate-hike concerns, are driving the VIX to the highest levels since 2020.”

&gt; The VIX is calculated by aggregating the weighted prices of put and call options placed on the S&amp;P 500 index and can be considered a measure of expected 30-day volatility in the U.S stock markets.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, volatility as measured by the 1-month rolling average VIX has risen sharply in the past few weeks. It spiked twice, initially in response to worries over the pace of potential Federal Reserve rate hikes and now the Russian invasion of Ukraine (as well as continuing inflation concerns).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-1.png))**

&gt; As markets have digested the military escalation in Ukraine, the closing price for the VIX for the past two days has been close to 3 standard deviations above the 12-month average. At the January and February peaks, the VIX hit intraday highs of around 38 which if it had closed at those levels would been almost 5 standard deviation events.

&gt; Like many other measures of market sentiment that we monitor extreme levels of volatility have historically had the potential to be contrarian signals when it comes to predicting stocks prices over the short term. When the VIX has closed more than 3 standard deviations above its 12-month rolling average the forward returns for the S&amp;P 500 have tended to be well above average, and within the 3- to 6-month timeframe have been more likely to be positive than on average. This extreme level on the VIX last occurred on 1/25/2022.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-2.png))**

&gt; The VIX closing greater than 50% higher than its 1-month moving average has also been a reliable contrarian indicator – as long as it has occurred outside of recessionary periods – and this last occurred on 1/25 as well. The major caveat with this indicator is that we often don’t know that we are in a recession until after the fact so caution should be used considering the prevailing economic environment (which we don’t expect to be recessionary at the present time).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-3.png))**

&gt; After an extremely quiet 2021, in which the VIX was declining throughout the year, we did expect higher volatility in 2022 as often occurs at this stage of the business cycle. However, like most of the world, outside of the kremlin, we did not expect that one of the reasons for a rise in volatility would be the largest conflict in Europe since World War Two. We do expect further market volatility as the situation unfolds and elevated uncertainty may persist for several weeks depending on how the conflict develops, but as long as the conflict is contained to Ukraine, we do not expect long-lasting contagion to broader markets. Looking back at historic geopolitical shocks stock market drawdowns average about 5% with recoveries taking less than two months, but larger conflicts in sensitive regions have led to deeper and longer lasting drawdowns.

2. At least one must be a foreign equity (outside N. America);

3. ONLY ONE may be an ETF or a conglomerate like Berkshire;

4. Each holding comprises 25% of your portfolio;

5. You are investing one lump sum of $100k at today’s valuations and will never add to the position again;

Several companies that I consider the bedrock of my portfolio are currently at pretty attractive prices. The biggest name on this list is Target, as I feel the stock price has been irrationally punished for such an amazingly strong company which trades at a notable discount to its peers. I would also include CVS, BRK and JPM in this bucket although they are not trading anywhere near the discount TGT is with both CVS and BRK fairly close to ATH (still rock solid companies in a shaky environment which continually post very solid numbers). I also would include Enphase here because of their continuously outstanding financials and strong projections.

On the more speculative side of my portfolio I would put my small cap and growth ETFs such as qqqj and scha as well as clean energy like ICLN and TAN (enphase is the standout star, I find the rest more speculative). 

And in the swing for the fences end of the spectrum I think both palantir and Sofi are currently oversold.

2022-02-03 19:24:22,r/stocks,Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Is Now Bigger Than Meta,"Warren Buffett has pulled ahead of Mark Zuckerberg in stock-market bragging rights. Berkshire Hathaway stock has been on a roll this year, and the company on Thursday reclaimed its title as the sixth largest company by market value in the U.S. after a steep decline in Meta Platforms ‘ shares.

Berkshire’s class A shares (ticker BRK.A) were down 0.9% Thursday, to $475,159, but are up 5.5% so far this year. This values Buffett’s company at about $708 billion. Berkshire’s class B shares (BRK.B) were off 0.9%, to $316.66 Thursday.

Meta Platforms (FB), formerly Facebook, is now valued at around $677 billion, with its stock down 25%, at $242, following an earnings miss and weak guidance late Wednesday. Zuckerberg is Meta’s CEO and controlling shareholder.

In market value, Berkshire is now behind only Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG and GOOGL), [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA).

2022-01-22 21:40:19,r/stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning January 24th, 2022","Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 24th, 2022.

# **Markets are expected to remain on edge as the Fed meets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/21/markets-are-expected-to-remain-on-edge-as-the-fed-meets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Market turbulence is likely to continue in the week ahead as the Federal Reserve meets and the biggest of big tech —Apple and Microsoft — report earnings.
*****
&gt; Stocks on Friday closed out their worst week since 2020, with big losses in technology and consumer discretionary names. FANG darling Netflix was ripped after its Thursday afternoon earnings, and traders are watching to see whether the same fate will take down other big tech names.
*****
&gt; It was a painful week on Wall Street, with the Nasdaq slumping 7.6% for the week, its worst performance since March, 2020. The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 4,397, down 5.7%, and is now 8.7% from its Jan. 4 high.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq has fallen 15.5% from its high and is off to its worst start to the year, through the first 14 trading days, since 2008, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve’s meeting Tuesday and Wednesday trumps everything else for markets, as investors await any new clues on how much the central bank will raise interest rates this year and when it will start. Economists expect the Fed to steer markets to a quarter-percentage-point March rate hike.
*****
&gt; There is also an avalanche of major earnings reports expected, including nearly half the Dow 30′s blue chips, such as 3M, IBM, Intel, Caterpillar and American Express. The two biggest stocks in terms of market capitalization, Microsoft and Apple, report Tuesday and Thursday respectively. Tesla reports Wednesday.
*****
&gt; The economy will also be a focus with a first look at fourth-quarter GDP on Thursday, and Friday’s personal consumption expenditures data, which includes the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.
*****
&gt; Stocks could be in for more volatile trading, after a wild week of seesaw action resulted in steep declines in major indexes. The weakest major sectors for the week were consumer discretionary, off 8.5%, followed by communication services and technology, both lower by about 7%.
*****
&gt; Earnings season has been mixed so far with some high-profile negative stock reactions when investors did not like what they heard.
*****
&gt; Netflix stock cratered Friday, losing 22% after a disappointing disclosure about subscriber data when it released earnings Thursday afternoon. JP Morgan Chase fell sharply a week earlier when it reported higher expenses and slower trading activity.
*****
&gt; “We do not think that the earnings season is a macro catalyst to send the indexes significantly in one direction or the other. This is a stock-by-stock story,” said Julian Emanuel, chief equity, derivatives and quantitative strategist at Evercore ISI.
*****
&gt; “The good reports are likely to be rewarded but in a much more muted fashion, whereas the companies that miss on either [revenues or earnings] are going to be disproportionately punished. It doesn’t matter if you beat or miss, but if you had negative comment around margins and costs, you’re going to pay a price,” he added.
*****
&gt; # Fed ahead
&gt; The same inflation that is showing up in rising costs in company earnings and higher prices has become a major concern for the Fed. Investors will be listening closely to hear how worried the Fed is about inflation when Chairman Jerome Powell briefs the media Wednesday afternoon after the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee releases its statement.
*****
&gt; The Fed is not expected to raise interest rates or change policy at this meeting, but it could be setting the stage for how it will act when it finishes up its bond buying program, likely in March. Many economists expect the Fed could start raising its fed funds target rate from near-zero with a quarter-percentage-point hike in March.
*****
&gt; “The baseline is we see four hikes and the start of quantitative tightening somewhere around the middle to later in the year,” Emanuel said. “I don’t think the Fed is going to do anything to talk the market out of that stance.”
*****
&gt; The Fed has also said it could move to shrink its balance sheet this year, and that would be another type of policy tightening, as the central bank steps back from replacing the maturing securities on its balance with market purchases. That would in essence start to decrease the size of the nearly $9 trillion balance sheet.
*****
&gt; The Fed has sounded much more hawkish, or in favor of rate hikes and other policy tightening, particularly since it released its December forecast. Powell is not likely to change his tone this week, even with stocks selling off, Emanuel said.
*****
&gt; “If Powell were going to come off sounding dovish, the presumption would be that would be a positive for the market, but we might argue that would not be,” he said. “If the market doesn’t really believe he’s going with the four-hike plan, it’s very likely that 10-year yields which have broken out of the three-year range by going over 1.80%, could make a very quick move to 2%.”
*****
&gt; He added “growth is already backfooted versus value. That would be very destabilizing for the market.”
*****
&gt; The Fed is already considered to be behind the curve by some Fed watchers.
*****
&gt; “The Fed has never responded this slowly to an emerging inflation risk and even today is signaling a benign hiking cycle,” wrote Ethan Harris, Bank of America’s head of global economic research. “If they are wrong, and inflation settles closer to 3% than 2%, it is bad news for both stocks and bonds.”
*****
&gt; # Bond yields stall
Bond yields continued to stair-step higher early in the past week but fell back down by the end of the week. The widely watched benchmark 10-year Treasury yield touched 1.9% in the middle of the week before slipping back to 1.76% Friday.
*****
&gt; Ian Lyngen, BMO head of U.S. rates strategy, said the bond market is pricing in a move in the fed funds rate to 1.75%. He said the Fed would have to indicate it could push the funds target higher in order for the 10-year to get to 2%
*****
&gt; “We expect it will consolidate in this range until Wednesday,” Lyngen said. “If the Fed does not come out as more hawkish, then we’ll see a classic ‘buy the rumor, sell the fact,’ and the 10-year yield drifts lower.” Yields move opposite price.
*****
&gt; Tech and growth stocks have been most negatively impacted by the move higher in rates. Those stocks are valued on the prospect of their future profits, and the assumption is in an environment of cheap money, valuations can be higher.
*****
&gt; But as the Fed tightens and inflation continues to flare, many strategists expect cyclical and value stocks to perform better. Since the start of the year, the technology sector is down 11.4%. Energy has been the outperformer, and is the only major sector higher this year, up 12.8%.
*****
&gt; “The Fed’s whole intent of this is to tighten financial conditions so in a way, if you’re the Fed what you’ve seen in the first three weeks of the year you may be perfectly fine with,” Emanuel said. “I don’ think if you’re Powell you’re going to try to talk the market out of the mode that it’s currently in. I think you’re pretty happy with how the year has started.”
*****
&gt; Emanuel expects the S&amp;P 500 to end the year at 5,100. As for the current sell-off, he said the S&amp;P 500 is likely to reach its 200-day moving average at about 4,425, but there’s no guarantee that will be the bottom of this sell-off.

&gt; # Tech Sheds a Trillion

&gt; Earlier this week in our Sector Weightings report, we highlighted how the weight of the Technology sector remains well above that of any other sector, though, it did come off recent highs. In terms of market cap, the Tech sector is still valued at nearly $11 trillion. The next largest sectors are Health Care and Consumer Discretionary at a little over $5 trillion. Utilities is currently the only sector with a market cap under $1 trillion. Remember, back in April 2020, the S&amp;P 1500 Energy sector's market cap got down to just $701 billion!

&gt; Taking a look at the changes three weeks into the new year, Tech has already shed over a trillion dollars in market cap. Combined, Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, and Communication Services have also fallen by over a trillion dollars. Meanwhile, only Energy has seen its market cap increase.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/01/012122-Sector-Mkt-caps.png))**

&gt; As for the individual stocks of the S&amp;P 500, there are currently five members with market caps above $1 trillion, and those five stocks have seen a combined drop in market cap of roughly $850 billion year to date. Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are the biggest of these with market caps of $2.69 trillion and $2.65 trillion respectively, and as such, their declines year to date are the largest of any S&amp;P 500 stock. Of the 25 largest S&amp;P 500 members, only a handful have seen their market caps rise so far in 2022. Exxon Mobil (XOM) has seen the largest increase followed by Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/B) and Chevron (CVX).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/01/012122-Sector-Mkt-caps-Largest.png))**

&gt; In the table below, we show the 25 S&amp;P 500 stocks that have seen their market caps rise the most this year. Not only does an Energy stock top the list, but across these 25 names, Energy stocks have the most representation. Financials also have a decent number making the list while not a single Consumer Discretionary or Tech name is to be found.

&gt; # More Lows Than Highs

&gt; With more than half of the S&amp;P 500 lower today, the index is once again looking to end the week in the red and with weak breadth. As a result of the consistent declines lately across the index, the net reading of the percentage of stocks at new 52-week highs versus lows is on pace to see the first negative reading since December 2nd.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/01/012122-Large1.png))**

&gt; Moving down through the spectrum of market caps, the readings on net new highs only get worse. The S&amp;P 400 which is comprised of mid-cap names has an even lower reading of -6.23% of net new highs today. That is the lowest since November 30th, and prior to that, you would have to go back to the record low readings of March 2020 to find the last time that there were as wide of a margin between the number of stocks hitting new lows versus new highs.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/01/012122-Mid1.png))**

&gt; Moving down again to the small cap S&amp;P 600, once again the reading only gets worse. This index is seeing a double-digit negative reading. With a net 11.13% at new 52-week lows, it is the weakest reading since March 23, 2020 and is in the 5th percentile of readings going back to the start of the data in 1995.

&gt; # A/D Line Nearing Selling Climax Indices Test Support

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/64a7ee5e9da88666041b4b7de0f5fe94/fe55510aae9d31ed-2b/s500x750/5127f441c3e9ad3199f819af9d1707739eed8d33.jpg))**

&gt; Today’s late market selloff put further pressure on support levels as 69% of stocks traded today declined while only 26% advanced, including all of the nearly 9000 stocks traded on NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ combined. This is close to the Advance Decline Selling Climax levels 70% total issues declining with no more than 15% advancing. It appears we are nearing the end of this January selloff, which may occur as we approach the FOMC meeting next week.

&gt; The chart above shows the major market averages have caught up with the decline in the NASDAQ and NYSE Advance/Decline Lines that has been going on in earnest since July 2021 and more precipitously since the November highs. NDX and NASDAQ have both hit the 10% correction level this week down -10.4% and -11.9% respectively at today’s close. From their early January highs DJIA and S&amp;P 500 are down -5.7% and -6.5% respectively.

&gt; As you can see from the chart below the NASDAQ 100 (NDX) has fallen through two support levels at 15700 and 15250 rather quickly over the past two weeks. In the process NDX and breached it’s 50- (pink line) and 200-day (blue line) moving averages and two monthly pivot point support levels (green dotted lines) as well as the uptrend line since the March 2021 low. NDX currently sits just below 14900 support and right on the uptrend line from the September/October 2020 lows.

&gt; # How Did Stocks Do The First Year Under President Biden?

&gt; President Biden took over the Oval Office a year ago yesterday, on January 20, 2021. So how did things go for the stock market? Let’s dive into it.

&gt; “The Dow gained 12.3% the first year under President Biden, which is right about the average first year return of 12.1%,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But where things really stand out is how many new highs were made, with a very impressive 43 new highs, the third most ever.”

&gt; As we share in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Dow gained 12.3% during his first year in office, which ranks 9th out of all the first years for all Presidents since 1900.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/blog-chart-1.21.22-1.png))**

&gt; Breaking it down a little more, stocks historically have done much better under a Democrat that first year than under a Republican, although that 91% gain under FDR had a lot to do with that. Still, stocks rose more than 30% during both President Obama’s and President Trump’s first years, breaking with the historical trend.

&gt; And of course, let’s not forget that stocks did amazingly well right after President Biden won the election in November 2020, so you could say some of those gains were pulled forward perhaps. Here’s a chart we shared a year ago on this. It was the best Election Day to Inauguration Day return ever.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blog-1.21.22-2.png))**

&gt; Lastly, the stock market’s gain during President Biden’s first 100 days in office was one of the best ever.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/blog-1.21.22-3.png))**

&gt; All in all, the economy and stocks did quite well the first year under President Biden. Given this is a midterm year and emotions will run high, we want to remind investors to separate your politics from your investments. Many people have not liked past Presidents, only to miss out on big gains. A strong economy (and we expect it to be this year) matters a lot more to your investments than the makeup of Congress or who is in the White House.

&gt; # January Seasonal Pattern Update: Tech &amp; Small-Cap Extend Declines

&gt; As of today’s close NASDAQ is down 8.3% and the Russell 2000 is down 8.1%. S&amp;P 500 and DJIA are down 4.9% and 3.6% respectively. This is the worst start to a year on the 12th trading day since 2016 when DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 were all down over 9%. Compared to the recent 21-year seasonal pattern for January, weakness could persist through the end of the month, but given the current magnitude of declines some modest recovery before the end of the month is also likely. One possible catalyst for a late-month rally could come from the Fed on January 26.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/0d01d8406f0b650d4360e841792a1b5a/4776f7f5429b4398-90/s500x750/35aae9447bf4c43515d3a04ec88550f0d07d6f5f.jpg))**

*****

&gt; The first Fed rate hike is like taking the training wheels off. Some volatility is perfectly normal, but by no means does it mean you fall down. In fact, bull markets go another 3 years plus after the first Fed hike, with the S&amp;P 500 up nearly 70%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zyQEBTd.png))**

&gt; Today the S&amp;P 500 closed beneath it's December low during the first quarter. Happened 36 other times since 1950. Full year up 50% of time and up only 0.3% on avg. Definitely a concern for the bulls. Not the end of the world, but a worrisome signal.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9fmezdB.png))**

&gt; Compare this to the 36 times the December lows held in Q1. S&amp;P 500 up 18.6% on average and higher 94% of the time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yKzBj2A.jpg))**

&gt; Here's a nice way to show how the December Low Indicator is a big deal. The 36 times the December lows held in Q1, full year was rather strong. The 36 times it didn't hold (like 2022), there was some tougher sledding. For now, we chalk this up as a warning sign.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wrNHRqZ.jpg))**

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is down 5.9% in Jan so far. Worst since 2016 when it was down 9.0% at one point during the month (closed the month down 5.1% though). Worst ever? Down 10.8% in 2008 and 10.9% in 2009. Again, this is the monthly low, not what where it closed at the end of the month.

&gt; It is worth noting that midterm years can be quite weak early in the year. Incredibly, the average midterm year (since '50) is actually down YTD as of October 5th..

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pQBJkMy.jpg))**

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has already pulled back 6.5% this year. Remember though, the average year (since 1980) sees a 14% pullback and your average midterm year (since 1950) pulls back 17%. After a year with very little volatility, the bottom line is 2022 was likely due for a rockier ride.

I feel more like adding to my convictions on the way down, but am not sure if I should take some of that cash (50% of the cash is in ROTH) and put it in things like financials to catch some of the ""runoff"" or is it better to hold the cash and add to my big tech after they sell off some more?

I'm in for 10 more years at very least, if not 20.

I also have 5% positions in HD SHW ODFL TMO NEE UNH and things.  Not sure if those are good hedges against tech rotation.

The 3 month average is 17 shares daily.  Looking through volume history shows another 4 figure volume day back in June and then only double or single digit shares for the rest of the year.

2021-12-18 02:31:29,r/stocks,Barron's top picks for 2022 (IBM what?),"I'm most surprised by the IBM pick. Barron's called it ""baby Microsoft"" and:

&gt;Under CEO Arvind Krishna, IBM has spun off a pedestrian business of managing data centers into Kyndryl Holdings (KD), refocused on the cloud and artificial intelligence, and vowed to start growing again for the first time in about a decade.

&gt; Wall Street is skeptical about IBM’s prospects, but one bull, BofA Global Research’s Wamsi Mohan, has compared Krishna to Satya Nadella, the Microsoft CEO who transformed the company over the past seven years.
&gt; 
&gt; IBM, whose shares trade around $126, is valued at 11 times projected 2022 earnings. And it has the highest dividend yield in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, at 5.3%.
&gt; 
&gt; If Krishna is successful in boosting sales and margins while making IBM relevant again, there could be a lot of upside in a largely forgotten stock.

Is IBM really a hidden gem or is it rightfully forgotten? Here are the rest of the picks:

* Royal Dutch Shell (ticker: RDS.B)
* IBM (IBM), 
* Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)
* Hertz Global Holdings (HTZ)

# [Stock futures are flat as investors evaluate big retail earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/15/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained after better-than-expected results from Walmart and Home Depot.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow, which contains the two big retailers, added 70 points, or 0.19%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures were slightly in the red.
*****
&gt; Walmart kicked off a busy week of retail earnings by saying third-quarter profit and revenue was well above estimates with U.S. same-store sales jumping 9.2%, excluding fuel. The company also raised its forecast for 2021, saying adjusted earnings per share will be around $6.40 versus its prior expectations of between $6.20 and $6.35. The shares moved slighly lower in premarket trading.
*****
&gt; Home Depot gained more than 1%, however, after its third-quarter earnings beat estimates on a 9.8% sales burst.
*****
&gt; Retail sales figures for October came in 1.7% higher than 0.7% in September, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expected sales to have jumped by 1.5%.
*****
&gt; Industrial production numbers will also be released Tuesday, as well as the NAHB housing market index survey.
*****
&gt; During regular trading Monday, the Dow dipped about 13 points, or 0.04%, for its fourth negative session in the last five. At the high of the day the 30-stock index gained about 136 points. The S&amp;P 500 finished the day unchanged at 4,682.87. The benchmark index moved between gains and losses during the session, at one point gaining 0.3%, while also trading 0.21% lower. The Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.04%. The Russell 2000 was the relative underperformer, declining 0.45%.
*****
&gt; Stocks’ move came as interest rates rose, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note topping 1.62% while the 30-bear Treasury bond rose above 2%.
*****
&gt; Inflation fears are weighing on the market after last month’s consumer price index posted its largest annual increase in more than three decades. Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he believes inflation will moderate in 2022, but that “the path to lower inflation [will] begin with higher inflation in the front half of the year.”
*****
&gt; “The stickier drivers of inflation are likely to persist, but our base case is that they will not outweigh the improvement we expect in the transitory elements,” he wrote in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; On Monday afternoon President Joe Biden signed the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill into law. The package includes funding for transportation, broadband and utilities.
*****
&gt; The major averages are coming off their first negative week in six, but stocks are still trading around all-time high levels. As Wall Street strategists look to 2022 some, including Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson, believe the picture looks muted.
*****
&gt; “With financial conditions tightening and earnings growth slowing, the 12-month risk/reward for the broad indices looks unattractive at current prices,” he said Monday in a note to clients. “However, strong nominal GDP growth should continue to provide plenty of good investment opportunities at the stock level for active managers,” he added. His 12-month base target for the S&amp;P 500 is 4,400, which is 6% below where the index closed on Monday.

I'm aware some companies like Berkshire are so diversified they are said to track total market ETfs fairly well (I think brk:b has a .66 correlation, but it depends on the time period obviously, with the correlation going quite negative at times) nevertheless I would rather a company that passively holds an index fund for several reasons.",92,29,apocalypsedg,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/quen21/is_there_any_stock_that_holds_an_index_fund_as/,quen21

Insurance is a tough business to gain a firm competitive edge in, but ALL is a household name. According to Morningstar, bulls are saying ALL’s move to lower risk profile (away from the coastal hurricane zones) and its increase in prices will help its profits, but bears say its heavy presence in the Midwest still keeps it in big disaster areas. Bears also argue that ALL has a poorer direct-to-consumer channel compared with Progressive (PGR) or Geico (owned by BRK.B), as its Esurance platform isn’t as profitable.

Financially, I’m worried about its debt. Its net debt is up to almost $7.5 billion and has been increasing every year. Meanwhile, its TTM FCF is only $5.2 billion. The dividend is attractive, but I hesitate to buy a company that has more debt than FCF. Compare that with a competitor like Aflac (AFL), which has more FCF ($5.5 billion) and significantly less net debt (only $2.6 billion).",16,11,ZhangtheGreat,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qqt7zc/has_allstate_all_dropped_into_undervalued/,qqt7zc

I'm thinking of increasing my BRK holidng over time with monthly top ups, so it will eventually get to the 60-70% stage. The reason I'm going with BRK is because where I'm based there's a heavy tax on EFTs (otherwise that would have been my route and would have cut out the need for the above). But they are a little light on technology hence why I've gone with those two other picks.

2021-10-21 23:01:59,r/stocks,Trick or $TRIT,"# Spooky part

Spooky season - spooky trades? Let’s talk about investing in **Triterras Inc.**

What can scare a normal investor:

* The company is labeled as **fraud** (by a short report, covered later in this DD)
   * As a result, the company started an **independent internal investigation**, which is ongoing.
* The company **failed to file an annual SEC report** for FY2020
   * The report is being held under review of an **external audit**
   * As a result, the company is hanging on a thread of **delisting** from NASDAQ
* Please take a look at their one-year chart for a maximum **scare.**

Not scared enough? It’s a **controlled offshore SPAC**, with a murky ownership structure centered around the founder/CEO and his buddies.

Do I think you should short it - under normal circumstances - yes... But in this case, it might get you on a trip to the land of pain and suffering.

I think **$TRIT is a powder keg** ready to blow in the face of anyone who wants to touch it.

P.S. Nothing in this post is a piece of financial advice or anything that you should take seriously. Do your own research, size your own risks.

# The Company

So what's it all about?

The company was founded by [Srinivas Koneru](https://www.linkedin.com/in/konerusrinivas/?originalSubdomain=sg) who by the time had a background in commodities trading. The guy noticed a niche to optimize the processes in international trade and make some $ in the process.

The company’s main product is [Kratos ](https://triterras.com/kratos)\- essentially a marketplace for international commodity trading. Think of Amazon or Alibaba marketplace, but instead of retail consumers and merchants you have commodity traders and producers on both sides of the deal, and instead of merchandize you have iron ore and scrap metals.

They cater to underserved communities of SME commodity traders across the globe. This niche was estimated to be 1.5T dollars/year pre-pandemic. I think now you can double or triple this estimate.

They handle all aspects of the trade - discovery, compliance, due diligence, financing, logistics, shipping, etc. It’s done based on Ethereum smart contracts which is the ultimate way to ensure immutability and trust.

So what they are doing is quite amazing - they are essentially carving out the niche for themselves.

They don’t have direct competition, as there is nothing else on the market that allows handling all aspects of commodity trades in a single paperless system for smaller traders.

For the most part, the commodity trade business process is paper and labor-intensive to the point where it becomes prohibitive for SMEs, in addition, banks are not eager to engage with SMEs trade financing, which opens up a large opportunity for smart money to engage in commodity trades by financing traders on Kratos in real-time.

Kratos itself gets a cut on each such trade. I believe their commission stands at 0.3% of goods moved. They also get a cut on financing for trades if they match lender and borrower successfully.

(Big banks ignore this niche due to [the Bazel Accord](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basel_accord.asp) enacted as part of the response to a previous financial crisis that limits banks’ exposure to commodities. It essentially makes big banks cater only to large commodity trading companies)

# Short report and rebuttal

To keep it brief: a suspicious newly formed hedge fund Phase 2 Partners, said it analyzed records and in the short report made the accusation that most of the transactions on Kratos are produced by Rhodium Resources, which is a commodity trader affiliated with the $TRIT CEO. This means that the company lied in their SEC statements and a lot of other unpleasant things. There are additional allegations around the SPAC combination and personal connections between SPAC and TRIT CEOs.

In response, the company rebutted the short-report claims citing coordinated price manipulation, and started 2 independent but related processes: audit of FY2021 financial statements and internal investigation into the short report. My understanding is that both are still ongoing.

Ever since the stock has not been itself, making lower lows after lower lows. And even the most devoted holders start to think about selling. The perfect storm begins.

Naturally, this price action has triggered numerous shareholders’ lawsuits, which I believe are still pending.

During the short report fallout, 2 board members have [resigned](https://www.gtreview.com/news/fintech/triterras-directors-quit-amid-row-over-related-party-claims/) citing disagreement with board decisions.

Official [short report](https://phase2partners.egnyte.com/dl/bZMK5uwx27), but this is a [good summary.](https://www.gtreview.com/news/fintech/triterras-transactions-publicly-visible-on-blockchain/)

Official company [response](https://ir.triterras.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/33/triterras-company-statement-in-response-to-short-report).

Commencing of independent [investigation](https://ir.triterras.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/35/triterras-inc-announces-independent-investigation-by-the).

# Delayed FY2020 report and audit

On June 28, 2021, the Company filed a Form 12b-25 informing the United States Securities and Exchange Commission that there will be a delay in filing its annual report on Form 20-F. The filing is available on Triterras website, Investor Section, under the SEC Filings section. The Company plans to file its 2021 Annual Report as soon as is practicable after the audit is completed by its independent registered accounting firm, Nexia.

It needs to be noted it took a while to assign Nexia as an independent auditor. KPMG (previous auditor) resigned with no explanation, but Kratos later cited conflict of interest in connection to Rhodium Resources. I believe KPMG audited both. All of it pushes the timeframes of submitting annual SEC statements (due on June 28, 2021).

So in addition to investigation and audit, the company has gotten itself into a troublesome relationship with SEC and NASDAQ, which has set the stage for a potential delisting. There really is no excuse for this type of major management misstep, and as a result, added to a HUGE pile of FUD and selling pressure the stock has seen ever since.

[Delisting notice](https://ir.triterras.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/45/triterras-inc-receives-notification-from-nasdaq-related)

[Compliance plan](https://ir.triterras.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/47/triterras-files-plan-with-nasdaq-related-to-delayed-annual)

[Listing extension](https://ir.triterras.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/49/triterras-announces-listing-extension-granted-by-nasdaq)

[Update on audit ](https://ir.triterras.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/51/triterras-provides-update-on-independent-audit-of-fiscal)

Ok, we established the company is hot water and management is probably lacking in some respects, If you feel like it - you can stop right here. And go back to DD on BRK.

# Bright side

It’s not all doom and gloom from this point.

I will try to describe what is known about the current state of the company’s financials, upcoming catalysts, and a variety of positive signals that were ignored by the market. Also, I will explain why, in my opinion, the company can ultimately regain compliance, leading share price to a swift recovery.

# Fundamentals

There has been a great [DD](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4406419-trying-times-triterras-though-opportunity-to-disrupt-trade-finance-too-good-to-ignore) published on Seeking Alpha in February, after the short report. It’s behind a paywall so I won’t be able to rely on it too much. And have to retell part of the story here.

# Business model

Btw if you want to know a bit more about how blockchain is relevant to Triterras I direct you to an excellent summary by S&amp;P: [Blockchain For Commodities Trading: Opportunities in a Digital Age ](https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/featured/blockchain-for-commodities-trading-opportunities-in-a-digital-age) Anyway, let’s talk in a bit more detail about how they make money and look at this slide from their [investor presentation](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1819876/000121390021002643/ea133543ex99-5_triterras.htm).

They charge trade participants twice (at least) - for trade discovery and for financing. So ideally they make 30-160bps (0.3-1.6%) per transaction traded on their platform.

The positive is that the cost of each additional transaction is nearly 0 for them; they don’t have any physical infrastructure like say Amazon or Alibaba, nor do they finance transactions themselves, so low overhead. The only thing they do - provide a software platform and support it.

The platform itself was likely developed by the CEO team while he was at Rhodium Resources (commodity trader) as an internal tool and he decided to spin it off as a separate business once the full potential was understood (correct me if I’m wrong). This would explain the low R&amp;D spending the short report tried to highlight. Additionally, it may also explain the very high margin values. Anyway, from available screenshots, [the app](https://steemit.com/kratos/@bonanza-kreep/kratos-a-commodity-trading-platform-with-user-curated-funding) looks pretty polished and they just keep extending it with somewhat limited resources.

# Growth

Growth in transaction volume directly converts into revenue growth. Following the short report, the company has reiterated [FY2021](https://ir.triterras.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/30/triterras-inc-reports-estimated-results-for-its-fiscal) guidance. While it’s not published yet (pending the audit) I do expect it to be met or exceeded. The company also had a bunch of initiatives to expand into new market sectors e.g. expand traders outreach and implement insurance &amp; logistics modules to capitalize on more trades.

They planned to expand into the insurance business for their trades.

# Financials

The company is **PROFITABLE**. Yes, unlike most of the SPACs flying high today. The company is making money. And pretty good money for an exponential-growth fintech startup. In the year leading to the SPAC merger deal, they made $0.15 per fully-diluted post-combination share.

&gt;Source: [https://ir.triterras.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001213900-20-037256/0001213900-20-037256.pdf](https://ir.triterras.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001213900-20-037256/0001213900-20-037256.pdf)  
&gt;  
&gt;(look for PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED STATEMENT OF PROFIT OR LOSS AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME)

Look at their operating expenses and you would understand that growth in trade volume will result in significant growth in profitability. They are just printing money with not much effort. At the time of the business combination, the company had total assets of around $197M.

&gt;Source: [https://ir.triterras.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001213900-20-037256/0001213900-20-037256.pdf](https://ir.triterras.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001213900-20-037256/0001213900-20-037256.pdf)

While the FY2021 report is still not available, the company did provide us with an [update ](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_a0a6a2f554170a38455a205727eeb84c/triterras/db/1089/9743/pdf/General+Update+_5.18.2021_Final_v2.pdf)on financial conditions in May. My understanding is it’s not been filed with the SEC, so take it with a grain of salt.

This report gives us their CASH position:

&gt;• As of May 1, 2021 the Company’s cash position was approximately $130 million, reflecting the generation of cash through operations and the cash utilized in the previously announced and now completed stock buyback program.  
&gt;  
&gt;• As of May 1, 2021 the Company has no long-term debt.

The market cap is $500M, $130M is just cash, also no debt means **dilution is highly unlikely**. The company just does not need your money.

Also, the company did a share buyback for $50M:

&gt;\- On Jan 18, 2021, the Company announced a share repurchase program of up to US$50 million of the Company’s shares.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- On Apr 20, 2021, the Company completed its share repurchase program initiated on Feb 12, 2021.  
&gt;  
&gt;Total purchases (US$) $49,866,509  
&gt;  
&gt;Total number of shares purchased 6,671,788  
&gt;  
&gt;Average share price purchased (US$) $7.47  
&gt;  
&gt;Total commission paid $133,436

Why would a fraudulent company that allegedly merged with an affiliated party execute a buyback? Also, note the average share price is $7.47. You are getting shares now much cheaper than the company is ready to buy itself back… Do you think they might want to spend some of it $130M on an extra buyback?

Also from the same document:

&gt;**Mergers and Acquisition Activity Strategic Partnership Focus**  
&gt;  
&gt;• On May 17, 2021 the company announced the successful execution of definitive documents relating to the Invoice Bazaar acquisition. This transaction informs the Company’s acquisition focus – to execute transactions that provide significant strategic synergies and/or provides tactical advantages and long-term earnings growth. As an example, the Invoice Bazaar transaction included an earn out provision. *To fully earn the earn out compensation of $ 4 million, Invoice Bazaar is required to generate revenues of $10 million over the next 2 years.*  
&gt;  
&gt;• The Company has a pipeline of acquisition candidates and continues to pursue its acquisition strategy. The Company has a strong cash position and over 6.6 million treasury shares to execute on these potential opportunities to increase shareholder value.  
&gt;  
&gt;• The Company has previously announced strategic partnerships with Marsh, Seven Oceans and Western Union to enhance its product and service offerings. In addition to M&amp;A, the Company has a pipeline of potential strategic partnerships that will potentially increase the strength of its products and services.

I *highlighted* another interesting detail that caught my eye.  They have longer-term performance metrics baked into the acquisition deals. Definitely does not look like an overnight fraud plan.

They also hired a new auditor. ([Triterras Appoints Nexia TS, Member Firm of Nexia International, as New Independent Auditor](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/06/18/2249589/0/en/Triterras-Appoints-Nexia-TS-Member-Firm-of-Nexia-International-as-New-Independent-Auditor.html))

# Price targets

After the short report came out, most of the analysts pulled back their price targets. The only one who kept their target out is B. Riley and it stands at **$9.**  The [SA article](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4406419-trying-times-triterras-though-opportunity-to-disrupt-trade-finance-too-good-to-ignore) I mentioned above runs a pretty conservative post-short-report valuation estimate for a fintech startup based on their scalability and arrives at a fair value of **$12.5.**

# Commodity market boom

As I mentioned earlier, an increase in Trade Volumes passed through the platform leads to a proportional significant increase in revenue and an exponential increase in profitability. How has the commodity market been doing recently? Since the short report or maybe since March/February when the shares (following short report) were traded at $7-$8 apiece?

Can you spot a divergence between the shares of a fin-tech startup whose profitability directly depends on the price of commodities ($TRIT) and the actual commodity price index ($SPGSCI)?

# App Store

An unlikely source of hopium came from Apple today. The SA article I mentioned a few times already features a screenshot on the amount of the number of reviews on the Kratos [mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kratos-trade-finance-app/id1515877737). The current review count stands at 42, it was 21 in February when the SA article was published. These are supposedly platform traders, reviewing the app. And it makes me feel pretty good about platform growth.

P.S. I think the mobile app is a gimmick for them. The main functionality of their platform is on the web. Check out this [older review](https://steemit.com/kratos/@bonanza-kreep/kratos-a-commodity-trading-platform-with-user-curated-funding) for some details.

# New Hires

One of the best pieces of news for the company in the recent past are their new hires. Since the 2 board members left, the company has been on a spree of quality team additions.

* [Triterras Announces Senior Team Expansion](https://ir.triterras.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/39/triterras-announces-senior-team-expansion)

&gt;Peter Karos – Business Development, North America  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Karos joined Triterras in February 2021 as a consultant and is responsible for originating supplier and lending relationships in North America. He is based in Toronto and reports to Chief Operating Officer John Galani.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Karos brings to Triterras more than 25 years of experience in financial markets as well as maritime and commodity trading industries. Since 2013, he has served as a special advisor to Bluewater Acquisition Corp (TSXV: BAQ.P), a Capital Pool Company that identifies, evaluates, and invests in assets or businesses in the maritime/shipping sector. Mr. Karos also serves as an independent consultant and investor for several assignments with private equity funds, hedge funds, and boutique investment banks.

So what I want to highlight:

* First of all. The new CPA/Financial reporting head is a must, given their situation and increasing chances they will pass the audit and release FY2021 results in time. The guy looks solid to me and I hope he would not put his name on the line for a longer dime.
* Former HSBC and Goldman VPs are not easy people to hire, they do their own DD on who hires them. They don’t like to look like fools (although the right salary and golden parachutes fix it).
* I like “North America” and “Business Development” together. That screams “Money” to me.

**Upcoming Catalysts**

Ok, maybe this boat won’t sink. Why should I invest now and not wait longer, maybe more discounts?

Well I believe once their FY2021 report is filed and the audit is complete the price will either move (much) closer to $0 or back to at least $9-10. Based on the audit results.

[Triterras Provides Update on Independent Audit of Fiscal 2021 Financials](https://ir.triterras.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/51/triterras-provides-update-on-independent-audit-of-fiscal)

&gt;While the Company believed that the Audit could be completed by September 30, 2021, additional time is needed for the Audit to be completed.  
&gt;  
&gt;Nasdaq granted the Company an extension to November 1, 2021 to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) by filing its Annual Report on Form 20-F with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. After discussions with the Company’s independent auditor, the Company anticipates that the Audit will be completed in time to allow for the finalization and filing of its Annual Report on Form 20-F by November 1, 2021.

There is an important consideration. November 1 is not a super-hard deadline. In theory, Nasdaq can extend it again into December. From previous extension filing:

&gt;If Nasdaq accepts the Company’s plan, then Nasdaq may grant the Company an exception of up to 180 calendar days from the due date of the 2021 Annual Report, **or until December 27, 2021,** to regain compliance. If Nasdaq does not accept the Company’s plan, then the Company would have the opportunity to appeal that decision to a Nasdaq hearings panel. The Notice has no immediate impact on the listing of the Company’s securities on Nasdaq.

It sure looks like we are on the final stretch of a long winter for this stock. And we have a few outcomes which I consider probable:

* Half-decent audit and great financials. Everything is great.
* Poor audit (the company is a fraud) and great financialsSome resignations, SEC investigations, and other potential fireworks. Price either tanks or stays in the range of $4.67-$6 depending on how bad things are.
* The report is delayed further and the audit extends, no financial report is filed. Share price tanks locally, but there is a hard deadline of December 27 I mentioned earlier. So some resolution would come before that.

# Float

Let’s get to the interesting part.

I would rather agree on a root canal treatment than calculate the float for a stock like this again. The data for float calculation was sourced from the SEC filings from Netfin (formerly SPAC) and Triterras Inc.

First of all, The source data for total float is this [SEC filing](https://ir.triterras.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001213900-20-037183/0001213900-20-037183.pdf):

[https://ir.triterras.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001213900-20-037183/0001213900-20-037183.pdf](https://ir.triterras.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001213900-20-037183/0001213900-20-037183.pdf)

&gt;**Share Capital**  
&gt;  
&gt;As of November 11, 2020, subsequent to the closing of the Business Combination, there were 83,195,869 Ordinary Shares outstanding and issued. There were also 25,981,000 Triterras Warrants outstanding, each exercisable at $11.50 per share, of which 25,300,000 were former Public Warrants and 681,000 were former Private Placement Warrants. The Business Combination Agreement provides that the Sellers will be entitled to receive an additional 15,000,000 Ordinary Shares upon the occurrence of certain Adjusted EBITDA thresholds, see “The Business Combination Agreement—Earnout Share Consideration and Adjusted EBITDA\*” which is incorporated herein by reference.

# Lockup agreement &amp; insiders.

The lockup agreement existed before but expired and the insider shares are unlocked now.

&gt;**Lock-up Agreement**  
&gt;  
&gt;On the Closing Date, we entered into a lock-up agreement (the “Lock-Up Agreement”) with Netfin, MVR Netfin LLC, SSOL and IKON (SSOL and IKON together, the “Sellers”) pursuant to which the Sellers agreed to not transfer, sell, assign or otherwise dispose of our Ordinary Shares, including shares receivable upon exercise of Warrants, they received in the Business Combination prior to (i) three months after the Closing Date with respect to 10% of their Ordinary Shares and (ii) six months after the Closing Date with respect to the remaining 90% of their Ordinary Shares, subject to certain exceptions set forth therein. The foregoing description of the Lock-Up Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Lock-Up Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.3 and is incorporated by reference herein.

The document also lists invaluable insiders ownership post-combination table.

See section MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

This is important. I'm going to refer to this section later.

So you can see that parties associated with **MVR Netfin** own a significant chunk of post-combination business. Interestingly enough none of them have sold as far as I can tell. It might be due to the share price having dropped before the lockup has expired for them. But they have not sold even eligible parts, since no filings on their behalf can be located. Free float can reasonably be decreased by the number of shares owned by these insiders. But I will caution you, it only works until the price is low. As bags get lighter, I can imagine these shares can end up on the market, the inflection point is probably $10/share. It’s a place where I would start getting cautious about these insiders.

# Warrants

As you can see the company has issued a sizable amount of warrants, but they are exercisable at $11.5.  There are 25,300,000 outstanding public warrants and 681,000 private warrants. All are exercisable for $11.50 for one ordinary class A share and have an expiration of 12/10/2025. There are no current lock-ups on these warrants. $TRIT can redeem public warrants at any time for $0.01 provided the underlying price equals or exceeds $18 for 20 days out of a 30 day period. Private warrants are not redeemable. It looks like we should not worry about them until we reach $11.5.

# Insider Bonus

[F-4](https://ir.triterras.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings?form_type=F-4&amp;year=##document-2-0001213900-20-024301-2) also contains a description of an additional performance-based bonus for insiders based on stock performance and EBITDA targets:

&gt;**Earnout Share Consideration and Adjusted EBITDA\***  
&gt;  
&gt;The Business Combination Agreement provides that the Sellers will be entitled to receive an additional 15,000,000 Holdco Ordinary Shares or “Earnout Share Consideration” after the closing of the Business Combination: (i) 5,000,000 Holdco Ordinary Shares on the earlier to occur of (a) the date on which Holdco’s audited financial statements for the fiscal year ending February 28, 2021 become available, if Holdco’s Adjusted EBITDA\* calculated using such Holdco audited financial statements exceeds $35,838,245 or (b) the date on which the Holdco Ordinary Shares trade on the Nasdaq at a closing price greater than $13.00 for 20 trading days within any 30-day trading period during the one-year period immediately following the closing of the Business Combination; (ii) 5,000,000 Holdco Ordinary Shares on the earlier to occur of (a) the date on which Holdco’s audited financial statements for the fiscal year ending February 28, 2022 become available, if Holdco’s Adjusted EBITDA\* calculated using such audited financial statements exceeds $75,901,142 or (b) the date on which the Holdco Ordinary Shares trade on the Nasdaq at a closing price greater than $15.00 for 20 trading days within any 30-day trading period during the two-year period immediately following the closing of the Business Combination; and (iii) 5,000,000 Holdco Ordinary Shares on the earlier to occur of (a) the date on which Holdco’s audited financial statements for the fiscal year ending February 28, 2023 become available, if Holdco’s Adjusted EBITDA\* calculated using such audited financial statements exceeds $125,657,831 or (b) the date on which the Holdco Ordinary Shares trade on the Nasdaq at a closing price greater than $17.00 for 20 trading days within any 30-day trading period during the three-year period immediately following the closing of the Business Combination.

We should not worry about it until the stock hits $13USD or a good report with great EBITDA is published. Which would be a good problem to have.

**13-Fs and institutional ownership**

Using the insider ownership table from this [SEC filing](https://ir.triterras.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001213900-20-037183/0001213900-20-037183.pdf), the fact that no SEC filings indicating insider selling have been filed on behalf of entities listed there and 13-Fs from [fintel](https://fintel.io/so/us/trit). I’m trying to build a profile of insiders and institutions with diamond hands.

There are a few reasons why I classify an institution as diamond hands:

* It’s an investment bank or index fund
* It’s a known long-term investment firm
* They built a position recently after the short report
* They did not sell a single share after the short report
* They have hedged positions with options and are likely to hold through the thick and thin.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Fk9Cr5xZviTP6wjx-Htnh1jmuXaBVtIkygMT4tyji8g/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Fk9Cr5xZviTP6wjx-Htnh1jmuXaBVtIkygMT4tyji8g/edit?usp=sharing)

Please note, it’s not all institutional ownership, but only institutions/insiders who are likely to hold. So we reasonably can decrease the float by a sum of 69,257,790 shares. At this point the free float is  83,195,869 - 69,257,790 (diamond hands). Now, remember the company also bought back  6,671,788 shares (reported in May). Also 8,303,000 record for MVR includes 681,000 warrants. So I cannot really move out of the float So it brings us down to 83,195,869 - 69,257,790 -  6,671,788 + 681,000 =  **7,947,291** shares.

It is our free float by the DFV method.

**Delta-hedging**

$TRIT features significant [open interest](https://ibb.co/vHs02HR) on the call side going into November/December/January 2021. By my calculations market makers need to allocate around **2.2M** shares in delta-hedging based on the available data.

I'm omitting calculations, but the size of interest can be easily checked here:

[https://maximum-pain.com/options/TRIT](https://maximum-pain.com/options/TRIT)

Assuming float is about **8M,** more than 25% of the float should be delta-hedged. If the price crosses $10, this number rises to 60%. [Illustration](https://ibb.co/dJK0BYd)

This can easily trigger a gamma-squeeze on a sudden upward price move.

# Short Interest

Based on [Ortex data](https://ibb.co/rFTLMyV), there are a few aspects of the short interest situation I would like to highlight.

1. Total short interest stands at 2.41M shares, which represents more than 25% of free float by calculations above. A respectable number, but far from where it was a few months ago.
2. The shorts have been covering very actively over the last few months. It’s both good because it’s a bullish sign in general and bad because it’s a missed opportunity.
3. The fact shorts are actively covering also decreases the probability that the company is a total fraud.
4. If you look at the data closely, you can notice how days to cover have jumped recently, while overall short interest is on the decline. The reason for it - the stock became extremely illiquid. Sometimes there are no trades for the full 25 minutes. And when there are some, it’s 100 shares changing hands. Check it for yourself. When I bought 200 shares the other day I raised the price by $0.02 lol. This indicates extreme stress the short may experience if the price goes up. There is no liquidity.
5. FTDs % of daily volume sometimes shoots above 30-40%. Take a look here: [https://sec.report/fails.php?tc=TRIT](https://sec.report/fails.php?tc=TRIT)

Paired with gamma ramp situation, and extremely low liquidity SI looks like a promising catalyst in case of a good news release next few days.

# Conclusion

The company operates on the intersection of 2 major trends in the global economy:

* Improving supply chain reliability
* Adopting cryptocurrencies in real-world applications.

In my opinion, $TRIT represents an asymmetrical risk/reward profile at this point. The stock has been beaten to oblivion and enters a phase of consolidation ahead of significant events. The risks remain and the company can go bankrupt if fraud allegations are confirmed but if it does not happen - it’s going to be a golden opportunity.

There are also distinct upcoming catalysts: filing FY2021 annual report, which I think has good numbers, ending the audit, and lifting a threat of delisting. This is all the company promises to accomplish **before November 1st.**

Low free float, relatively high SI, and a lot of fireworks from a potential delta-hedging make the long-play very appealing. This situation is aggravated by how illiquid the stock is. No one really wants to trade it :)

While I’m obviously bullish on the company, you can tell from my position. There might be some opportunity for interesting straddle option strategies or even short strategies if you find a short thesis more probable.

Apple is leading the way. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google aren't far behind. The purpose of this post is the look at how much more value the top companies have gained in comparison to to the rest of the market. As of market close today, here's the indices:

S&amp;P500, NASDAQ, and Dow are about 1% from its highs while the Russell Index is about 5%. All indices are way off its lows from 52 weeks ago (even more so from the bottom of the 2020 cash). Clearly the indices are doing ok. But what about the stocks in the S&amp;P500?

In this next chart, here's the value companies in the S&amp;P500 have made since 52 weeks ago (again, the gains should be much more than this since the 2020 lows).

**Marketcap valuation gained during the last 52 weeks**

|%|13.86%|3.73%|1.63%|0.44%|0.19%|0.06%|

The total value gained in the S&amp;P500 index since one year ago is $20.93 trillion! The top 5 companies contributed to about 24% of those gains and the top 250 companies contributed to basically all of it (\~86%).

As of right now, the S&amp;P500 index is now valued at $39.38 trillion, so the S&amp;P500 index has doubled in value since a year ago which is absolutely insane. Let's look at the valuations of these companies.

**Valuations of companies right now**

Top 10 includes Tesla, which is about 25% off its highs that's why you see the top 10 is -12% off its highs. Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index. The top 250 aren't doing so bad either. After that, the bottom 250 gets a bit ugly. The smaller caps did gain more overall up until their highs before they retreated.

Now let's look at how much carrying the top companies are doing.

Every 1% move Apple makes as of now, \~$24 is moved and the S&amp;P500 index moved \~0.06%. A 3% move would impact $72 billion dollars in valuation and has a 0.18% impact on the index. Doesn't seem much but the index is valued at almost $40 trillion dollars. Look at how much of an impact these stocks together make.

&amp;#x200B;

|Top 10|0.3%|0.6%|0.9%|
|Top 20|0.391%|0.78%|1.17%|

The top 20 companies can make a 1%+ move if they averaged a 3% increase/decrease.

So what should I get out of this?

* The S&amp;P500 is top heavy - 23% of its valuation comes from the top 5 companies. 55% of its valuation from the top 50 companies. Almost 90% from the top 250 companies.
* S&amp;P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them.
* Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD.
* Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down.
* Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season.

2021-05-19 22:54:56,r/stocks,"Here is a Stock Market Recap for today Wednesday, May 19, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 19, 2021**

The stock market opened deep in the red but managed to climb throughout the session to pare much of the losses. For example, the Nasdaq (QQQ) opened 1.73% down but managed to close the day 0.12% up. Despite the market declining modestly the last three days, it is encouraging to see volatility decreasing this week  after the wild swings the market experienced in the last few weeks. As said before, I thought the initial sell-off after the April Consumer Price Index was released was overblown for several reasons and am encouraged by this week’s price action.  

Leadership in equity markets has see-sawed between cyclical and value stocks and technology stocks, as market participants weigh the prospects for a strong economic rebound as the US economy continues to reopen with the possibility that the pick-up in activity may generate a surge in inflation. After leading the market higher in April, in the last month, the Nasdaq is down 4.77% compared to 0.79% down in the S&amp;P 500. In my view, this dip could represent a great opportunity given earnings have been extremely strong and many companies have significantly raised guidance moving forward. 

The Federal Reserve released its April Meeting Minutes (basically a written record of what happened in the meeting), which said that “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals” and reiterated, for like the millionth time, that they did not believe a near-term adjustment of monetary policy was needed. Much of the recent volatility in the market is due to investors afraid that a surge in inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy, so hopefully this commentary by the Fed can calm things down. [Read the entire meeting minutes here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210428.pdf)

However, it is important to note, the minutes covered the meeting before the release of the April Jobs Report, which came in much weaker than expected (which bolsters the Fed’s argument that employment remains far from their goal) and the Consumer Price Index, which showed a greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices. That said, the recent reports are extremely unlikely to change the Fed’s view given Powell and other monetary officials have said they expect any inflation to be “transitory” and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before adjustments to the current policy are considered.

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Moreover, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” Finally, the April Job Report, which showed the economy gained only 266,000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March, bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

**Highlights**

* After declining in recent weeks, the sell-off in cryptocurrencies across the board intensified, with Bitcoin (BTC) falling below $40,000 after the People Bank of China (PBOC) doubled down on it’s stance and released a statement reiterating that digital tokens shouldn’t be used for transactions. The PBOC posted in their official WeChat account, “Virtual currencies should not and cannot be used in the market because they’re not real currencies”. It’s important to note the statement doesn’t have any new regulatory steps, according to Yu Lingqu, a vice director at the China Development Institute think-tank in Shenzhen. 
* Ford Motor (F) is expected to unveil an all-electric version of its bestselling F-150 pickup truck tonight
* The US dollar dipped on Tuesday for the fifth straight session, reaching its lowest level against a basket of currencies since late February on waning fears that inflation spikes could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated, another great sign that inflationary fears are overblown. 
* Nvidia (NVDA) is extending its cryptocurrency mining limits to newly manufactured GeForce RTX 3080, RTX 3070, and RTX 3060 Ti graphics cards. After nerfing the hash rates of the RTX 3060 for its launch in February, Nvidia is now starting to label new cards with a “Lite Hash Rate” or “LHR '' identifier to let potential customers know the cards will be restricted for mining. NVDA offers a separate, specialized mining processor that has the best performance for mining but will not be able to handle graphics. 
* In a Ford factory in Michigan, President Biden promoted his $174 billion plan to promote and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles across the United States and planned to roll-back vehicle emission standards. According to the fact sheet, Biden's plan ""proposes cost-sharing grants to support new high capacity battery facilities in the United States” and backs grants to fund the retooling of shuttered factories ""to build advanced vehicles and parts.""
* Michael Burry, the investor famous for calling the 2008 housing market bubble and portrayed by Christian Bale in the movie “The Big Short”, recently unveiled a huge bearish bet on Tesla.

2021-05-18 22:29:10,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, May 18, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 18, 2021**

Stocks held steady today, with the three major indexes trading within a 0.5% range of the even line. It’s encouraging to see the market holding steady after the volatility experienced in the last few weeks. As I have said before, I thought the initial reaction to the April Consumer Price Index, where technology stocks sank and the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 4%, was overblown for a few reasons that will be explained below. 

Last week, the market tumbled in the largest loss since February after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the April Consumer and Producer Price indexes, which showed a larger increase than expected.  The CPI, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

The PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year.

While it’s difficult to pinpoint exact causes, there seem to be several factors contributing to the rise in inflation, none of which I think pose a significant threat to the sustainability of the current bull market.  First, after the collapse in prices during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns, it is not surprising to see prices comparatively much higher than last year as demand and consumer spending surges as the US economy reopens. 

Second are widespread supply shortages and manufacturing bottlenecks in key materials, limiting production capability and driving up delivery time, and as a result, driving up prices. As basic economics shows us, when demand begins to outstrip production capabilities (aka supply), prices inevitably go up. One prominent example of this you may be familiar with is the global shortage in semiconductors, which is causing automobile manufacturers across the industry to limit production. A similar situation is happening across an array of consumer goods. 

Third are historic levels of fiscal spending by the Federal Government in the form of stimulus and other benefits. Federal debt—incurred when the government sells Treasury bonds, bills, notes, and other securities to cover its costs—recently hit an all-time high. However, policymakers are not concerned with the debt at current levels. Jerome Powell said, “Given the low level of interest rates, there's no issue about the United States being able to service its debt at this time or in the foreseeable future.” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview, saying “Even with inflation data coming in hotter than economists expected, long-term bond yields declined, indicating the market has been anticipating inflationary pressures for a while and are reassured by the Federal Reserve’s commitment to move slowly when raising rates.

Now that we understand why inflation may be rising, these are the reasons I think fears are overblown. With the US economy reopening, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.”

I was hoping some more experienced investors could provide some advice for me, a new trader.

I turned 18 at the beginning of this year and created a brokerage account (TD Ameritrade). I put my savings (about 5k) into some ETFs with good dividends, Grayscale crypto trusts, and bought 1 share of ABBV (bought in mid-March), BRK-B, XOM, CVX and REGN (which I bought in early March). I recently put in another few thousand into some tech stocks that fell a lot early this week - CRM, NVDA, BIDU, BABA, XLK, U, along with a few others. My money has grown a fair amount.

So, should I put some more money into tech stocks and other stocks that fell this week? If so, which ones should I have on my watchlist?",84,30,Certain_Cobby03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ndyzxa/is_now_the_time_to_buy_tech_stocks/,ndyzxa

Is there still room to run in these trades and are they sustainable at the levels there at?

I heard that a good deal of the value cyclicals have no earnings or low earnings behind them also.

I mean everyone has poured there money into JPM BRK.B etc, and for years financials have underperformed the market.

What about Cruise Lines, casinos, and the materials sector?

What if cruises don't do that well this summer ? Or casinos?

Are these more or less short term trades?

2021-05-14 20:29:41,r/stocks,Best stocks in your portfolio,"What do I mean by “best”? I’ll let you set your own criteria.

For me, as a very new investor (I’m only a little over a month in, so take my word with a grain of salt), “best” are the stocks that have shown consistent, steady growth and have been minimally affected by losses. At this time, my four “best” stocks are…

4) Costco (COST) - It’s had a few swings in its price, but it’s never dipped into the red. As of this post, it’s gained 6.25% in a little over a month, and it’s already paid a dividend.

3) Goldman Sachs (GS) - I’ve only held this stock for about two-three weeks, but its growth has been spectacular. In researching, I found out it was still undervalued, and man, has it shown. Even when it tumbled, it hasn’t been a nightmarish fall. 6.5% growth already.

2) AbbVie (ABBV) - I knew nothing about this company and spent three days researching it before I bought its stock, and it’s been one of the best purchased ever. It doesn’t grow as fast, but it hardly ever falls, even when the whole market is tanking. Also, its dividend is huge (4.46%). It’s grown 8.35% in almost four weeks.

1) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) - First stock I ever bought. Outstanding, steady growth. Hardly has a down day. 10.8% growth in over a month. The only drawback? No dividends.",108,54,ZhangtheGreat,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ncfhmv/best_stocks_in_your_portfolio/,ncfhmv
2021-05-12 23:51:44,r/stocks,Tradingview clarification,"Hi everyone, apologies if this isn't the correct flair. I don't really know what to flair it as. 

The past few weeks i've noticed rather odd values and charts in my tradingview desktop and phone application. Settings were maintained, none changed.

1. Im either missing the shaded areas for after hours or premarket for various stocks, sometimes the same stocks everyday, sometimes it changes.
2. I was missing an entire day's worth of SPX last week. 
3. Afterhours/postmarket values don't match anyone else I've contacted that has tradingview. I've also referenced other chart/value websites and mine still differs. 

Here are examples from today:

The most notable one was today for Berkshire Hathaway Class A stock. 

[Berkshire Hathaway Class A missing shaded areas for afterhours and premarket. 1 minute chart. The share price is also quite different than every other source I've checked, including friends who have tradingview. Seems like im missing VIX and SPX days on that chart too.](https://imgur.com/SNjpOUX)

[Apple doesn't seem to have that problem today.](https://imgur.com/1d7QFNG)

[Amazon has a problem with today's afterhours and different price it seems?](https://imgur.com/E4y4gQK)

&amp;#x200B;

2021-04-16 16:44:46,r/stocks,"The New Normal - 25% of the S&amp;P 100 companies are &gt;70 RSI signaling ""overbought""","I typically watch the top 100 companies daily. I find it entertaining more than anything. I have the RSI indicator on my watchlist and 25 of these companies are currently glowing red. Home Depot and Lowes top the list at an RSI over 82.

The RSI indicator is my favorite tool and I usually rely on it for entering new positions. It isn't perfect but it will give you better odds of timing your entry/exit points correctly when applicable. If you are unfamiliar a RSI value over 70 is usually a sign that a stock is overbought (let it cool for a few days) and a RSI value under 30 is oversold (it probably won't stay here for much longer). Of course companies like TSLA and other momentum stocks break this indicator all the time. When it comes to the big companies though the RSI level is usually more accurate.

If you listen to or read any stock market advice prior to 2020 you would learn entering a position in a stock at these levels is usually not the best strategy. Yet many people are and new highs continue to get made. Home Depot crossed the RSI 70 mark around the $290/share price 3 weeks ago and sits at $328 today.

We see new high after new high and savings accounts are bloated across the US with cash. The new entry point is yesterday. As others have noted, anything a trader has learned over the years has been completely changed the last 12 months.

I continue to be cautious and constantly regret not putting more cash into the market a day earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: For clarity. I am not saying these companies won't go another 20 percent higher before a pullback! Or to an RSI 99! I am just stating it is something I have not seen in a long time. These are not speculative plays they are the largest stocks per market cap that our stock exchange has to offer. It is a very bullish sign obviously. I also see the index funds running at the same level. I am not a bear or a bull I am just trying to not get caught with my pants down! RSI works really well for swing trading but doesn't really matter if you are planning a long term hold. Good luck out there!

EDIT: If you want to know which companies here is the list. These aren't cherry picked they just happen to be in the S&amp;P 100 (largest 100 companies) index $OEX. These are RSI 69.3 and up. The values move throughout the day. It was 25 of them over 70 at the time of the original post.

2021-04-07 23:10:08,r/stocks,Brk.b - strong yield with a fortress business,"I have been looking back at my investments over the last 2 years and saw that my initial Berkshire buy is up 30%. I bought on 8/5/2019 - $199.60. 

This was a reminder of why I bought Berkshire. The stock is built like a fortress. Layers of successful businesses in their own rights (Geico, Duracell, Dairy Queen, Fruit of the Loom, Helzberg, etc), a healthy stock portfolio and a pile of cash ready to be deployed. While I bought the stock largely as a hedge against big stock downturns, it is a growing behemoth in its own right. 

BRK.B bottomed out last year just under $170, which for me represented a ~15% loss. Much better than any of my other stocks did during the covid crash. So it held the line as I wanted and expected.

But realizing that it’s returned a 30% gain to me in some 20 months is fairly impressive. I think this shows there is real money to be made in safety/hedging plays and that stability can go hand in hand with growth. 

Just wanted to share as I know market uncertainty is a constant and every portfolio needs a strong cornerstone for when the market turns. I also believe Berkshire is positioned to keep growing at a (relatively) slow and steady pace",34,14,Didntlikedefaultname,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mmc289/brkb_strong_yield_with_a_fortress_business/,mmc289
2021-04-07 22:08:13,r/stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, April 7, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, April 7, 2021**

Stocks traded largely flat on Wednesday, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) hovering near record highs, as market participants continue to consider the latest batch of strong economic data and commentary by FOMC members.

This week, market participants have digested a host of better-than-expected economic data, with the March job report blowing past consensus estimates, an index tracking activity in the service sector reached a record level, and The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Thursday its index of national factory activity jumped to a reading of 64.7 last month from 60.8 in February, the highest level since December 1983. The International Monetary Fund upgraded its global growth forecast to 6% this year from the 5.5% rise seen previously, largely reflecting the expectation of quick recovery in the U.S. economy. Moreover, JP Morgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said the current US economic boom “could easily run into 2023” amid the massive fiscal and monetary policy support provided to people and businesses. 

This week, the Federal Open Market Committee have shed light on how monetary policymakers are thinking about the current economic climate. Most important, market participants want to know what conditions would warrant an adjustment of the Fed’s current policy stance and their thoughts on potential inflation. FOMC members noted that the economy was “far from achieving the \[FOMC’s\] broad-based an inclusive goal of maximum employment” suggesting policymakers are willing to maintain their current accommodative stance for the foreseeable future, barring a sharp and unforeseen upturn in inflation or economic recovery.

Looking ahead, we are eagerly awaiting first-quarter earnings season in the coming weeks, with the hope that the reports show corporate profits are growing strongly in tandem with strengthening economic conditions. Deutsche Bank Strategist Binky Chadha wrote in a note “Very near term, we expect equities to continue to be well supported by the acceleration in macro growth, and see buying by systematic strategies and buybacks driving a grind higher. But we expect a significant period of consolidation as growth peaks over the next three months.”

* Shares of embattled EV-company Nikola (NKLA) sank further after the company said its head of fuel-cell development departed from the company.

As you can see, its revenue is growing quite good and the management has said that they expect the growth to continue.

One negative is that, STMP has no debt at all(as you can tell from the interest expense row). One would have expected them to load up on those sweet sweet low interest debt like every other company. But STMP management is highly conservative(that's why they are avoiding guidance, I suppose).

Some of its products have mixed reviews online. But ShipStation and its recent product portfolio have good reviews.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

While some of its products have outdated stacks, they are heavily upgrading their software stack. 1M paid subscribers reached already(churn is low). And with a 77% gross margin, it literally prints money. With net income coming at close to 24%.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

They also serve all the major -commerce players. \*Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google, Etsy, Walmart, Shopify, BigCommerce, Wix, Magento, Square, WooCommerce and others. We integrate with all of the major small business e-commerce tools and accounting software, such as QuickBooks, NetSuite, SAP, Volusion, ChannelAdvisor and others. We integrate with fulfillment solutions, such as Fulfillment by Amazon, ShipBob and others. And we integrate with ERP and CRM solutions, warehouse management solutions and transportation management solutions. In e-commerce generally, the strength of our partnership network for shipping is unmatched.\* -from the latest earnings call.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Note: their exists alternatives(even a partially free one), but they don't integrate well with all providers and doesn't have all the solutions, and as a business customer, not having all the cost savings opportunity is not having an opportunity at all.

While when they terminated their deal with USPS the stock dropped heavily, the current COVID crisis proved that the management was right all along and this was the right choice for them.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

STMP is expanding internationally, and its international expansion is being hugely underrated IMO.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Stock is highly volatile, especially surrounding earnings, this I see as a positive for the Reddit gamblers. But the negative is its low volume.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

It has 90% institutional ownership. STMP could also double its repurchase program up to $120M till August. Very low short interest(no short sq ueeze for you).

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Although I don't trust Glassdoor much. CEO has 90% approval. Negative reviews don't point to too much flaws other than the usual staff. But they have a low diversity score.

And although employees say that they feel like a family, as a result of this, there seems to be some conflicts between STMP lifers and the newer employees.

Management's COVID handling is also praised.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

As a kinda SAAS company, I don't see why you can't invest in it. Especially, when there's rumour of rebranding on the cards.

Also, it's not ATH, unlike some of the other ticker that gets frequently discussed. [CHART](https://imgur.com/a/vDvD8xV)

[For the people confused wth this company does. Here's all the details you would need.](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_13798a9768558fb36c854714f42a4ef7/stamps/db/641/4666/pdf/2021+Company+Presentation+-+Website+%28Mar-21%29+-+FINAL.pdf)

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Also, to add. IMO, long term trend is that more and more sales is gonna go digital and a big portion of this could be filled by small and medium enterprises who would use Shopify, Amazon etc channels to make their sales. STMP simplifies their work and saves them money in shipping and other stuffs like no other company. I would say, this makes them in just the right place in the right time. So, I would say, it's a long hold(a buy it and forget it stock)

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Bearish case: Company executives seem to always dump their shares when they receive options (I know they gotta eat, but still).

Other alternatives could develop that could challenge its position. While they are not doing now, it is still good practice to remember that it is not impossible.

This stock is not for the faint of heart.

Management also seems to be ultra conservative, always preserving cash and stuff. While it is fine for a Japanese company. US stocks tend to get discounted if management does this sort of stuff(think BRK.B).

After some research, I didn't found a way to have a chart adjusted with dividends for the SP500.

I am trying to chart BRK.B against SP500. But as BRK compounds dividends, I should adjust the SP500 with dividends to be fair.

Maybe I am not using the right ticker on TradingView (they have an option to adjust with dividends, split, etc). Or maybe I don't understand the SP500 correctly.

2021-03-09 05:57:34,r/stocks,Buy the dip growth candidates,"Hey y'all,

As the market transitions out of growth and tech stocks and into value, I want to position myself appropriately. these same stocks that have gone done 20-30% in the past two weeks are the same stocks that every wanted to buy a month ago, touted by Wall Street analysts but didn't due to valuation and recent growth fallacy. If you could pick a handful of high growth companies to buy and hold for the next few years, which would they be? Looking back on the March dip, it is crazy to see how cheap some of these stocks got.

I'm aiming for 10x on each pick, obviously there is a high likelihood none of these 10x but, to justify investment with a high risk tolerance and long time horizon it makes little sense for me to buy an AAPL or MSFT-mature growth

Looking back on it, I wish I had bought SQ, ROKU, TSLA, SHOP before they blew up these past couple of years into what they are today,. What, in your eyes are those stocks and why? Sure they could still be SQ ROKU and SHOP and I will continue to add these on red days.

My research has led me to consider the following:

**IPOE** (Sofi), I really like Square and may add it but its market cap is already 100 billion. I haven't done nearly enough DD and would love to hear other's take on it. Little scared the lending side of the company comprises too much of the business but it could give the co a nice backbone to pair with their brand's higher growth components: Galileo acquisition and trading platform

**ROKU:** Love the company, obviously tough competition but seems they are outpacing amazon and changing the way our streaming services are monetized- not sure if we'll ever see 400 billion here but I also really like **MGNI** and the pullback its given us.

**SPTK**: to me, this gives off plug energy vibes. It has a relatively small market cap, approx. 5 billion depending on the day and is a market leader in AI, clean energy. Massive TAM. I could go more in depth but I think its well positioned to grow in coming years.

Next up is **Unity(U) and C3 AI(AI)**: I am grouping these together because both are still extremely expensive based on valuation and are recent IPOs but have lots of long term growth ahead in both their respectable spaces, AR/VR and AI

**TDOC:** Huge fan of Cathie Woods but I struggle to develop conviction in this oen and would love to hear what you guys think of it- was a fan of livongo but it seems like that area of the high flying business has been

**PINS:** lotta potential here, theres a reason MSFT has tried to acquire these guys

**UPWK/FVRR**: As society becomes increasingly postmodern, the gig economy will only continue to expand, pricy now and set for correction as we transition out of covid but am long.

**ARKK, ARKF (any one of the ARK funds really)**: set and forget. Harder to get the exponential gains when portfolio allocation is capped at 10% maximum but still offer great exposure to tech with little worry knowing Cathie is running the show

**ETSY:** niche that not even Amazon can compete w, like the company alot esp after how they crushed earnings. Undeniably a benefactor of covid and could see more pull back

Notable mentions: CRWD, NET, ZM, LMND

In terms of value, I'd consider **BA, BRK-B**",40,14,Glum-Bookkeeper-4104,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m0z7bv/buy_the_dip_growth_candidates/,m0z7bv

2021-02-27 06:57:23,r/stocks,Why equities are just in the beginning of the bull run [Long post],"Wrote this for wsb, but it also goes here, I guess.

TL;DR: This post will try to present the thesis that equities are just in the beginning of the bull run and argues that you should be investing in the stock market right now.

# Premise:

Equities are selling off due to rising [treasury yield.](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/textview.aspx?data=yield) The reason behind the rise of treasury yields are complex.

But let me try to explain nonetheless.

1. People are expecting that the economy will reopen successfully and will have a higher inflation and all that stuff. Now yields being that low, it was slowly getting unattractive as bonds are not necessarily the best investment if the economy goes into full gear as there is less need for safety and [more appetite  for risk assets](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-markets-idUSKBN29Q2NR). Plus, bonds were already at a price where yields  couldn’t have gone any lower(meaning existing bond prices couldn’t have gone any higher). Thus, this lower demand  lead to a rise in yields.
2. This created a feedback loop due to mortgage-backed bond investors selling off their treasury bonds which helped the treasury yield to go even higher. They do it due to convexity hedging. If you have no idea about what I said, [read this one up.](https://www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/convexity-hedging-haunts-markets-already-reeling-from-bond-rout) This has been one of the primary driver behind the recent movement of treasury yield. Overall, this elevated level in treasury yield is unlikely to sustain because the FED continues to abolish the free market and will continue to buy. Thus, the yield is unlikely to rise too much higher.
3. JPow and Yellen has already given us enough indications that they will accept lower rates for a longer period of time. Specifically, until we reach full employment. Thus, they will allow the economy to get hot and also allow inflation to rise if the mean inflation is 2%. These are based on their publicly stated statements, which means it may mean something.
4. Now, consider the scenario, real interest rate will remain negative, the yield in treasury is unlikely to reach too high because of the artificial market scenario. While, we know that ***long term bonds outperformed stocks tremendously*** over the [last 20 years(article data till April 29)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/business/bonds-beat-stocks-over-20-years.html) With long treasury bonds having an annualised return of 8%+, while S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 having only 5.5%+; that was a terrible risk adjusted return for stocks. The same picture emerges for the last 5 years [since 2015(dataset ourdated).](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/long-dated-treasuries-crush-s-p-500-performance-over-five-years)
   1. This whole ordeal is because yield was very high at the beginning of the century. And as yield continued to fall, the bonds rose in price, as is customary. Now, as the yield slightly rises, it quickly becomes more attractive as the yields could fall pretty quickly and increase the bond price. This also attracts more bond investors; as a result, I suspect that yields will not rise too much. Plus, it is a very crowded trade.
   2. As a result of bond having this superb risk-adjusted return, stocks saw huge outflows. According to Cathie Wood, [stocks saw $300B in outflows(excluding repurchases)  since 2018 and bonds saw $1T in inflows.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stocks-arent-in-a-bubble-but-heres-what-is-according-to-fund-manager-ark-invests-cathie-wood-11612958113) So, if there is actually any bubble, it is in the bond market. Think about it for a second. Sure, bonds provided absolutely superior risk-adjusted return compared to stocks, but because of this, everyone and their mother are in bonds. Stocks were like the orphan child in the bigger scheme of various financial markets.
      1. Now, bond yields are rising slightly and the yield curve is normalising, but going any higher is unlikely due to the slow abolishment of free market. In this scenario, we won't be seeing any negative rates, while continuing to experience negative real interest rate; being a bond investor would be painful. If you are a bond investor already, you want the yield to go lower, potentially negative, but that is not happening either. If yields rise, you are losing money. If you are a prospective bond investor, you have to worry if yields will go higher just after you invest with all the inflation shenanigans going on.
5. Liquidity is present in the market. Bonds aren't that attractive, stocks are a good bet in this scenario. Especially with all those stimulus talks and stuff. Inflation is also good for the stock market overall as long as we don't go Weimar republic style. After all, you are duddenly not going to stop buying from AMZN, stop using MSFT products or PLTR products just because inflation is here. Question is, which stocks? I think boomer stocks are your best friend(look for the things BRK buys). And after the whole convexity hedging and yield rising stabilises, buying the dip in the tech stocks wouldn't be a bad idea either(I think).
6. US Dollar has been declining after March. It is, overall, good for the stock market and the global economy in general. For one, it makes it easier for foreigners to buy US stocks and two, it boosts the earnings of our corporations in foreign markets. One could say, EM stocks are a potential good source for risk-adjusted return and I also think the same. Although, short USD have had been a popular, crowded and winning strategy for the last year, one should be careful in doing so as any black swan event could catapult the USD higher. However, in the long run, I suppose EM stocks would also be a good area to look out for. Especially, India seems to be the choice for our lawmakers currently.
7. Rising commodity prices and stuff are mostly due to speculation, and not specifically supply crunch. Some are saying that we will see very high inflation due to supply shortage, which would be bad for the market. But I disagree. We have so many structural deflationary forces within our economy. Stagnating wages, high unemployment, technological innovations, cheap labour based production in foreign countries, demographic challenges etc. Some supply crunch is definitely there, but to say that production won't normalise after demand rises due to reopening and stuff is being wilfully blind.
   1. Some of you may not know that CPI does include rents, healthcare expenditures and stuff based on how much they actually cost us, so, before you comment that the government is manipulating CPI to make inflation numbers low, I would suggest you to read how [and what are the weights of each consumption factors.](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/home.htm) Also, stimulus money hardly increases velocity of money because it doesn't really counter the loss of employment income. Just for clarification, there is lots of asset inflation, for example, bonds are very inflated.
8. Our government is doing a shit ton of deficit financing, from that we can expect they will do everything to stop deflation and inflate away the debts. It is in the best interest of our government to keep borrowing money at low cost and to inflate away the debt. Thus, our government has a huge incentive to keep the yield low, while also allowing inflation to rise. You may think, how can this be a free market if... basically, this is capitalism with USA characteristics. Add to that, direct or indirect beneficiaries of these shit ton of deficit financing is, well, the various companies.

# Conclusion

Using my crystal ball, which cost me $0 to buy, I can say this:

This is what I can say from all the points that I have mentioned. Risk assets like stocks are now more attractive than bonds. USD is accommodative for the stock market. Global economic recovery, especially in EM economies will be good, thus helping our companies. Deficit financing. Inflation will be good for ***most*** stocks. Liquidity is present. Bond yields will also stabilise soon as the feedback loop ultimately stops. No deflation. There is likely going to be real inflow into stocks. Stocks will probably finally outperform long term bonds.

Thus, I think, while we will have lower overall rate of return(just like Munger said) in this decade, yet I think we will continue to have a good bull market for a while. Current panic in the market is nonsensical to me.

^(Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I eat crayons and stuff. This is a casino. Don't listen to a stranger on the internet, please don't. I also have used my crystal ball to predict all those future outcomes.)

Risk of my predictions being completely off the mark.

* Fed decides to increase fed funds rate suddenly for overheating/other events and starts quantitative tightening.
* We do have a huge supply crunch in every sector after reopening and inflation goes to the moon. Yields also goes to the moon.
* Black swan events.
* Think of something yourself man!

Edit: My post couldn’t have been more timely! Warren Buffett has warned quite clearly in his annual letter about the ""bleak future"" for debt investors.

“Fixed-income investors worldwide — whether pension funds, insurance companies or retirees — face a bleak future,” he wrote. “Competitors, for both regulatory and credit-rating reasons, must focus on bonds. And bonds are not the place to be these days.”

2021-02-15 14:49:14,r/stocks,What Is Berkshire Hathaway’s Mystery Stock? Big Investment by Warren Buffett Could Be Disclosed Tomorrow.,"What is the Berkshire Hathaway ￼ mystery stock?

Warren Buffett’s conglomerate could reveal that equity holding when it discloses its stock investments as of Dec. 31, 2020 on a securities filing expected late Tuesday.

Speculation is that it could be Walt Disney ￼ (ticker: DIS), PayPal Holdings ￼ (PYPL), Google parent Alphabet ￼ (GOOGL), Home Depot ￼ (HD), Exxon Mobil ￼ (XOM), or Chevron ￼ (CVX).

When it released its most recent quarterly filing in mid-November for about $250 billion of equity holdings, Berkshire (BRK.B) said that it had made a confidential filing for unnamed investments, stating “Confidential information has been omitted from the public Form 13F report and filed separately with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.”

Berkshire CEO Buffett has rarely made use of a confidential filing in the past decade. The last such one was in 2015, and the mystery holding turned out to be Phillips 66 ￼ (PSX).

The SEC can grant institutional investors confidential status if it agrees that public disclosure would move the stock price and make it more difficult for the investor to complete its buying program in the stock. It is possible that Berkshire will continue to keep the mystery holding confidential. News of a new Berkshire holding can sometimes boost the stock, thanks to the Buffett imprimatur.

The mystery holding could be sizable, at $5 billion to $10 billion.

Gary Black, a private investor and former CEO of both Aegon Asset Management and Janus Capital, surveyed his more than 50,000 Twitter followers and their top choices among four selections were Disney and PayPal.

Black has been an influential bull on Tesla (TSLA), but said last week that he was out of the stock, citing the company’s lack of a clear forecast on 2021 deliveries and the risk of a first-quarter earnings miss.

In recent quarters, Buffett has sold out of Berkshire’s holding in Goldman Sachs Group ￼ (GS), sharply reduced a stake in JPMorgan Chase ￼ (JPM), cut a longtime position in Wells Fargo ￼ (WFC) and bought stakes in a group of drug stocks notably Merck (MRK), AbbVie ￼ (ABBV), and Bristol Myers Squibb ￼ (BMY).

Source: Barron's

I think if Buffett select, it could be stable dividend payers such as xom, cvx and hd. But recent years his 2 managers will most likely pick techs, then googl and some other tech stocks will become target. Disney will be also favorable since it is the best recovery play stock with huge grow opportunity with streaming. What do you guys think.

My question is this. I don’t plan on triggering any taxable events any time soon. I don’t have a really great job. I get by but I live modestly. I’m planning on retirement with this account. I’m long on everything. Is my 25000 in cash better spent in ETF’s and mutual funds or in individual stocks. My AWSHX has been a very steady earner for me, it seems like the way to go but I’m not the brightest crayon in the barrel, I’ve no problem admitting that. I don’t want to squander this 25k on high risk plays but I also don’t want it to not be utilized properly? What do y’all think, about the portfolio in general as well as the 25k to be invested. Any etfs in mind? And I know you’re not financial advisors blah blah blah lol",19,10,Whirlybirds,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ljjjkk/should_i_be_looking_at_etfs_for_long_term_any/,ljjjkk
2021-02-09 14:21:24,r/stocks,Would pouring 100% of my market assekts into Berkshire Hathaway stock basically be the equivalent of owning a well managed mutual fund?," Maybe this question is stupid, and maybe it's been asked plenty of times before, but I'll still ask it. I'm young (early 20s) and make decent money in a very reliable government job that allows me to live below my means without worrying about job security. Because of this, I am able to consistently max out my roth ira and contribute to an additional mutual fund in a seperate investing account. On top of that, I recently inherited a low 6 figure retirement account. I am interested in long term growth and have basically all of this in the S&amp;P 500 for realiability's sake. Here's my question: would transferring all of this into BRK-A or BRK-B shares be the equivalent of holding a diversified, well managed mutual fund, or would it be as dumb as holding all your assets in any other single company?",51,22,whatidothesedays,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lg37bj/would_pouring_100_of_my_market_assekts_into/,lg37bj

Just a quick question regarding BRK.B. Is this stock similar to an index fund replicating the S&amp;P? And if so,  would it be wise to invest in both an S&amp;P ETF and BRK.B or would that not be very diverse?

2021-02-04 17:59:04,r/stocks,BRK Seems Undervalued,"The current market valuations are pretty high historically. There are a number of reasons for that and not making an argument for the overall market being over or undervalued. Much of the valuation is driven by the top of the market, companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. Those three alone make up a market cap of nearly $6 Trillion and have had pretty crazy stock price growth over the last few years. Berkshire Hathaway is the 8th most valuable company on the list sitting at around 550B market cap and has been underperforming the market for a while now. 


By market cap, AAPL is 4.13x as big as BRK. If there was a hypothetical where you could either have the entire company AAPL, or a fictional company that was essentially 4.13 Berkshires, here is what the financials would look like: 

|**In Billions**|||4.12922869|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
||**BRK**|**AAPL**|**Buy BRK 4.1 Times**|
|**Market Cap**| 550| 2,273| 2,273|
|||||
|**Total Revenue**| 279| 274| 1,153|
|**Net Income from Continuing &amp;amp; Discontinued Operation**| 36| 58| 148|
|||||
|**Total Assets**| 818| 324| 3,377|
|**Cash**| 147| 192| 605|
|**Total Investments**| 366|| 1,510|
|**Total Equity**| 429| 65| 1,770|

So for the same price as AAPL, you could get a company with

$1.15 Trillion in revenue vs $274 Billion 

$148 Billion in net income vs $58 Billion 

**$605 Billion cash on hand** vs $192 Billion 

$1.5 Trillion investment portfolio vs $0 (does AAPL have investments?)

$1.8 Trillion balance sheet equity vs $65 Billion 


I know there are differences in the income growth of AAPL vs BRK, however from a fundamentals perspective, it looks like this would be a complete no brainer decision on which company I would want to own. It seems BRK themselves thing this is the case too as they have sold some of their position in AAPL and have been doing record buybacks of their own stock.

Can anyone fill me in on things I am missing or overlooking?

2021-01-20 00:38:52,r/stocks,Anyone investing in BRK.B alternatives?,"I'm brand new to the market but it's pretty easy to see that the monolith that is Berkshire Hathaway could possibly be treated as an EFT in its own right. But due to its size, the historic gains it has achieved will become harder and harder to replicate. 

Not only that, the main man himself is coming to the end of a wonderful career and it introduces a degree of uncertainty. Introducing the need for smaller, younger alternatives.

Does anyone invest in companies as a direct alternative to B.H.? Are there any companies that could be considered as safe (or near enough), with less risk in future? More potential for growth?

Again, I'm pretty new. I don't know if B.H. will be the best option for a long time to come, but I'm young enough that I'm willing to accept a bit more risk.",0,0,steppez,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l0wewi/anyone_investing_in_brkb_alternatives/,l0wewi

*****

&gt; * Stock futures were largely flat, following the worst start to a year since 2016, which was also the last time the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq posted January losses. Although the major averages did finish Monday trading well off their worst levels, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 still posted their largest one-day declines since Oct. 28. The Dow dropped 1.3%, while the S&amp;P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq both fell 1.5%. (CNBC)

*****

&gt; * Wall Street’s attention will in large part be focused on today’s Georgia runoff elections that will determine control of the Senate. Both Democratic challengers, Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock, must beat GOP incumbents, Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, to capture the majority for their party. (CNBC)

*****

&gt; * Senate runoffs in Georgia will shape what Biden can achieve in the White House (CNBC)

*****

&gt; * The Institute for Supply Management is out with its December manufacturing index at 10 a.m. ET, which is expected to fall slightly to a 57 reading. Meanwhile, automakers release their fourth quarter sales figures for 2020 throughout the morning, with analysts surveyed by Edmunds expecting an overall 5.7% drop on U.S. sales compared to the same quarter in 2019.

*****

&gt; * Shares of China Telecom (CHA), China Unicom (CHU) and China Mobile (CHL) were soaring in premarket trading after the New York Stock Exchange said it no longer plans to delist the three Chinese telecommunications giants. It’s a reversal of a decision announced a few days earlier, which had been made in compliance with an executive order signed by President Donald Trump. (CNBC)

*****

&gt; * Carl Icahn, in remarks to CNBC’s Scott Wapner, warned that stocks could face a significant decline in the future and he indicated he was hedged accordingly. “In my day I’ve seen a lot of wild rallies with a lot of mispriced stocks, but there is one thing they all have in common. Eventually they hit a wall and go into a major painful correction. Nobody can predict when it will happen, but when that does happen, look out below,” the billionaire investor said. (CNBC)

*****

&gt; * Wharton’s Jeremy Siegel: ‘Dow could easily tack on another 10% to 15%,’ but warns of a near-term setback (CNBC)

*****

&gt; * British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced another national lockdown for England on Monday, a strict public-health measure he said he hopes will help contain a new, more contagious strain of coronavirus. The U.K. has now reported more than 50,000 new coronavirus infections for seven days in a row, and Johnson said deaths are “up by 20% over the last week and will sadly rise further.” Johnson said he believes the country was entering its “last phase of the struggle” against Covid-19 due to the rollout of vaccines. (CNBC)

*****

&gt; * Germany set to extend hard lockdown as daily deaths mount (Associated Press)

*****

&gt; * New York has discovered its first case of the coronavirus variant initially found in the U.K., according to Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo. While the strain does not appear more deadly, experts have said it appears to spread more easily. It also has been detected in Colorado, California and Florida. Cuomo said he believes the new variant is “much more” prevalent than currently known. (CNBC)

*****

&gt; * New York Gov. Cuomo to propose law making it a crime to skip the line for Covid vaccine (CNBC)

*****

&gt; * Just 1% of Californians immunized amid slow vaccine rollout (Associated Press)

*****

&gt; * The U.S. Food and Drug Administration pushed back on the suggestion to change the dosing or schedules of Covid-19 vaccines, saying the currently available data does not support such alterations. The FDA acknowledged the suggestions were made with the hopes of rolling out the vaccine more broadly to the public. However, with “adequate scientific evidence,” the regulatory agency said it believes changing the dosing amount or delaying the second shot by a few more weeks “may ultimately be counterproductive to public health.” (Reuters)

*****

&gt; * UK is delaying second vaccine shots and it’s proving controversial. Here’s what we know so far (CNBC)

*****

&gt; * Ahead of today’s crucial runoff election in Georgia, Republican Sens. Loeffler and Perdue were recipients of a late surge of donations from the real estate and financial industries. Their Democratic opponents, Warnock and Ossoff, had otherwise held advantages in fundraising during the races. (CNBC)

*****

&gt; * At an outdoor rally in Georgia, Trump declared he intended to “fight like hell” to retain the presidency and appealed to GOP lawmakers to reverse his loss to President-elect Joe Biden when they meet Wednesday to confirm the Electoral College vote. Trump spent much of his speech complaining about his election loss, which he falsely and repeatedly claims he won. (AP)

*****

&gt; * Supporters of Trump are planning to protest the expected Biden Electoral College vote certification with demonstrations Tuesday night and Wednesday in the nation’s capital. The National Guard has been mobilized to keep the peace in Washington. Trump has encouraged the protesters, tweeting Sunday he will be there. (NBC News)

*****

&gt; * The joint venture to disrupt health care created by Amazon (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is being disbanded after three years. Known has Haven, the organization was created with the goal of working to lower costs and improve outcomes in health care. The three companies are likely to collaborate informally in the future on health-care initiatives, but the formal end of Haven may be an indication of how challenging it is to dramatically improve American health care. (CNBC)

*****

&gt; * The chief executive of Qualcomm (QCOM) is retiring later this year and will be replaced by the chipmaker’s president, Cristiano Amon. CEO Steve Mollenkopf, who is 52, took over the job in 2014. His departure comes as the company stands to benefit from the broader rollout of 5G networks. Shares of Qualcomm have gained 96.7% since he became CEO.

2020-12-30 18:28:28,r/stocks,What’s Your Reinvestment Strategy?,"What’s your strategy when you want to reinvest gains? 

E.g. I want to sell $15-45k of current stock (GPN) at a market high, with the goal of diversifying into blue chips specifically (MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, BRK.B). 

Do you reinvest your gains immediately for the stocks you’ve been eyeing (which are all high aka selling high, buying high), or do you let the money sit in your account, to be invested during economic downturn, or intermittently as fit?

Adding the following for clarity: I’m familiar with DCA and L-SI; that said, what’s your go-to method? One, the other, or a hybrid of both?",2,0,IllustriousDelay4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kn6ie6/whats_your_reinvestment_strategy/,kn6ie6
2020-12-18 05:00:09,r/stocks,How to approach making my long term portfolio?,"So after 2 years of struggling as a day trader I have finally become very consistent and I want to start withdrawing weekly to start building a long term portfolio but I don’t know how to approach it. So my list of assets which isn’t final yet is as follows:

SPY
KO
PSA
VZ
BRK/B
TD
T
GS

The largest chunk of the portfolio is planned to be SPY but I don’t know how to approach buying into them. SPY is currently so high and I don’t know if I should be worried about current price if I plan to build this portfolio for decades. My current plan was to take out 2000 from my trading account at a time and distribute it among my list(SPY, KO, BRK/B, and GS taking up more of the 1400 than the rest). Is this the right way to approach it or should I only be adding to the portfolio well prices fall?",3,0,PykeTheTitan,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kfdmhn/how_to_approach_making_my_long_term_portfolio/,kfdmhn
2020-11-26 15:39:35,r/stocks,Tesla has surged past $525 billion in market value and could soon overtake Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Here's why that's astounding,"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-market-capitalization-warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-2020-11?amp

Buffett's company earned $255 billion in revenue and booked $73 billion in investment gains last year, fueling $81 billion in net income. Moreover, it held $137 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of March — enough to buy Tesla in its entirety at the time, as its market value had tumbled below $100 billion during the coronavirus crash.

Meanwhile, Tesla had about 48,000 full-time workers last year, less than an eighth of Berkshire's workforce. It also generated about $25 billion in sales — a tenth of Berkshire's revenue — and posted a $900 million net loss. Musk's company also had only $6.6 billion in net assets last year, less than 1/60th of Berkshire's $425 billion.

update: tesla market cap 544 B vs brk-b 547 B now.

2020-10-29 20:17:55,r/stocks,Holding a index fund with QQQ question.,"Hello, I made my Fidelity Roth IRA about a year ago but I’m trying to condense and noticed a possible overlay of holding these two together. I do like the FSKAX index fund because I can invest the amount I want but I also love QQQ... The price of each doesn’t really matter to me but I’m just looking for opinions on which one to focus on at age 27.   


**FSKAX Total market index fund: $93.23** (holdings and percentage estimate it holds)  

*AAPL* 6% *MSFT* 4% *AMZN* 4% *FB* 2% *GOOGL* 1% *GOOG* 1% *BRK*.*B* 1% *JNJ* 1% *TSLA* 1% *V* 1%.

**QQQ: $277.89** (holdings and percentage estimate it holds) 

*AAPL* 13% *MSFT* 10% *AMZN* 10% *FB* 4% *TSLA* 3% *GOOGL* 3% *GOOG* 3% *NVDA* 2% *ADBE* 2% *PYPL* 2%.

I am aware of the expense ratios of both, I love the holdings in each and even own some individually in my regular account. Just feel one would be better to focus on and looking for opinions.

2020-10-26 22:41:54,r/stocks,Thoughts on my portfolio,"I began investing in April of 2019. I have done fairly well so far, I am up 70.32% since I began, although admittedly a good portion of my gains came from getting lucky on NVDA. I realized that I was falling into what I see many other millennials doing, and that is investing heavily into big tech, which is looked at as a somewhat overvalued sector as a whole. Recently, I have been trying to diversify my portfolio and set myself up for long-term gain. Here are my current positions:

3.04 shares of Reality Income (O) (9.52% of my portfolio)
1.5 shares of Microsoft (MSFT) (16.55%)
0.17 shares Alphabet Class A (GOOGL) (14.28%)
3.785 shares Coca-Cola (KO) (9.83%)
1.6 shares Disney (DIS) (10.36%)
1.06 shares Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) (11.53%)
1.56 shares S&amp;P 500 (VOO) (25.38%)
2.47 shares iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) (2.55%) (just playing with this one for the election)

2020-10-23 23:38:10,r/stocks,Do people who buy and hold individual stocks for longer than 10+ years have a much better chance of outperforming the market?,"The average retail investor has a ROI of 2% vs the S&amp;P 500’s return of 9.8%.

But this obviously includes people who make a ton of emotional trades. For example people who doubt their choice and liquidate everything when it underperforms in the short term. People who try to time the market. People who sell solid innovative companies too early to “lock in gains”.

And then we’re comparing this to a theoretical person who buys the entire market and never sells.

But what about comparing people who buy and hold their top 5-10 individual stocks and never sell?

So far I tried backtesting this with various blue chip stocks like McDonald’s, Costco, Apple, BRK, google, j&amp;j, WM, GE, Intel and so forth. For 10+ years and almost all of them outperformed the market.

I even tried getting rid of the obvious massive tech winners and just relied on “boomer” stocks like McDonald’s, coca-cola, Costco j&amp;j and GE from 2010-2020 and it just very slightly underperformed the market with 11.71 CAGR vs 12.97 CAGR of the S&amp;P.

But if you do a longer time period of 15+ years the boomer portfolio actually outperformed the market.

Every time I see studies promoting index funds it always compares the emotional retail investor vs the market. Or the fund managers who aren’t allowed to take risk or have to show quarterly results vs the market.

But I think a more fair comparison are retail investors who also buy, hold and never sell vs the market and fund managers with a long term strategy 10+ years such as the ARK ETFs vs the market.",6,2,Okmanl,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jgweg9/do_people_who_buy_and_hold_individual_stocks_for/,jgweg9

2020-09-23 22:00:25,r/stocks,Warren Buffett’s greatest investing mistake was an emotional decision that cost him more than 120 billion dollars.,"“In 1964, Stanton made an oral tender offer of $11​ 1⁄2 per share for the company to buyback Buffett's shares. Buffett agreed to the deal. A few weeks later, Warren Buffett received the tender offer in writing, but the tender offer was for only $11 ​3⁄8. Buffett later admitted that this lower, undercutting offer made him angry.\[16\] Instead of selling at the slightly lower price, Buffett decided to buy more of the stock to take control of the company and fire Stanton (which he did). However, this put Buffett in a situation where he was now the majority owner of a textile business that was failing.

In 2010, Buffett claimed that purchasing Berkshire Hathaway was the biggest investment mistake he had ever made, and claimed that it had denied him compounded investment returns of about $200 billion over the subsequent 45 years.\[16\] Buffett claimed that had he invested that money directly in insurance businesses instead of buying out Berkshire Hathaway (due to what he perceived as a slight by an individual), those investments would have paid off several hundredfold”

&amp;#x200B;

Just thought it was interesting. Investing is more of a test of personality rather than IQ. If you buy and hold onto only good companies (Apple, Amazon, Costco, McDonalds, jnj, Brk, O etc...) you could easily do well for yourself. Even if some of them end up being bad picks like GE. 

But what’s worse than having a bad pick is probably making a single emotional decision. FOMO,  selling a good innovative company early on because you're scared of losing your 1.5-2x gains, liquidating everything because you’re scared of a market crash and so forth.

2020-08-17 16:30:00,r/stocks,If you think the stock market is overvalued,"Many people here on the forums are probably scratching their head on why the market keeps going up. Let me clue you in. It's not really a matter of fundamentals so much at this point in the cycle as it is fear. There is massive risk of inflation right now, hence gold prices and other asset prices. Back in 1980 inflation was at pretty insane levels and they ended up having to raise interest rates to around 20% to reduce inflation. We are nowhere near those levels of inflation currently but could head there, so keep an open mind.

With all of that being said, I would look for companies to buy that would be a hedge against inflation. Not necessarily companies that have already skyrocketed, but maybe companies with a more sound business model that have stood the test of time like Intel, Cisco, JPM,  WMT, BRK.B,  or even gold and silver companies with good balance sheets, lower price to earnings ratios, and other nice metrics. 

The Federal reserve printed around 3 trillion dollars and their balance sheet is at all time highs. This money will eventually circulate among us and continue devaluing the dollar and boosting asset prices until the federal reserve reverses interest rates and puts the rates on an uptrend.

2020-08-11 14:36:48,r/stocks,Why does BRK.A always open/close on even numbers?,"It seems like this would really play into investor psychology. 2,797.31 looks like a terrible place to jump but 2,800.00 seems nice and smooth and fresh. Is it just so old it is allowed to round to the nearest 1/8th or whats the deal?",0,0,pattywhaxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i7r0s3/why_does_brka_always_openclose_on_even_numbers/,i7r0s3
2020-08-11 01:52:16,r/stocks,FOMO all the way,"During the COVID crash in February-March I was   Moved $10000 to my brokerage in hopes of finding good buy ins. I didn’t catch the lows and started adding to my position in MSFT V NTFL and BRK.B. I now still have about $3000 in cash and am thinking of going all in AAPL. AAPL is currently my second largest holding after AMZN so thinking of just adding to it as I like the company, feel they are doing great,and will continue to grow. My gf says to add it to DIS as she feels they are still at a discount and might be better. Any options or ideas greatly appreciated and open to different places to put them.

2020-08-09 18:38:22,r/stocks,Thoughts on BRK.B,"They’ve been on my watchlist for a while and they have been climbing, but that could just be from the 87% profit margin from last year report.

Do y’all think option calls for the end of the month will be worth it? Such as it possibly hitting $220+

That would be close to it’s all time high",16,10,DuyNguyenReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i6mcxc/thoughts_on_brkb/,i6mcxc
2020-08-08 16:11:48,r/stocks,Will BRK crash when Buffet Dies,Title pretty much says it all. Warren Buffet is in his late 80’s and one of the main reasons people invest in BRK in the first place is because of the trust they have in Buffet. So wouldn’t it make sense that if he does a sell off would occur?,36,20,slow_down_more,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i5zro7/will_brk_crash_when_buffet_dies/,i5zro7
2020-07-28 22:43:22,r/stocks,Anyone notice this trend with BRK.B?,"Thinking of increasing my allocation a little more. Everytime the market is red it shoots up. Could be a nice hedge against current market conditions assuming people would flock to it as a ""safe stock"" if they feel the current frontrunners are popping.",21,9,Klutzy_Hamster,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hzmms0/anyone_notice_this_trend_with_brkb/,hzmms0
