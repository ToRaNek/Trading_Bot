Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-11-04 14:02:14,r/AAPL,Apple ($AAPL) Momentum Meets Onchain Flexibility,"

Apple’s stock ($AAPL) continues to show impressive strength, currently trading above all major moving averages. The next major resistance sits near $277.32 (its 52-week high), while strong support holds around $267.50. The chart still favors a push toward the $290–$300 range, but with Stochastics showing overbought levels, a brief consolidation or pullback could happen before the next big move higher.

What’s made trading $AAPL even more convenient for me lately is switching to Bitget Onchain for tokenized U.S. stock access. No more staying up late waiting for Wall Street’s opening bell — I can enter trades anytime, directly on-chain. Plus, ZERO transaction fees and regular rewards make it a smoother, more profitable.

2025-11-04 07:43:41,r/AAPL,1 year ago I sold some AAPL,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/1ghhs6f/thinking\_of\_selling/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/1ghhs6f/thinking_of_selling/)

Roughly a year ago, I sold some of my AAPL position.

10 AAPL at around $228 ($2289).  Immediately bought GOOG with the funds (12.77 stocks as $179.18)

And honestly, just got incredibly lucky.  I remember at the time when I sold, GOOG Dropped hard (I think news broke of the Chrome lawsuit) and I just questioned whether I should have sold or not.

I actually decided to sell some other holdings like SCHD, a bit more AAPL and bought into GOOG again at $165.

I think even now, (and I'm aware I'm lucky that GOOG won their Chrome court case in the best possible way) I think long term, GOOG is still a monster of a company, and really has (and had) a lot of advantages going forward.  

But I am also happy I held onto AAPL, I don't think Apple has done anything too differently from a year ago, but their iPhone and Mac lineup is still amazing, services still kills it, and will be interesting to see what they conjure up in terms of hardware (Apple glasses etc)",29,26,pokedmund,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/1oo0itb/1_year_ago_i_sold_some_aapl/,1oo0itb

It was anywhere between 30% to70 % stock price appreciation. 

I do understand very well that past performance is not a guarantee of future returns.

But if the IPhone 17 turns out to be an upgrade super cycle ( based on early indicators including Apple guidance for December quarter) after a couple of lackluster cycles- would it be reasonable to expect AAPL trading at $350( 30% appreciation from Friday’s close) at sometime during 2026?

2025-11-01 17:44:55,r/AAPL,Apple’s latest numbers say a lot about where the market is right now.,"After i saw how Profit margins slipped to around 24% showing that costs and regulatory pressure are starting to bite, but revenue and earnings growth both picked up sharply this quarter. I can see the tension, growth is there but it’s getting more expensive to maintain.

Even with that, i have seen sentiment around $AAPL still feels confident. Analysts have targets between $240 and $310 and the current price sits around $270, so there’s room for upside if earnings keep holding up. Wedbush and Daiwa even raised their outlooks, which says a lot about how steady confidence remains despite tighter margins.

Insider activity didn’t raise any flags either. Fifteen transactions in total worth about $3.95M, mostly tax payments and a few sales. No anomalies or red signals. It looks like normal quarter end balancing, not a confidence pullback.

Somewhere in between all this, I kept thinking if it makes sense to just add even if it’s a $500 purchase to my holdings on bitget cuz I still have a bit of hope in the research I did, and a quiet backup confirmation from GetAgent. The small conviction makes me want to add a piece, even if the market still feels uncertain.

I like how this performance tied into the broader tech rebound. $AAPL’s earnings alone helped push the S&amp;P 500 up around 0.7%, and it came alongside similar strength from Amazon and Nvidia. That tells me the market’s still pricing tech as the main driver even when margins thin out.

To me, it feels like Apple’s showing what mature growth looks like in this cycle. Costs are higher, sure, but the business still expands, and that’s what’s holding the market tone together. But did you think this might be a good time to take another look at it?",47,12,Feisty-Rhubarb-6718,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/1olskq0/apples_latest_numbers_say_a_lot_about_where_the/,1olskq0

2025-10-31 06:41:42,r/AAPL,Apple Forecasts Record December Quarter as iPhone 17 Demand Surges “Off the Chart”,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) delivered fiscal Q4 results that beat expectations and set the stage for what CEO Tim Cook called the company’s “best December quarter ever.” Revenue rose to $102.47 billion with EPS of $1.85, both ahead of estimates, while Apple guided for 10–12% year-over-year growth in the holiday quarter — translating to up to $137.9 billion in sales. 

The upbeat forecast is driven by the strong global reception for the new iPhone 17 lineup, which Cook said is “off the chart,” despite ongoing supply constraints. Services revenue climbed 15% to $24.97 billion, continuing as Apple’s fastest-growing segment, while Mac sales jumped 13% on robust MacBook Air demand. 

With total fiscal 2025 revenue up 6% to $416 billion and gross margin expanding to 47.2%, Apple enters the holiday season with record guidance, strong pricing power, and renewed momentum in its core ecosystem.",23,1,Material-Car261,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q4-2025.html,1okmkud

2025-10-30 21:48:23,r/stocks,Apple earnings strong beat and ecosystem domination AAPL is heading higher,"I believe the numbers don’t lie and Apple is going up Here’s why I’m bullish

1 Revenue up 10 percent in Q3 2025 to 94 billion EPS up 12 percent to 1.57  
2 Services revenue hit an all time high showing recurring strength in the ecosystem  
3 iPhone sales grew about 13 percent year over year proving demand remains resilient  
4 Apple is investing heavily in AI and supply chain diversification which sets up long term growth  
5 Shareholder returns through buybacks and dividends keep a solid floor under the stock

My thesis  
Apple isn’t just a hardware company anymore It’s a platform an ecosystem a recurring revenue machine With strong services growth steady device demand and clear AI strategy I see more upside ahead I expect AAPL to break above 200 and keep running unless macro takes a hit

Risk side because we’re honest  
Yes China competition and tariffs are still headwinds And sure Apple’s AI rollout lags a bit behind peers But their consistent beat and resilience show the fundamentals are solid

It owns five television channels, including AMC, BBC America, IFC and Sundance TV. It has its own streaming service (actually nine, but who's counting).

At the same time its share price went from ATH of around 80 USD to the current price of around 8 USD, a 90% drop. The market cap is a tiny 340M USD, which is peanuts for any big player like NFLX, AAPL, AMZN, or even WBD or the new kid on the block PSKY, who just bid for WBD.

So, the question is why there's no bidding activity for them? Are the vultures just waiting for it to go belly up and buy the assets on the cheap? Do the owners think that they will turn the business around, and the current price (or even a 3x price) doesn't reflect the true value of the enterprise?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

""The slimmest iPhone of this generation may soon vanish into thin air.

The iPhone Air is reportedly not selling well in most markets, prompting Apple to drastically reduce production orders for the new handset roughly a month after its launch. Citing anonymous sources familiar with Apple's production lines, Nikkei Asia reports that the iPhone Air now accounts for less than 10% of all smartphone orders from the Cupertino company, a significant reduction from its previous 15% share of iPhone production.

One source claims this lower number puts the Air at ""end of production"" levels. ""

Long story short, back in **2018**, Tim Cook told analysts that Apple was facing sales pressure in some countries — but said **China wasn’t one of them**. Just two months later, Apple shocked investors by revealing a **$9 billion revenue cut**, citing weak iPhone sales in China and the impact of trade tensions. Following this news, **$AAPL fell 10%**, erasing billions in shareholder value.

The case, filed in **April 2019**, alleged that Apple and its leadership **misrepresented iPhone demand, concealed the impact of cheaper battery replacements and competition in China**, and downplayed how trade tensions were hurting sales.

Now, Apple has **agreed to settle $490 million** with investors to resolve all related claims.

So, if you invested in **Apple ($AAPL)** around late 2018 to early 2019, you can check the details and [file your claim](https://11th.com/cases/apple-investor-settlement) once the settlement site opens.

These factors have reignited demand, with early sales in the US and China outperforming the previous iPhone 16 series by 14%.  

Key factors in the comeback
Strong sales performance: The iPhone 17 series has shown a significant increase in demand, with overall sales up 14% compared to the iPhone 16 in its first 10 days in the US and China. 

Value-driven pricing: Apple launched the iPhone 17 without raising its starting price of $799, despite including more advanced features. This perceived value has been a major driver of demand, particularly for the base model. 

Hardware and performance upgrades:
A19 chip: The new chip provides improved performance, especially for AI tasks. 
Cooling system: The iPhone 17 Pro models feature a new vapor chamber cooling system that allows for better sustained performance by dissipating heat more effectively. 

Camera improvements: The iPhone 17 series includes upgraded ultrawide and front-facing cameras, moving to 48 megapixels for both. 

Ecosystem integration: The launch is seen as a strategic move to integrate Apple Intelligence more deeply across its devices, enhancing the value of the Apple ecosystem. 

Market response: The positive reception has contributed to a strong market performance for Apple, with its stock reaching a new all-time closing high. ",23,5,Jumpy_Hold_4860,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/1ocq3hl/iphone_17_sales_reinvigorate_demand_and_signals_a/,1ocq3hl

my apologies if this is a stupid question, but this has been driving me crazy this last week.

I've held a decent sized position in the etf $SCHD since around 2021 (someone recommended it here during one of those value stock rotations)... and have not touched it since. Over the last ~6 years I've regularly bought SPY &amp; VTI, and some AAPL, GOOGL, AMD, MSFT, NET, companies i am passionate about and follow intently. 

last week, i transfered some cash into my trading account and decided to disperse it evenly amongst SPY, VTI, and SCHD. Ever since, my Google News feed has been sharing nonstop reports about SCHD from websites like Seeking Alpha, Tipranks, etc... everyday, front and center in the ""For You"" panel. 

I am 100% certain i have done nothing to search, research, talk, text, or do anything inbetween to discuss this beyond just clicking the ""order"" button in the Schwab app once. 

So, how the F does google know about my recent purchase?",31,16,cornelius_cumquat,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1o8oydh/can_brokerages_sharesell_your_trading_data/,1o8oydh

Cook has done an incredible job taking the company from $347 billion to around $3.7 trillion, but we're still sitting at that gap between where we are now and the $5 trillion milestone. The timing feels crucial here, with leadership transition potentially happening in the next few years and Apple facing some real challenges in AI where they're clearly behind Google and Microsoft.

What's interesting is comparing the environments both CEOs operated in. Jobs had the advantage of creating entirely new product categories when competition was less intense, while Cook has had to navigate a much more regulated landscape with antitrust scrutiny and geopolitical tensions. The next CEO, whether it's Ternus or someone else, will need to figure out how to innovate beyond the iPhone while dealing with supply chain complexity and catching up in AI. I'm genuinely curious whether we'll hit that $5 trillion under Cook's watch or if it becomes the first major achievement for his successor.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

[https://www.theverge.com/news/791170/iceblock-app-store-removed-by-apple](https://www.theverge.com/news/791170/iceblock-app-store-removed-by-apple)

The app, which worked like a “Waze for ICE sightings,” let users anonymously report and view nearby ICE activity. Its developer insists the removal was politically motivated, saying Apple caved to pressure from the Trump administration.

The app had over 1.1 million users and surged in popularity after being publicly criticized by officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Apple cited “objectionable content” as the reason for the takedown, echoing its 2019 decision to pull the HKMap app used by Hong Kong protesters. Back then, lawmakers from both parties blasted Apple for bowing to political pressure — and the same debate seems to be resurfacing now.

Critics argue this move blurs the line between protecting safety and restricting speech. Supporters, meanwhile, say apps like ICEBlock could endanger law enforcement.

And while this new controversy unfolds, Apple’s also quietly wrapping up payments to investors as part of a [settlement](https://11th.com/cases/apple-investor-settlement) over hiding slowing iPhone demand in China a few years back (people can still submit claims for it, btw).

And recently I came across a [Goldman Sachs note](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-research/25-years-on-lessons-from-the-bursting-of-the-tech-bubble/redaction.pdf) from back in Apr 2025 that compared this market to earlier “bubble” periods to the dot-com era, Japan in the late 80s, and the old Nifty 50 names.

One table (Exhibits 7) shows the current “Magnificent 7” (AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, TSLA) trading around **23× forward P/E**, while the 2000 tech leaders were at **52×**. 

Another table (Exhibits 8) points out they’re way more profitable and have cleaner balance sheets (ROE about 44% vs 28% back then, and most of them sit on net cash).

Not saying I fully agree, but it’s an interesting comparison.

Following near-term movement of $LION, you'll see 5-10% swings on such LOW volume that it is laughable. I expect on any real news to see this stock doubling at worst.  
  
We have moved up 25% on rumors, and 25% on other company expectations with no direct correlation to $LION.

The thing is, Apple made Apple Intelligence the selling point of its newest iPhone. So when buyers can’t even turn it on, the problem isn’t just technical, it’s existential. You can’t sell the “AI iPhone” and then ship people an iPhone without working AI.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

The decision removes a high-profile labor challenge, even as Apple continues to face scrutiny over labor practices and transparency (like the whole [case](https://11th.com/cases/apple-investor-settlement) against Apple for misleading statements over iPhone demand in China).



**TL;DR:**

* NLRB dropped claims that Cook’s anti-leak memo broke labor law.
* Labor allegations remain around pay equity and workplace suppression.
* $490M settlement tied to misleading investors on China iPhone demand.
* On Jan 3, 2019, $AAPL fell 10% after cutting revenue forecast by $9B.
* Apple stock remains under legal and reputational scrutiny despite strong fundamentals.



So, do you think that Apple is finally catching a break on the labor front, or just dodging one bullet?

2025-09-29 20:02:07,r/AAPL,"$AAPL pulls back slightly, but don’t worry.","Apple dipped a bit today, down around 0.8% intraday. Nothing major, more of a breather than a breakdown. The stock has been riding a strong wave recently with the iPhone 17 demand pushing momentum higher, so this kind of pullback feels pretty normal.

What is interesting is how $AAPL keeps finding ways to stay in the spotlight when people start saying the tech rally is over. Even with today’s dip, it is still sitting near recent highs and holding strong compared to a lot of other big tech names that have been choppy.

Personally, i still hold Apple in my portfolio, but i have also diversified into trading some stock futures on CEXes. It gives me another angle to manage risk and keep exposure flexible while watching how these big names move. On top of that, i am anticipating to enter Bitget’s TSLA event, since it looks like another interesting opportunity alongside my regular stock plays.

Feels like one of those moments where the stock is just consolidating before the next move. Whether you are bullish or cautious, Apple seems to remind the market it is not done yet.

* **📉 Valuation:** Apple trades at a premium. Earnings yield is **2.6%**, earnings-to-price **3.8%**, book-to-price **1.7%**, revenue-to-price **10.7%**, and cash flow-to-price **2.9%** — all indicating limited value and a rich valuation.
* **📈 Growth:** Revenue grew **7.2%**, earnings **2.1%**, and projected earnings growth is **9.3%**. Growth remains positive but shows the company’s maturing business profile.
* **💰 Profitability:** Apple’s strength. Return on equity is **154.9%**, return on assets **29.9%**, net profit margin **24.3%**, and ROIC **47.6%**, all world-class figures.
* **⚖️ Debt Structure:** Balance sheet is strong. Debt-to-market cap is **2.7%**, debt-to-equity **154.5%**, and debt-to-assets **30.7%**, all manageable levels.
* **📊 Momentum:** Momentum is stable and positive, with strong short-term performance (**3M: +24.5%**) and solid medium- and long-term trends (**6M: +17.2%**, **12M: +12.9%**).
* **🧱 Stability:** Revenue volatility (**12.8%**) and earnings volatility (**4.5%**) indicate stable cash flows.
* **💸 Dividend:** Yield is modest at **0.4%** (5Y avg. **0.5%**), but a **15.5%** payout ratio leaves room for future increases.
* **🧠 Analyst Sentiment:** Analysts are neutral (**Rating: 2.0**) with price potential at **-4.8%**.

✅ **Conclusion:** Apple remains a *profitability powerhouse* with stable fundamentals and positive momentum. However, its expensive valuation and moderate growth suggest that **future returns could be steady but not spectacular**.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Analyst Mark Newman argues that Apple’s strategy of keeping Apple Intelligence tasks local to devices such as the iPhone and Mac improves security, privacy, and performance—giving Apple an edge over rivals.

Despite lagging competitors in AI and delays in revamping Siri, Bernstein expects Apple to capitalize on new form factors like Apple Glass and smart rings to expand adoption of AI.

Still, the optimism comes as Apple continues to deal with the overhang of its [$490M settlement](https://11th.com/cases/apple-investor-settlement) tied to misleading investors about iPhone demand in China (they're accepting claims for a few more weeks).

Demand is skewing toward the Pro and Pro Max models, where shipping times have stretched to 18–25 days — longer than last year’s cycle. While the A19 chip brings a 20% speed boost, the phones notably lack AI features, and the China launch of the iPhone Air is delayed pending eSIM licensing.

2025-09-15 18:09:58,r/AAPL,AAPL Update,"**TLDR** \- I'm an Apple Stan and the market's initial verdict on Apple was ""meh"", but we are setup for a powerful Q4. There is strong iPhone 17 demand, an adjusted services strategy, and a supply chain shift (to gain support of Donny Trump).

* **iPhone 17** \-  The market panicked and wiped $112B off Apple's market cap, but that's a classic case of Wall Street missing the forest for the trees. The ""boring"" launch was really a win IMO. iPhone 17 pre-orders and initial sales are strong and the initial stock drop wasn’t about consumer demand...Say it for the folks in the back  ""it was about investors betting on a ""wow"" moment that wasn’t meant to be"". Classic and Dumb!
* **Services Price Hike Is Working (Quietly)** \- Official numbers around rev aren't out, but Apple's strategy is clear and I think it's likely working. The company is raising prices on individual services like Apple TV+ to make the Apple One bundle a no-brainer. And let me be super clear with my thought process here, this isn't about jacking up prices across the board, it’s a smart move to boost ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) and push subscribers toward the more lucrative bundle, all without sparking massive churn. 
* **AI Developments is a Matter of ""When"" not ""If""** \- Long story short is there will be an AI strategy. Apple has never necessarily specialized in building technology, but rather specialized on BEAUTIFUL implementation of that tech.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

So, last year, Apple agreed to cough up $490M to settle a lawsuit from investors who say Tim Cook &amp; Luca Maestri basically sugar-coated iPhone demand back in 2018. Shareholders hace only a few more weeks to file a claim and get compensation.

**Here’s the tea:**

* Nov 2018, Apple told Wall Street iPhones were off to a “really great start” and China was “very strong.”
* Reality? Store traffic in China was dropping, suppliers were told to cut production, and demand was softening fast.
* Days later, reports leaked that Apple was slashing iPhone production by 100k per day.
* Fast forward to Jan 2019, and Apple admits its first revenue shortfall in 15 years, blaming China for most of the $9B guidance cut. Stock tanked 10%, wiping out hundreds of billions in value.

Investors sued, saying Apple knew all this while hyping the story. Apple’s still denying wrongdoing, but now they’re settling to move on. So if you were hit by this, you have only a few weeks left to [submit a claim](https://11th.com/cases/apple-investor-settlement), before they start making payments.

Here’s how her top positions look right now:
	•	NVDA – +$383.51 (+929.05%)

	•	CAT – +$46.53 (+88.01%)

	•	TSLA – +$34.91 (+46.69%)
	•	K (Kellogg) – +$19.03 (+38.07%)

For context, if she had just put the same money into the S&amp;P 500, her account would be worth about $4,320 meaning she’s outperforming the index by roughly +5%. Even better, she’s beating me too since my own portfolio is about 2% below the index, she’s actually ahead of me by about +7%.

My other daughter (5yo) who started hers a year ago with $200 initial and $50/mo is outperforming the index by 4% as well. I give up. I’m hiring them to manage my accounts.

Back in 2018, Apple ($AAPL) was riding high and telling investors that China wasn’t a problem for iPhone sales. Tim Cook even said they were feeling pressure in places like Brazil, India, Russia, and Turkey — but not China. Then suddenly, just two months later, Apple shocked everyone by slashing its revenue forecast by $9 billion, blaming weak demand in China.

That revelation crushed $AAPL stock by about 10% in a single day. Investors then filed a lawsuit, claiming Apple misled them about how badly iPhone sales in China were hit by the trade war, cheaper battery swaps, and local competition.

Now here’s the update — Apple has agreed to settle for $490 million with investors to resolve those claims. The class period runs from November 2, 2018 to January 2, 2019.

So if you held Apple during that stretch, you could [qualify for part of the payout](https://11th.com/cases/apple-investor-settlement).

Any $AAPL holders here who remember that brutal 10% drop back in January 2019?",15,8,JuniorCharge4571,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/1n1ehr0/apple_financial_updates_and_news_on_490m_investor/,1n1ehr0

2025-08-26 23:02:00,r/AAPL,I like the company,"TL;DR - Apple’s been left out of the AI hype, but the next 3–6 months are lining up: iPhone 17 cycle + Services price hikes + aligning AI strategy to existing product roadmap

**iPhone 17 ?? ==&gt;** Apple Intelligence bundled straight into iPhone 17 is the upgrade driver. Supply chain checks already pointing to solid demand, which IMO could be the the start of the next cycle.

**Services price hike is a nice bump** ==&gt; Over 1B subs, Record revenue, And now quietly raising prices across Apple One / TV+ / Music which is boosting ARPU without spiking churn. That’s recurring cash flow and margin expansion in one move, I also like.

**AI Re-Rate Incoming** ==&gt; Yeah, the market ignored Apple’s AI story at first, but thats really been the case for every major product annoucement at apple. As Apple Intelligence actually ships with the new iphone + the iphone 16 and gets real traction, sentiment will shift fast, like will litterly take one release to change this whole lame narrative.

**3–6 Month View**: Stock’s been (somewhat) snoozing while the big names ran to unsustainable levels. Going into q4, we've got hardware + services + narrative all working together.

**Also as a side note, this is really just how I view it. I'm a long term holder and don't care if you agree or disagree, especially the apple haters on here who for whatever reason love to bash even though they don't know the 1st thing their talking about.** A.k.a I don't want to hear your AI interpretation of whats going on.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Something that **China** does, not the United States of America. Requiring a publicly listed company to share **revenue** from **sales** with the state is a slippery slope. What's next, State owned enterprises?

The good: This does provide more certainty to investors and chipmakers worrying about export bans. The price and terms are set and now chip makers can access China and predict revenues more consistently. 85% revenue from china sales is better than 0%

From a 10,000 foot view, this is more of a good thing than a bad thing. It allows US chipmakers to export AI infra and dictate terms. The alternative would be no sales to China, potentially opening the door for China to get a leg up in the AI race and exporting their AI infra to the world.

AAPL jumped 5%+ after announcing their American Manufacturing Program while I watched other chipmakers get absolutely wrecked by Trump's 100% semiconductor tariff threat. What impresses me most is how they're not just blindly reshoring everything - they're keeping the expensive fab work in the US but still outsourcing assembly to stay competitive. Meanwhile companies like Renesas are bleeding because they bet everything on staying overseas.

I've been tracking this trend on tiger and other platforms, and the market is clearly rewarding any company with a US manufacturing story right now. My take? This isn't just about dodging tariffs - Cook essentially just reset the entire semiconductor supply chain playbook. Every other chipmaker is now scrambling to announce their own US plans or risk getting left behind. The crazy part is Apple gets to claim ""Made in America"" while still keeping costs reasonable through their hybrid approach.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-08-08 03:53:09,r/AAPL,AAPL Thesis = Confirmed,"You all know how bullish I’ve been on Apple even when sentiment was weak, but now that earnings are out, the thesis I posted weeks ago is playing out exactly as expected. The post-earnings action just confirmed everything. Position still intact and as confident as ever, **HA suck it H8ters**

**TL;DR:** Apple’s recent underperformance was driven by market-wide AI hype elsewhere, but the fundamentals never wavered. With a record breaking Services quarter, continued execution on privacy-first AI, and a long term supply chain strategy gaining momentum, Apple’s setup has only improved.

**Services = Still ⛽️**: Apple’s Services segment once again proved it’s the most stable part of the business. With $23.9B in Q3 revenue (a new all-time high) and over one billion paid subscriptions, this high-margin, recurring-revenue engine continues to scale. As other companies chase AI monetization stories, Apple is quietly turning its install base into predictable cash flow. This is the foundation of the long-term thesis — and it’s working.

**AI Lag Was the Setup**: While names like Microsoft, Meta, and Google rallied off AI driven beats, Apple was left out of the party. That created the opportunity. Apple Intelligence may not have wowed traders on announcement day, but it’s fully integrated, privacy-first, and designed to drive upgrades, not just headlines. 

**Supply Chain Diversification**: The post earnings macro boost wasn’t just about the top line. Apple committed another $100B to U.S. manufacturing, bringing total domestic investment to $600B. This comes alongside its ongoing shift to India and Vietnam (all part of the same strategic move to derisk from China and reduce tariff exposure). That long term planning is being rewarded now, as the company positions itself to navigate policy and geopolitics better than most.

**Earnings Beat = Thesis Confirmed**: Apple posted $94B in revenue and $1.57 in EPS, beating expectations across the board. iPhone revenue grew 13.5% YoY, Services hit a record, and the company saw a solid stock reaction with follow-through in the days after. The stock’s underperformance wasn’t about the business it was about narratives. This quarter flipped the script.

Apple has over a BILLION super loyal customers who continue to spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars on Apple products. They are stuck in the Apple ecosystem. The customer retention rate has to be 90-95%. Younger generations love Apple products.

2025-07-31 18:38:11,r/AAPL,"Apple's ""Underperformance"" Is The Opportunity","You all know how bullish I am on Apple despite the hate, but here is my updated thesis from my post a few weeks ago. Position is highlighted below

**TL;DR:** Apple's strategic foundation as stronger than ever. Services growth, a privacy-first AI platform, and a diversified supply chain position it for a massive run. Despite short-term headwinds, confidence in the long-term thesis is fully warranted.

**Services = $$$$** Apple’s Services segment continues to be a fortress of stability. With a record-breaking $26.6B last quarter and expectations for continued strength in today's earnings, this high-margin business is growing its contribution to total revenue. With over one billion paid subscriptions, its recurring, high-retention cash flow gives Apple a foundation to weather any market volatility.

**AI Strategy… Only up from here?** The introduction of Apple Intelligence and Private Cloud Compute sets the stage for the next iPhone upgrade cycle. This privacy-first AI platform, fully integrated into the ecosystem, provides a compelling reason for the company's vast install base to upgrade to the iPhone 16/17 series. While a specific analyst estimate of a $5–7B revenue boost by 2026 was not found, the market widely agrees this will be a significant, multi-billion dollar tailwind for Services.

**Supply Chain Diversification** Apple’s strategic shift of production to India and Vietnam is actively de-risking the business from its dependence on China and mitigating future tariff impacts. This move, while incurring some short-term costs, is a crucial long-term strategy that builds a more resilient and geographically diversified supply chain.

Notice how all the companies that wine about trump and his tariffs drop rapidly after earning while those who focus on their own growth zoom. This is a sea change worth noting.

2025-07-30 15:17:13,r/stocks,EURUSD falls to lowest since early July What does this mean for equities and macro?,"With the recent macro situation, this could have a knock-on effect on equities and risk assets:

This morning, the EURUSD fell to its lowest since early July and is currently hovering around 1.0800. That's not a small drop, and a few days ago we were near the top of 1.09.

There are probably a few reasons at the heart of this decline: 

US economic data was too strong 

Q2 GDP was revised upwards to 2.8% (previously 2.3%).

Core PCE (the Fed's most watched inflation indicator) was higher than expected.

These data strengthened the market's expectations that the Fed will “keep interest rates high for longer” and made the dollar stronger.

ECB releases dovish signals 

Eurozone inflation data showed some easing.

Germany's latest PMI data is very weak, recession fears are rising again.

Some ECB officials are starting to sound cautious, and the market expects that rate cuts could start in early 2026 (and there are even suggestions that they could be possible by the end of 2025).

Safe-haven capital is pouring into the dollar 

Geopolitical situations are heating up (e.g. Ukraine, global trade tensions), allowing the dollar to attract a lot of capital as a safe-haven asset.

Meanwhile, U.S. bond yields remain firm 10-year U.S. bonds are close to 4.3%.

What does this mean for the markets?

Large tech stocks and those companies that are heavily influenced by the dollar (e.g., $AAPL, $MSFT, $META) could be under pressure, especially since a good portion of their revenue comes from Europe.

Multinationals (e.g., $PG, $KO, $JNJ) could take a loss in Q3 earnings due to exchange rate losses.

Eurozone stocks (which can be followed via the $EZU or $FEZ ETFs) could be pressured by economic weakness, but a weak euro favors German exporters, such as automakers.

Dollar-denominated commodities (e.g., gold, crude oil) could come under pressure in the short term due to a stronger dollar, unless macro risks push up safe-haven demand, such as gold.

My take?

Short-term weakness in the euro is justified, but the next thing to watch is whether US inflation continues to “stick”, and the Fed's attitude at its annual meeting in Jackson Hole at the end of August. If Powell is hawkish again, we could see EUR/USD fall to 1.07 or even 1.06.

2025-07-29 22:00:01,r/AAPL,AAPL: Will Thursday’s Earnings Justify the Hype?,"Apple reports fiscal Q3 earnings this Thursday after the market closes, and analysts are broadly optimistic:

* Revenue is projected at $89.34 billion, a 4% year-over-year increase.

* iPhone sales are expected to hit $40.23 billion (+2%), with services forecast at $26.82 billion (+11%).

* The average price target stands at $233, about 9% above current levels. Goldman Sachs is even more bullish at $251.

Fall’s upcoming AI features, including live translation, are fueling expectations for an upgrade cycle. If Apple delivers in line with—or above—these expectations, it could reinforce the stock’s recent momentum. 

But a miss, particularly on iPhone or services growth, may undercut the bullish sentiment heading into the critical holiday product cycle.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Revenue from Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Store has accelerated month to date in July, especially in the U.S. and is showing no negative effects so far from the Epic Games v. Apple ruling, according to Morgan Stanley.

U.S. App Store revenue has surged 12.5% year over year over the first 20 days of July, according to Morgan Stanley, citing data from Sensor Tower. This followed 11.5% year-over-year growth in June. Meanwhile, App Store revenue in China is up 7.1% year over year, but down 1.9% in Japan. It's up 21% year over year in the rest of the world.

""If the September quarter ended on July 20th, App Store net revenue would be growing 12.6% Y/Y, tracking 210bps above our +11.0% Y/Y forecast, and translating to 60bps of upside (or ~$160M) to our September-quarter Services growth forecast of 11.7% Y/Y (vs. Consensus estimate of +10.8% Y/Y), all else equal,"" said Morgan Stanley analysts, led by Erik Woodring, in a Tuesday note.

What's more, the investment firm finds that App Store revenue continues to increase despite the recent ruling from the Epic Games v. Apple suit.

""After more than two months since the Apple vs. Epic injunction, we still have not seen meaningful impact on Apple's ability to monetize the US App Store, despite the link-out risk,"" Woodring said.

Siri's still a joke while competitors ship ChatGPT-level features. Analysts openly flag Apple's ""slow progress in AI"" and warn about ""real threats from other tech players.""

But Apple might drop a foldable iPhone in 2026. Reports suggest an ""iPhone Fold"" at $1,800-2,000—the priciest iPhone ever.

We've seen this movie before. Apple enters late, executes better. iPod wasn't first. iPhone wasn't first. Apple Watch wasn't first.

Current price: $211. Analyst consensus: $232-233. Bull case: $294. Bear case: $173. Despite AI concerns, 66% of analysts still rate it a Buy.

The AI lag is real. But a foldable iPhone could flip sentiment overnight while they quietly work on whatever they're really building.

Is Apple actually falling behind, or are we watching the same playbook unfold? Will the foldable distract from the AI gap, or is this time different?",27,21,Top-University-3832,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/1m35z8o/apple_lagging_in_ai_but_foldable_iphone_coming_to/,1m35z8o

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

News: [US CPI Report For June](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-07-15/us-cpi-report-for-june?srnd=homepage-americas)

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)/AMD- NVDA/AMD is now allowed to sell its previously restricted H20/MI308 chips to China after gaining U.S. government approval. This reopens a major demand pipeline and removes a significant geopolitical overhang, boosting investor sentiment around long-term growth prospects. NVDA has hit ATH from this, I'm more interested in AMD today as a trade though just because it's run down compared to NVDA, but I'm interested in seeing if NVDA can break $170. The export clearance marks a shift in U.S. posture toward China and semiconductors and the AI race, suggesting trade tensions are entering a more flexible phase and all that money Jensen ""donated"" to Trump is paying off. This benefits high-end chipmakers, namely AMD/NVDA the most.

[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&amp;p=d)/KC/FXI/all Chinese stocks- The chip export announcement has been interpreted as Trump easing his stance on China, sparking a rally across most Chinese equities. BABA was up nearly 6% premarket, and I'm mainly interested in seeing if we can break daily highs in BABA today, other than that I'm also watching KC, a Chinese datacenter stock. Main risk is that Trump reverses his stance- the TACO trade can cut both ways.

[**MP (MP Materials)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MP&amp;p=d)\- The Department of Defense agreed to buy $400M in MP's newly issued preferred stock, taking a 15% stake in the company last week. AAPL is expected to announce a $500M commitment to MP, signaling ""deepening partnerships to localize critical rare-earth supply chains"" (this was announced on FOX news).

Short duration SMA crossing over EMA on the 1H. $212.50 has been a difficult resistance level. Upcoming earnings are going to drive IV in the options market. It’s gonna be expensive to gamble. 

**Speculation:**
Bloomberg’s opinion piece on Tim Apple got picked up by everyone. COO, Jeff Apple, stepping down even though announced earlier makes a nice timeline to spook people about uncertainty in the ranks. Uncertainty = 📉. Earnings don’t look super impressive and no reason to be excited given the AI failure. What was it last year? T-Bill and chill? Expecting AAPL to push back down to $202.50 before years end. If I’m right I’ll buy in slowly and wait to see if $197.50 looks good.

2025-07-07 18:34:32,r/AAPL,AAPL finally broke out - here's what I learned about timing trades,"We've been watching AAPL coil in that tight range for weeks, and it finally delivered. The breakout above 214 was exactly what we anticipated, and it's a perfect example of why timing matters so much in trading.

The setup was textbook - AAPL had been respecting that daily green fair value gap while forming what looked like a complete triangle pattern. The equal highs at around 214 were obvious targets, and the market strength made it even more compelling. What caught my attention was how the stock maintained its structure despite some relative weakness we saw earlier.

Honestly, I was initially hoping for a deeper pullback to the 61.8% retrace around 186 before the move up. That would have been the cleaner setup with better risk-reward. But markets don't always give us the perfect entry we want, and sometimes you have to work with what you get.

This kind of breakout scenario is exactly where tools like Tiger CBA become valuable. When you spot these setups developing but your funds are tied up elsewhere, having the ability to trade immediately without waiting for settlements can make all the difference. The 7-day interest-free period gives you enough runway to capture these momentum moves.

The key takeaway here is that AAPL's respect for key levels and the obvious liquidity above made this a high-probability setup. Sometimes the market telegraphs its intentions clearly - you just need to be ready to act when it does.",0,0,Simple_Response8041,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/1ltyvve/aapl_finally_broke_out_heres_what_i_learned_about/,1ltyvve

2025-07-07 04:03:33,r/stocks,"Stock market today: Dow, S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq futures fall as Trump targets August 1 for country-by-country tariffs","US stock futures fell Sunday as President Trump and top administration officials suggested country-specific tariffs would take effect on Aug. 1, offering more potential confusion to trading partners but also potential breathing room for negotiations.

Futures attached to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F), the S&amp;P 500 (ES=F), and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) all dropped around 0.3%.

Trump had targeted July 9 as a self-imposed deadline, when his ""pause"" on steep April tariffs would go back into effect. Global markets have been bracing for that potential shock, with the US only having reached deals with the UK and Vietnam, as well as a framework toward an agreement with China.

But on Sunday, both Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trump suggested that while Trump could send out letters this week informing countries of their tariff rates, those duties would not go into effect until Aug. 1.

""President Trump's going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don't move things along, then on Aug. 1 you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level. So I think we're going to see a lot of deals very quickly,"" Bessent told CNN's ""State of Union.""

AAPL, DDOG, BGM, MDB, TEAM, and OKTA could benefit if progress on trade deals helps stabilize sentiment and supports a rebound in both large-cap tech and mid-cap growth names.

Bessent hinted at several possible deals in the coming days, suggesting the focus this week is clarity with 18 major trading partners before setting duties for the 100-plus other countries that the administration has in its sights for trade taxation.

2025-07-03 18:09:23,r/AAPL,Can Apple's AI pivot help it escape last place among tech giants?,"Apple's recent consideration of partnering with Anthropic or OpenAI for Siri development has caught my attention. This strategic shift feels significant, especially as it might signal a pause in their internal AI model development. I'm curious whether this move could help Apple catch up in the AI race and finally bring some innovation to the somewhat stagnant Siri.

From a technical perspective, Apple has seen two consecutive days of gains, breaking above its 50-day moving average. This makes me wonder if we're seeing the early signs of a potential breakout. It's a positive signal that has me more optimistic about the stock's potential, particularly given this technical indicator's performance.

However, I can't ignore the fact that Apple ranks second-to-last among the tech giants year-to-date. This ranking concerns me because it highlights how the company has been struggling to keep pace while the broader market continues hitting new highs. I'm wondering if now might be Apple's time to catch up, and I'm eager to see how these latest developments, including potential AI partnerships, will impact its performance in the coming months.

For opportunities like this technical breakout, I've been using tigerCBA for trading, which is particularly useful when I spot opportunities but my funds aren't immediately available. This trade-first, settle-later approach allows me to better capitalize on market timing.

Overall, I'm cautiously optimistic about Apple's prospects. The combination of Siri's potential AI overhaul and recent price action has me intrigued. I'll be watching these factors closely, as they could be crucial in determining whether Apple can eliminate its year-to-date losses and reclaim market leadership.",12,0,Simple_Response8041,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/1lqtioq/can_apples_ai_pivot_help_it_escape_last_place/,1lqtioq

Apple (Apple) supply chain sources revealed:
In June, Apple began the prototype phase (P1 – Prototype 1) of the foldable iPhone. It is expected that the prototype development process will be completed by the end of 2025, after which it will enter the EVT (Engineering Verification Test) phase. According to this timeline, the foldable iPhone is likely to be launched in the second half of 2026.

Supply chain sources also stated that Apple’s original new product planning included not only a foldable iPhone but also a larger foldable iPad.

As of now, it is expected that the foldable iPhone will be launched first, while the foldable iPad is temporarily shelved. The delay is reportedly due to difficulties in component production (such as display panels), high estimated prices, and potentially low market acceptance.

There have been many rumors about a foldable iPhone in the past, but they have all remained in the “rumor-only” stage. Now that almost all Android brands have already released foldable phones, Apple’s supply chain has finally been activated.

Industry insiders revealed that this product has already been in development for more than 5 years, with the number of design revisions exceeding double digits. Suppliers had remained cautious, but now finally believe it has a “real chance” to reach the market.",27,6,Such-Role-4191,https://i.redd.it/705xet8s7daf1.jpeg,1lpjhug

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

3. The move signals Apple’s intensified push into AI, aiming to acquire cutting-edge technology and key talent through high-stakes M&amp;A.

4. While such a high-premium deal comes with integration risks, it could significantly accelerate Apple’s development of a robust AI ecosystem.

Also, as a side note: what’s even crazier still is that I looked at a forgotten about legacy company called General Electric. They are up a whopping 374.46% over the same time frame not including their dividend.

I would say the only redeeming quality of TSLA is that in this 4.5 year frame their PE ratio has dropped from ~1100 to 200. This just goes to show how much valuation and time matter. A great company can have a wildly inaccurate price and you are left with nothing while it grows into its valuation.

Also worth noting their revenue has been completely flat since reporting Q2 of 2023 while gross profit has fallen by ~20%. Their net earnings per share has collapsed 50% during this time.

Lots of the last 2 years have been when Musk was involved with his politics.

2025-06-23 15:47:17,r/stocks,Opportunities in the short-term market volatility? I'm sharing a low-risk offensive strategy that I've been tracking recently,"Over the past few weeks, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq have been fluctuating repeatedly at high levels. Many friends have said, ""The direction is unclear and we dare not act."" But in fact, the oscillation range is precisely when the low-risk strategy comes into play.

Recently, I have been tracking a simplified version of a strategy that combines range-bound oscillation and breakout following. The core logic is:

After determining the key support/resistance areas in major indices (such as $SPY / $QQQ) or large-cap stocks (such as $AAPL / $NVDA), observe the changes in trading volume and K-line structure.

Place an observation order near the upper edge of the range. Once the volume increases and breaks through, follow to open small positions. If there is a false breakout, the stop-loss is extremely small (usually less than 1%).

Auxiliary indicators use simple moving averages (such as EMA20, EMA50) + RSI divergence to determine whether the breakout is healthy.

Last week, I followed up with a small position using this framework when $NVDA broke through 1100, with a profit target in the 1150 range. The stop-loss is set below 1085, and the risk is very controllable.

I wouldn't say this is a ""sure-win strategy"", but its advantage lies in:

The risk is low, the cost of making mistakes is low, and it does not rely on prediction but only on market signals. It is suitable for volatile markets and the initial trend formation stage

2025-06-20 21:07:19,r/AAPL,AAPL's month-long pullback presents opportunity: Smart AI strategy meets technical breakout setup,"The recent month-long pullback in AAPL has many investors concerned, but from a fundamental perspective, Apple's core competitive advantages remain incredibly strong. As someone who's been actively trading tech stocks, I wanted to share some thoughts on the current situation.

Apple's AI strategy is actually quite brilliant when you think about it. Unlike other tech giants pouring tens of billions into AI infrastructure, Apple has chosen a more measured, device-focused approach. This strategy might seem conservative, but it's actually about observing the entire AI landscape develop. They're letting other companies do the heavy capital-intensive trial and error while Apple can leverage its massive user base to commercialize AI features at the optimal moment with maximum efficiency.

This approach requires patience, but the long-term returns could be much more substantial. Apple has enough capital strength to quickly strengthen any technical gaps through strategic acquisitions when the timing is right.

From a technical standpoint, AAPL is currently sitting at the bottom of its trading channel, which typically presents a solid buying opportunity. Key support levels are holding, and there are signs that a bounce foundation is being built. If Apple does announce a major AI acquisition, I expect the stock could challenge the $275 channel top.

Situations like this - where fundamentals are strong but there's short-term pressure - often require quick reaction capability. I've been using tigerCBA for these opportunistic trades lately, especially perfect for those ""I see the opportunity but my funds are still in transit"" moments. You can establish positions immediately and have a 7-day interest-free period to arrange funding, so you don't miss critical entry timing.

For large-cap stocks like AAPL, technical breakouts often happen very quickly. Having flexible trading tools allows you to better capture these fleeting opportunities.

Apple's AI strategy demonstrates management wisdom, while the current technical setup is preparing for the next rally. For experienced traders, this combination of fundamental and technical alignment is exactly the kind of investment opportunity worth watching.

What's everyone's take on Apple's AI positioning? Any other technical signals we should be monitoring?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

However, management is facing a declining moat from the disruptive growth of artificial intelligence in the hardware space, which poses a price-return risk.

In the last month, the stock price has oscillated between $196 and $202 since the end of May, and is still below the key 50-day SMA of $205.69 and the 200-day SMA of $225.74, indicating that medium- to long-term downward pressure still exists.From a fundamental standpoint, Apple achieved revenue of $95.4 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, up 5% year-over-year Diluted earnings per share of $1.65, up 8% year-over-year, both of which exceeded Wall Street's expectations

2025-06-16 17:47:19,r/AAPL,AAPL technical analysis: $193 is the critical support level - here's my options strategy,"AAPL is sitting at one of the most critical technical junctures we've seen this year. The $193 level has been tested multiple times and represents strong institutional buying interest. A break below could trigger algorithmic selling, potentially sending AAPL back to April lows around $164-169. Volume analysis shows significant accumulation around this zone, which gives me confidence in this support level.

If $193 holds firm, I'm looking at upside targets of $205-207 for the first resistance (previous consolidation zone), with a major target at $220-225 representing the all-time high retracement. In the ultimate bull case scenario, we could see new ATH above $237.

AAPL has indeed lagged the ""Magnificent 7"" recently, but this creates an interesting asymmetric opportunity. The market's perception of ""lack of innovation"" may be overblown - remember, Apple's strength has always been in execution and ecosystem integration, not just flashy announcements. Key fundamental catalysts to watch include iPhone 16 sales data with AI integration driving upgrades, services revenue growth from their highest margin segment, China market recovery signals, and potential new product categories.

Given this technical setup, I'm using a strategic put-selling approach around the $193 level. Using Tiger Options' advanced analysis tools, I can precisely calculate the risk/reward for my sell put strategy. If I'm bullish long-term but want to potentially acquire shares at a discount, this approach makes sense. The platform's P&amp;L analysis feature helps me visualize exactly how much premium I collect versus potential assignment risk, while the Greek analysis shows how Delta and Theta calculations work in my favor through time decay.

The real-time options chain on Tiger Options makes it easy to spot optimal strike prices and expiration dates that align with my $193 thesis. I particularly appreciate the IV screening feature, which helps me identify options with attractive implied volatility levels for selling premium.

Despite short-term volatility, Apple's track record of reinvention speaks for itself. From iPod to iPhone to iPad to Services to Wearables, each transition initially faced skepticism, but long-term shareholders have been consistently rewarded. My base case remains that $193 holds, leading to a strong bounce toward ATH retracement. The delayed rotation into AAPL could actually work in our favor as institutional money seeks value in quality names.

Whether using options strategies or direct equity positions, always size positions appropriately, have clear exit plans for both scenarios, and consider using stop-losses below key technical levels. The beauty of using Tiger Options is that I can practice these strategies risk-free with their $1M virtual portfolio before committing real capital.


What's your take on AAPL's current setup? Are you seeing the same technical signals around $193?

2025-06-13 13:35:58,r/stocks,Barclays: History suggests S&amp;P 500 could mark turning point,"With the S&amp;P 500 now trading at 22 times next-twelve-month earnings, Barclays analysts say “valuation alone may not be one” of the major headwinds facing equities.

“SPX is back to 22x NTM EPS,” Barclays wrote, noting that “30 years of history suggest that current levels could signal bear capitulation assuming EPS growth stays positive.”

Barclays examined three decades of forward returns across valuation bands and found that “while average returns decreased (and the variance of those returns increased) as valuations rose from 10x to about 21x, returns actually improved modestly (and variance decreased) as NTM P/E crossed over 22x, up to about 24x.”

The analysts argued that this range “has typically traded at these levels for sustained periods in the aftermath of fast sell-offs and subsequent V-shaped recoveries (1998 and 2020 being prime examples),” adding that “22x could be a good approximation of where bears capitulate and ’animal spirits’ fuel the chase for additional upside.”

Stocks like AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, BGM, PANW, and FTNT could benefit if valuations remain elevated and earnings growth picks up, as Barclays notes.

They cautioned, however, that “equities could be choppy over the near term as markets await clarity on US fiscal policy,” and that “2Q25 earnings \[are\] likely to feature the first substantive hit from tariffs.”

Still, Barclays emphasized that “we see a limited case for valuation alone as an argument against further upside,” especially if “earnings growth picks up to \~9% in 2026, as we expect,” they wrote.

Barclays concluded that while “several pitfalls from fiscal to tariffs lay ahead for equities,” the market’s current valuation is not necessarily a ceiling.",261,62,Zestyclose-Salad-290,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ladnpi/barclays_history_suggests_sp_500_could_mark/,1ladnpi

2025-06-10 23:15:17,r/stocks,Taiwan Semiconductor’s May sales jump 39.6% as AI demand stays strong,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), the primary chip supplier to Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), reported a 39.6% year-over-year rise in May revenue as clients rushed to stockpile chips amid growing trade tensions.

The company generated NT$320.5 billion ($10.7 billion) in revenue last month. While this marks a strong annual increase, it's an 8.3% decline from April, when TSMC saw a sharper 48.1% year-over-year gain.

Revenue for January through May 2025 totaled NT$1,509.34 billion, an increase of 42.6% compared to the same period in 2024.

Looking ahead, analysts project a 50.3% Y/Y increase in TSMC's second-quarter sales, signaling continued robust demand despite month-over-month volatility.

TSMC chief executive and Chairman C.C. Wei said last week that the demand for the company's AI chips continues to outweigh supply.

Yes, Apple is behind in the AI race. While Google and Microsoft are making headlines with ChatGPT integrations and AI-first strategies, Apple's approach feels... cautious. Maybe too cautious. But here's what the market might be missing: when Apple does roll out AI features, they'll be deeply integrated across the ecosystem. Think Siri 2.0 that actually works, seamless AI photo editing, and predictive text that doesn't suck. Their privacy-first approach could be a differentiator in AI, especially as regulatory scrutiny increases. While others rush to collect data, Apple's on-device processing could become the gold standard.

That $165B+ cash position gives them flexibility to acquire or develop AI capabilities quickly. They've done this playbook before—remember when they were ""late"" to streaming with Apple TV+? The upcoming WWDC could be make-or-break for sentiment. If they announce meaningful AI integrations in iOS 26 or surprise us with AR/AI crossover features, we could see a quick sentiment shift. Historical patterns show Apple often rises before keynotes, then faces the ""sell the news"" pressure.

But if it's just incremental updates and more Memoji features, the AI narrative weakness continues. The risk is real—three consecutive months of decline suggest sustained bearish sentiment isn't just about broader markets.

At current levels, the risk-reward looks decent for patient investors. Being the worst performer in Mag 7 often sets up comeback stories, but timing matters. I spotted this potential entry point last week but my main trading capital was still tied up in other positions. Ended up using my Tiger CBA account to grab some shares around $201—sometimes you can't wait for perfect timing when the setup looks right. The interest-free period gives me breathing room to see how WWDC plays out without the pressure of immediate settlement.

Apple's P/E ratio still isn't screaming ""bargain,"" and macroeconomic headwinds could keep pressure on regardless of AI progress. Consumer spending on premium devices faces real challenges, and even great WWDC announcements might not translate to immediate revenue. But here's the thing—Apple rarely stays down for long. Their execution ability has consistently turned skeptics into believers. The question isn't whether they'll figure out AI, but when.

Apple might be late to AI, but they're rarely late to profits. At $200, I'm willing to bet on their execution ability over their innovation speed. Sometimes the best opportunities come when everyone's writing the obituary.

What's your take on Apple's AI strategy? Too little, too late, or strategic patience paying off?",39,2,Top-University-3832,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/1l81u30/apples_ai_lag_opportunity_or_trap_at_200/,1l81u30

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Zuckerberg Recruits New Superintelligence AI Group At Meta](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-10/zuckerberg-recruits-new-superintelligence-ai-group-at-meta?srnd=homepage-americas)

[**CRWV**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&amp;p=d)\-DA Davidson released commentary suggesting their pro forma had underestimated its debt situation while not properly accounting for borrowing costs. This stock is ridiculously run up since IPO (\~4x it's opening price). Daily setup doesn’t look like a clean short, but watching to see if it mimics CRCL’s recent surge at the open yesterday. Interested in seeing if it breaks the highs ($166). Obviously CRWV has a huge debt load due to their GPUs/training chips, but whether this will actually affect the stock price remains to be seen.

[**TSLA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d)\-Musk/Trump tensions have cooled down and Trump publicly stated that they will keep their White House Starlink. This happened about 30 mins before the close and caused TSLA to shoot up a little, and ASTS/RKLB to sell off. TSLA was extremely interesting the day of the feud, but currently I'm minorly long.

Has been on a tear for the past 3 days, might have topped out yesterday. Wasn't this watching this too closely because I was trading CRCL but still interested to see if this makes a higher leg up. Yesterday was the most interesting day for this and RKLB, but if this breaks highs again today then I'll be interested.

[**CRCL**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&amp;p=d)\-Strong run post-IPO has made this the most interesting stock this week outside of TSLA. Very likely we topped out yesterday but watching for additional momentum.

News from a tech giant, inflation data and earnings from a meme-stock legend are among the highlights of the week ahead in markets.

Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference opens the week with a keynote session from CEO Tim Cook scheduled for Monday. Cook will likely use the event to address the company's new products, services, and partnerships. GameStop could clarify its cryptocurrency strategy on the company's earnings call, set for Tuesday. Key companies in the growing artificial intelligence (AI) market are also scheduled to update investors on their financials during the week.

A U.S. inflation report scheduled for Wednesday could indicate whether President Donald Trump’s tariffs are beginning to have an effect on the economy. The news follows a healthy jobs report Friday.

After markets shook off trade tensions last week to bring the S&amp;P 500 back above 6000, investors will keep an eye on tariffs as Trump’s deadline on trade deals approaches. At the same time, the Senate will continue to work toward passage of Trump’s “Big, Beautiful” budget bill amid increasing criticism from Tesla CEO and former Department of Government Efficiency Chief Elon Musk.

# Economists Look for Inflation’s Impact in May CPI Report

Wednesday’s expected release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be the first look at inflation from May. With a Federal Reserve meeting around the corner, the report could set the tone for the central bank as it faces pressure from Trump to lower interest rates. Fed officials are in their blackout period ahead of their next two-day meeting, which begins June 17.

Trump’s tariffs will be a key topic in Friday’s consumer sentiment report, which dropped for four straight months before leveling out in May. Consumers are consistently worried that tariffs will drive inflation higher, sending the closely watched survey to some of its lowest readings since the pandemic. As inflation has lately appeared in check, the freefall in sentiment may have hit bottom.

# GameStop Reports As It Jumps into Bitcoin Market

GameStop’s (GME) earnings report comes as the video-game retailer dips its toe in the cryptocurrency pool. The company, which fired up the meme stock craze in 2021 with its meteoric rise, announced in late May that it bought $500 million in bitcoin. With its retail video game business in decline, GameStop looks to emulate the playbook of Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR) and other companies centering their business models on buying bitcoin.

AI will be a key theme in other corporate earnings this week. Oracle’s (ORCL) report on Wednesday follows the January announcement that the database software firm would join ChatGPT maker OpenAI and SoftBank as part of a joint venture known as Stargate to build AI infrastructure. Adobe’s (ADBE) report on Thursday is also expected to focus on the company’s sales of AI-enhanced graphics software.

2025-06-07 23:48:59,r/AAPL,NVDA did it so will AAPL,"Very interesting positioning into next week. 
$SPY closed the week right at $600 psychological level, a clean breakout spot.

$AAPL Closed above the apex of the months long triangle wedge = technical breakout 

If WWDC delivers real AI substance, Apple could begin to outperform the market even lead SPY to new highs

Breakdown: why retesting or getting near the upper wedge ($230 area) is critical:

⸻

The Significance of the Upper Descending Broadening Wedge

1. Multiple Touch = Valid Trendline
	•	Apple’s upper wedge line has 2+ major rejection points (circled), confirming its validity.
	•	A third or fourth touch, especially after a breakout from a tighter wedge, is textbook price behavior — the market respects these levels before it decides.

2. $230 is a Psychological &amp; Technical Target
	•	It aligns with the measured move of the triangle breakout.
	•	Also acts as a “magnet” zone where sellers previously controlled, and where institutions may want to re-evaluate risk.

3. NVDA = Patience Before Explosion
	•	NVDA’s price knocked on the wedge ceiling 3x (Jan 7, Jan 24, Feb 18), just like Apple is lining up to do.
	•	Only after testing it enough — and building higher lows beneath it — did NVDA explode above.
	•	Once it cleared the wedge, NVDA never looked back, running over 100% in months.",28,5,rebornyc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l5w58o,1l5w58o

Companies like AAPL NVDA and INTC could see movement due to trade implications. A favorable deal might give these companies the green light for continued business operations in China, potentially boosting their stock prices

Chinese consumer demand could get a significant boost especially for companies with exposure in the region like NKE or SBUX However if the deal falls short of expectations those stocks could take a hit 

 Even though we’re all hoping for a positive agreement the market could react negatively if the deal is underwhelming or doesn’t address key issues like intellectual property or market access. In addition, this trade deal could bring forward inflation concerns if the economic impact is stronger than expected

I'm personally looking at **tech** stocks next week If the deal brings positive sentiment I'm expecting a short-term rally in these sectors However I'm also hedging my bets with some **puts** on broader indices in case the deal disappoints and causes volatility

2025-06-06 15:16:03,r/stocks,WWDC 2025 is next week  Can Apple finally deliver something real in AI?,"Apple’s big developer conference kicks off June 9, and Wall Street is *watching closely* — especially with the AI hype still going strong.

Last year, Apple teased us with “Apple Intelligence,” their own take on generative AI. Big demos, big promises... but not much follow-through. Siri still isn’t GPT-level, and most of the AI features we *did* get have been kind of meh.

So what should we expect this year?

Here’s a quick rundown:

 iOS/macOS/iPadOS are getting a major design overhaul, reportedly inspired by the Vision Pro’s visionOS. Mark Gurman says it’s the biggest visual revamp since iOS 7.

 AI features in smaller doses  like an intelligent battery manager that learns your habits, and live translation for AirPods (finally catching up to Google). But don’t expect ChatGPT-style magic just yet.

 Apple might open its own LLMs to devs, allowing on-device AI apps. That could be a big deal long-term if devs jump in.

 New unified gaming app  looks like Apple wants to get serious about gaming. Still miles away from console-level stuff, but their App Store is already a mobile gaming monster.

Also, the iPhone 17 is rumored to be thinner and lighter**,** and paired with the new OS could help reignite sales in China  where Apple’s been struggling for a few quarters now.

Bottom line: Apple might not blow minds like last year, but if the software updates are slick enough and the AI stuff feels *usable*, it could be enough to get AAPL back in the good graces of investors.",41,8,Amith0072,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1l4s5f5/wwdc_2025_is_next_week_can_apple_finally_deliver/,1l4s5f5

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-06-04 15:34:53,r/AAPL,"AAPL holding strong at $200 support, my favorite big tech play right now","Among all the big tech stocks in my portfolio, $AAPL remains my personal favorite. Sure, it doesn't offer a high dividend yield, but the stability in price movement is what keeps me coming back.
I've been relatively quiet with trading in April and May, but looking back at my transaction history, I noticed I made several sales in the $206-213 range. Based on this pattern, I'm planning my next exit strategy around the $207 mark.

What's interesting is that Apple is the only major tech company that hasn't approached its 200-day moving average and has been somewhat left out of the broader market rally. But here's the thing about Apple - it has this uncanny ability to bounce back when you least expect it. Sometimes when everyone gets tired and starts selling, that's exactly when AAPL decides to moon.
I learned this lesson the hard way last year when I got impatient and sold too early, only to watch it surge afterward. That's a mistake I won't make again.

The $200 level is proving to be solid support, and the back-and-forth action between bulls and bears over the past two months has actually been pretty entertaining to watch.

For those looking to get into AAPL or any other stocks, I've been using Tiger Brokers lately - their platform makes it easy to track these support levels with clean charts and real-time data. Plus, you can start with fractional shares from just $1, which is perfect for building positions gradually around key levels like this $200 support.

Anyone else eyeing this support level for an entry point?

2025-05-29 17:45:06,r/AAPL,AAPL technical analysis: Double bottom at $193 support - realistic path to $225?,"After weeks of consolidation around key support levels, AAPL is displaying some compelling technical developments that merit serious discussion from an investment perspective.

The $193 level has been tested multiple times over recent sessions and continues to hold firm, potentially forming a double bottom pattern. What makes this particularly noteworthy is the quality of price action we're seeing at this level - multiple tests without breaking below suggest strong institutional support, and volume patterns during these tests indicate accumulation rather than distribution behavior.

For the first time in nearly two weeks, I'm observing consistent buyer participation during regular trading hours. Friday's Market-on-Close (MOC) prints were especially telling - these weren't random retail flows but appeared to be institutional positioning. The sustained volume on up moves versus lighter volume on pullbacks further supports this thesis.

From a technical standpoint, $225 represents a logical near-term target. This level aligns with previous resistance zones and represents approximately a 16% move from current support - a measured move that's realistic given the potential double bottom formation. The key risk management level remains $193; a decisive break below would invalidate this bullish setup and suggest further downside.

This potential setup should be evaluated within broader market context. Apple's technical picture needs to be weighed against fundamental drivers including iPhone cycle dynamics, services growth trajectory, and China market performance. Additionally, the current rotation patterns within tech and overall institutional positioning in mega-cap names will likely influence how this plays out.

What's your take on AAPL's current technical setup relative to broader tech sector performance? Are you seeing similar accumulation patterns in other mega-cap names, or is this Apple-specific positioning? How do you factor in the upcoming earnings season when evaluating these technical levels?",11,0,Top-University-3832,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/1kye4hj/aapl_technical_analysis_double_bottom_at_193/,1kye4hj

No Apple, Amazon, or Tesla which are too consumer facing. Have the AI tech behemoths, which are also the true quantum plays. Have insurance companies, contrarian bets, mix of mid cap growth companies which have proven themselves with continuously strong earnings reports, and few crazy growth stories.

**The Rules**: DCA daily, when fear and greed index dumps below 25 then aggressively DCA even lump sum. If a company has more than 2 bad earnings more-so guidance than they're out.

**Good Time To Buy?**: I believe they're all overpriced right now. Will hedge with UVXY calls buying monthlies, selling against the position creating diagonals at various strikes when there's an upcoming binary event which could be negative catalyst.

**Changes This Time**: Am combining timing the market increasing DCA'ing amounts, actively managing based off of ER's/guidance, and hedging against during drawdowns using longer dated uvxy calls.

You have to have patience. It can be quite annoying to wake up and hear the president mention Apple by name for a tariff and the stock go down, but the alternative is under different leadership waking up to the EU fining Apple $3-5 billion left and right or making them pay $14 billion for a tax issue that was settled in court a while back and then retried once a new US administration came in and force Apple to now pay. Apple can make some type of small US commitment and have minimal impact from the tariff threat or raise prices by $100 and offset tariff costs. However, it is much worse to operate a business when the EU is allowed to go rogue under the DMA and fine US big tech every quarter when they need extra funds. They held their fines back to just a couple hundred million recently because they were scared of Trump. Trump basically laid this out Friday how he was not okay with them fining Apple and using them as charity. Also, under the last administration our own DOJ went after Apple on some bogus case that Apple is price gouging. The original iPhone cost the same as an iPhone 16e or 16 inflation adjusted and has 100x the features. Apple hasn’t raised prices on most of the lineup in 5-7 years.

2025-05-24 16:08:11,r/AAPL,The hourly wage cost to build an iPhone in the US would increase atleast %300,"This is going to be a good showdown next week. The article’s just one of many that highlight the issue.  Steve A. Jobs wasn’t kidding when he told Obama those jobs aren’t coming back when asked about this topic. 

Public reporting isn’t highlighting the massive continuing cost hit Apple would take to build an iPhone in the US even after the $30B+ capital to build factories. These stories highlight a *$3,000* iPhone to wow you but at 4x the labor cost alone would crush 48% of AAPLs total profit margin on a continual basis. 

The real story is how and why AAPL has dropped over 6% in the last 5 days. Following the off exchange tape, there are some major transactions that have occurred I suspect to see  FINRA reported end of month and in to June. 

Thoughts on AAPL caving to the Oval Office tariff threats? I’d bet the family farm China would fight like a cat to a bath to keep that manufacturing.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( \^DJI ) fell 0.3 percent. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ( \^GSPC ) also fell about 0.3 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( \^IXIC ) was down about 0.6 percent.

Apple Inc (AAPL) must pay a 25 percent tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. but not made in the U.S., Trump said on Friday, and all three major stock indexes trimmed their losses sharply. The tech giant has begun shifting some of its manufacturing operations to India, while China, home to its main suppliers, is mired in a trade war with the United States. Apple shares fell 3 percent after Trump's tweet on Truth Social.

On Friday afternoon, Trump hinted that the tariffs would apply to other cellphone makers.

Trump told reporters Friday afternoon: ""The tariffs are going to be higher, and Samsung and any company that makes that product is going to be affected, or it's not fair. Again, they don't have tariffs on building factories here. That's why they'll build a factory here.""

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&amp;p=d)\-President Trump has threatened AAPL with a 25% tariff on iPhones not manufactured in the U.S., pressuring the company to shift production domestically. This announcement led to a 3.5% drop in Apple's stock and a broader market sell-off (followed shortly by his comments on Europe). Interested in a short if we break $193 at the open, otherwise more interested in the broad market ETFs. An iPhone made in the US is economically infeasible.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Q2 product revenue guidance of $1.035B–$1.045B implies \~25% growth (from a random SA article I read). Moved close to 20 points from yesterday, watching $200 level. The cloud computing space has essentially exploded due to the rise of AI, I should've seen SNOW would report good earnings mainly because of CRWV's earnings reporting 400% revenue growth. Random risks I'm thinking of in the long term are the stalling of semis production (and even the demand for it), regulatory actions like what happened to NVDA, competition in the data cloud market, etc.

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&amp;p=d)\-OpenAI announced the acquisition of Jony Ive's AI hardware startup for $6.4B. This is the first shot in what I consider the ""AI Consumer Hardware War"" (sorry Humane Pin, you don't count lol). This positions OpenAI to develop a new generation of AI-powered devices and could challenge Apple in the AI space. Stock fell intraday yesterday 2-3%, interested to see if we continue that selloff. Watching the 200 level as well. Apple has essentially fallen flat with AI (Apple Intelligence) and hasn't struck gold recently with any good hardware, we can safely consider the Apple Vision a bust.

[**FICO (FICO)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FICO&amp;p=d)\-FHFA director William J. Pulte called for the provider of credit scores to be more ""economical"" and that FHFA is considering replacing the tri-merge credit score model with a bi-merge system to cut costs. Already long from $1700 yesterday, we're down close to 30% on a remark that thinks a $1.50 increase in its wholesale royalty for mortgage originations is too high. The price change is $3.50 to $4.95 per score (which may lead to other companies raising their prices). This is my personal opinion- FICO's probably not going to be phased out for mortgages lol. Too many financial/credit institutions use it.

[**CRWV (Coreweave)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&amp;p=d)\-The stock has been on a monster run, and I'm interested in the short today. We've gone from \~$50 to \~$120 at the peak premarket, watching $100 level to see if we bounce off it or if we continue selling off.

[**UNH (UnitedHealth)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&amp;p=d)\-Reports suggest the insurer made covert payments to nursing homes to limit hospital transfers, aiming to reduce costs, raising concerns over care practices. I won't include the context because I'm sure all of you are sick to death (this is a joke) of hearing about it from Reddit.

2025-05-21 15:59:51,r/AAPL,"After last week's dip, it's high time for AAPL to bounce back: The AI catalyst we're overlooking","Been holding AAPL for years now and honestly,

Last week's market turbulence hit our favorite stock pretty hard, but I'm seeing strong indicators for a significant rebound. While many are focused on macro factors, I believe there's a technological catalyst that's being severely undervalued in Apple's arsenal.

I've been watching Apple closely, and these three strengths make me bullish despite the recent dip:

1. **Vertical integration mastery** \- They design their own chips specifically tailored to their computing needs, consistently placing them in the top 3 across performance categories. This gives them unparalleled control over their technology stack.
2. **Bold product innovation** \- Apple has never let industry conventions limit their vision. When they commit to a direction, they go all-in, regardless of what competitors might think.
3. **Technological leadership** \- While NVIDIA dominates in certain AI computing segments, Apple has quietly developed the highest RAM allocation available to on-device LLMs at the processor level.

Here's what I think most people are missing - Apple's AI play. That rumored **TigerAI** framework they're developing could be the catalyst we've been waiting for. While Google and Microsoft are rushing to slap AI onto everything, Apple's doing what Apple does best - taking their time to integrate it properly into their ecosystem.

We've seen this movie before, right? Apple wasn't first with smartphones, tablets, or watches. But when they entered each market, they dominated. I'm betting the same happens with AI.

I actually added more shares yesterday. This dip doesn't change my long-term outlook - if anything, with what they're building with TigerAI, I'm more confident than ever.

What do you guys think? Am I overhyping their AI potential or is this the real deal that'll push us back to ATHs?",27,7,Dapper_Edge3516,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/1kryjb1/after_last_weeks_dip_its_high_time_for_aapl_to/,1kryjb1

(Bloomberg) — Chinese shipments of Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) iPhone and other mobile devices to the US dived to their lowest levels since 2011 in April, underscoring how the threat of US tariffs choked off the flow of big-ticket goods between the world’s two largest economies.

Smartphone exports slid 72% to just under $700 million last month, sharply outpacing an overall 21% drop in Chinese shipments to the US, detailed customs data showed on Tuesday. That highlighted the way the Trump administration’s tariffs campaign — peaking with 145% levies on Chinese goods — is disrupting tech supply chains and diverting electronics elsewhere.

Investors fear a global trade war that would erode some of the US-China bilateral trade that reached $690 billion in 2024, decimating industries and raising prices for consumers. Tensions remain high: Beijing this week accused the Trump administration of undermining recent trade talks in Geneva by pursuing sanctions on Huawei Technologies Co.’s artificial intelligence chips.

Last year, the three biggest US imports from China were smartphones, laptops and lithium-ion batteries, while liquid petroleum gas, oil, soybeans, gas turbines, and machines to make semiconductors were some of the most valuable US exports to China.

The value of phone component exports to India — home to Apple’s biggest iPhone production base outside of China — roughly quadrupled over the course of the past year, according to China’s General Administration of Customs.

Apple has accelerated a shift of production to India, though Trump recently criticized that practice and urged Apple to bring iPhone manufacturing home. The device has never been produced in the US, a project that appears unfeasible at least in the short run.",484,19,callsonreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kr1v8c/smartphone_exports_from_china_to_us_plunge_72_in/,1kr1v8c

2025-05-16 12:15:53,r/AAPL,Optimistic about AAPL's future performance,"The market’s got some good momentum right now. And yeah, I’ll admit it, Apple’s recent years innovation kinda feels like squeezing the last bit of toothpaste outta the tube. Every new release looks more like a tweak than a breakthrough. But here’s the thing: their ecosystem is just too damn strong. You can complain all you want about the interface barely changing, but once you’re locked into the Apple “walled garden,” it’s almost impossible to leave. Everything just works together so seamlessly—the iPhone, Mac, AirPods, Watch—it becomes part of your life. I get frustrated sometimes, sure, but I still keep buying and am bullish on AAPL long-term and think it’ll bring solid returns. I’m also paying attention to trading plays to catch short-term and long-term opportunities.

Lately I’ve been using AI tools like [TigerAI](https://ttm.financial/gpt?_sasdk=fNDEyMjQxNDAyMTA2NDY5Mg&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_content=signup&amp;invite=RDCBA&amp;utm_term=stock_analysis) to help analyze stocks.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-05-12 15:15:04,r/stocks,(05/12) Interesting Stocks Today - Major Reductions in Tariffs!,"This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

I don't know how sustained today's move will be- we've made a massive move upwards, and even 30% tariffs will still reduce business with China by 70% in the medium term (\~6 to 9 month timeframe)

News: [Us And China Agree To Major Reductions In Tariffs For 90 Days](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-12/us-and-china-agree-to-major-reductions-in-tariffs-for-90-days)

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&amp;p=d) **/** [**AMZN (Amazon)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN&amp;p=d)\- Both stocks are up \~6% following announcement of a 90-day suspension of U.S.-China tariffs, reducing U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%. Watching $214/$215 in AAPL and seeing if we can make another move higher. Currently long. Obviously this is a 90-day suspension and not actually a guarantee that things will return back to normal. Everything in consumer disc is moving off this news. Risks I'm seeing from this are potential re-escalation of trade tensions and more supply chain disruptions, and I'm thinking of possibly flipping short if we make a massive move upwards.

[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&amp;p=d) **/** [**JD (JD.com)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JD&amp;p=d)\- Chinese tech stocks like BABA and JD are also major winners of tariffs, with both up roughly 6%, following the 90-day agreement. Watching $135 level (basically just seeing which Chinese stocks are close to breaking highs). Risks are the same as American stocks. Other notable stocks I like on this are BIDU/TCEHY (trades OTC)

[**PFE (Pfizer)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PFE&amp;p=d) **/** [**MRK (Merck)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MRK&amp;p=d) **/** [**JNJ (Johnson &amp; Johnson)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JNJ&amp;p=d)\- Trump announced plans to sign an executive order implementing a ""most-favored-nation"" policy to reduce U.S. prescription drug prices by up to 59%. This policy aims to ""align"" U.S. drug prices with the lower prices paid by other countries. Obviously pretty terrible news for anyone investing in pharmaceutical stocks because it affects major revenue sources for this company. The US has limited direct negotiating and mainly relies on private pharmacy benefit managers to negotiate prices in insurance plans currently, which results in sky-high insurance costs. I'm Interested in MRK, we're already broken lows (even during the tariffs) because MRK is highly dependent on Medicare reimbursement (MRK).

[**BP (BP)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BP&amp;p=d)\- BP up on reports that several major oil companies, including Shell, Chevron, and ExxonMobil, are evaluating potential takeover bids. BP is considered undervalued, with a market cap of £57B against asset valuations of \~£120B. No levels I'm watching at this time.

2025-05-09 20:16:32,r/AAPL,How good can this get?,"I have seen multiple doom posts on this sub in the past week, so I thought I would share a bull case for the end of 2026-2027. 

FY 2021 was a huge growth year. Hardware grew 35% YoY and Services grew 28% YoY. Covid stimulus,  low rates, weak USD, and 5G can be attributed to this upgrade cycle. Keep in mind that higher growth rate in hardware translates to more growth in services due to apple care, more users using services, etc.

**The end of 2026-2027 could see another huge growth year due to following factors:**

\-Big Beautiful Bill passes ($200-1000/month savings for social security recipients, overtime workers, and tipped workers. That is essentially stimulus)

\-Lower fed funds rate=mortgage rates at 4.5-5%. This frees up the housing market which lets sellers tap into built up equity and the 20%+ of existing mortgages with 7%+ rates save $400-500/mo - Essentially stimulus

\-Euro to USD goes back to $1.25 from $1.00-1.07 past 3 year range, Yen, RMB, other currencies also strengthen. That is 15-20% gains in revenue with 100% margin excluding income tax. 

\-Apple integrates in-house modems and wifi chips into all devices saving 3-4% in hardware gross margins

\-The Google search case is resolved and the remedy is Google and Apple can't enter into exclusive search deals or they have to re-up the deal each year, but bottom line they can still enter deals- which means Apple keeps that services money and that overhang that has been in the back of investors mind is gone.

\-Epic case is insignificant to App store revenue and Apple either maintains status quo or switches to EU fee model with the core technology fee.

\-Foldable phones, dynamic island cut out is removed,  smart home devices, and Meta type AR glasses are released.

\-tariffs get situated at 10% on US hardware imports which will mostly come from India, Vietnam, etc. 

\-Large upgrade base from end of 2020-early 2022 is at 5 year mark of hardware and needs to upgrade
-Tariffs give Apple excuse to raise phone prices by $100 in US which makes up for 10-15% US tariffs. 

  
**How this translates to earnings:**

Lets say FY 2025 ends at $410 billion revenue and FY 2026 ends at $440 billion in revenue. 

Now lets assume the factors I mentioned played out and hardware revenue grows in FY 2027 24% YoY and services revenue grows 18% YoY. Hardware margins we will assume at 43% due to in-house chips and leverage of more device sales. Services revenue we will put at 77% due to leverage up from 675.7% this past quarter. 

  
FY 2027 hardware revenue: $393 billion up from $317 YoY

FY 2027 Service revenue: $147 billion up from $125 billion YoY

total revenue: $540 billion

gross margin: $282 billion - 52% overall

OPEX: $67 billion

Income before tax: $215 billion

Tax rate: 14.5% due to Big beautiful bill lower rates and credits

Net income: $183 billion

Shares outstanding: \~14 billion

EPS: $13.00

PE at 35-40 due to margin expansion, growth, and much of the legal overhang gone: 

Stock Price: $455-520

According to a recent piece I saw via Tiger’s earnings insights, AI features like the new Siri, summarisation, and writing tools will only be available on A17 Pro and M-series chips. Feels like Apple is quietly engineering a forced upgrade cycle, no?

That article also mentioned an interesting stat: nearly 90% of iPhones in use today are older than 15 Pro, which means a huge addressable base for upgrades. If even a fraction converts, it could meaningfully lift ASPs and margins.

  

They just approved a $100B buyback, bumped dividends, and valuation isn’t ridiculous at 27x forward P/E. So the big question:

Is this the start of a new iPhone cycle, or just hype baked into the price already?

* AAPL’s already got thin margins on hardware. Tariffs could force price hikes or eat profits—either way, stock takes a hit, right?
* NVDA’s GPU dominance might not care about EU rules, but if China retaliates with their own tariffs (they’re already rumbling), supply chains could get messy.
* Smaller players like AMD or QCOM might feel the pain faster than the big dogs. Anyone holding these?

I’m not seeing much buzz about this on X or here, but markets don’t always price in risks like this right away. Are we all too busy chasing AI pumps or TSLA’s next tweet to care? Or is this just noise that’ll blow over?Curious what you all think. I’m holding some AAPL and NVDA but wondering if I should trim or grab puts for a hedge.

2025-05-05 20:51:02,r/AAPL,Alternate Payments Impact- Epic Games Case Discussion,"I imagine if the effect of the Epic games case was significant, Apple would roll out the terms similar to the EU that it had to implement. This would allow for alternate payments, but Apple would charge the Core technology fee and lower its commission. Overall, for big players like Epic, Spotify, etc the alternate option is much more expensive based on the calculator than the pre-existing terms currently in place.  I think for smaller developers the new EU fee structure seems slightly beneficial, but for larger developers the original Apple fee structure seems much cheaper. Let me know if you have more insight into this topic.

[https://developer.apple.com/support/fee-calculator-for-apps-in-the-eu](https://developer.apple.com/support/fee-calculator-for-apps-in-the-eu)

Example:

this would be an app with $100 m in revenue/year and 60m downloads per year. The pre-existing cost is only 2.3 m euros/month.

Edit: I found this article on EU apps for the new fee structure. The EU only makes up about 7% of App store revenue, but this article shows that $400k monthly revenue apps come out worse with the new terms. I imagine the US has a large share of higher MRR apps.

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary. 

News: [Trump Suggests Some Trade Deals Could Come As Early As This Week](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-05/trump-suggests-some-trade-deals-could-come-as-early-as-this-week)

[**PLTR (Palantir)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&amp;p=d)\- We broke all-time highs today after a \~10 point move on Friday, driven largely by Trump's new defense spending proposal. Earnings are today and will likely make or break the move; I was mainly interested in a short opportunity but with the defense spending proposal my plans are toast. Likely will trade earnings. $125 is the ATH and we broke that this morning, interested to see if we can hold that at the open. Short biased, but PLTR has had such a steady-strong move that I'm very handsoff unless we do something crazy like jump to $130 during regular trading hours. 

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&amp;p=d)\- Reported somewhat disappointing earnings on Thursday mainly due to uncertainty from tariffs, interested to see if it can continue momentum to the downside. Interested primarily in the $200 level, we've been selling off for the past 4 days and have had a slow decline due to earnings. AAPL is the most heavily affected company from tariffs, and the longer they go on the worse  it gets for consumer companies. Currently long but will bail if we break $200 today. 

[**NFLX (Netflix)/DIS (Disney)/CMCSA (Comcast)/WBD (Warner Bros.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NFLX&amp;p=d)\- Trump orders 100% tariff on foreign-made movies, escalating trade tensions and potentially disrupting global media revenue streams. This is a material policy shift that could affect distribution costs and reshape content strategies. Primarily interested in NFLX despite the high price of the stock, they moved the most (5% at time of writing) and do most of their filming overseas to save on costs. Most streaming services struggle with the costs of movies exploding over the years, this cuts into profitability as well. Retaliatory tariffs from other countries and disrupted international partnerships pose downside risks. A prolonged policy could lead to margin compression across the sector.

[**NNI (Navient)/MMS (Maximus)/SOFI (SoFi)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NNI&amp;p=d)\- Student loan collections begin today since the pause happened during COVID. This could drive momentum in loan servicers. Oddly enough, I haven't seen much movement in loan collections stocks- but I do expect them to move when the surges of loans come in. There's still macro overhang that could affect these companies in the longer term (months) if we do go into an economic recession. Mainly watching for any news of loan pauses (which I think are unlikely).

2025-05-04 03:14:23,r/AAPL,APPL analysis for 2025,"Apple's recent 4% dividend increase signals a strong commitment to shareholder value, likely attracting renewed interest from long-term investors. The company's $100 billion stock buyback program, set to commence in 2025, should further bolster investor confidence, enhance share price stability, and support sustained demand for the stock.
To mitigate risks associated with tariffs and reduce reliance on China-centric production, Apple is strategically pivoting its manufacturing operations to countries like Vietnam and India. This diversification aims to alleviate cost pressures from potential trade disruptions and improve supply chain resilience. However, Apple's heavy dependence on China for logistics and production remains a vulnerability, exposing the company to geopolitical and economic risks beyond its control.
A significant external factor is the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. While a potential interest rate cut could stimulate economic growth and benefit equities, an unexpected negative catalyst—such as persistent or rising inflation—could trigger market volatility and exert downward pressure on Apple's stock price. Additionally, escalating tariffs on Chinese imports pose a substantial risk, given Apple's reliance on China for its supply chain logistics.
In summary, while Apple's dividend hike, buyback program, and manufacturing diversification strengthen its long-term outlook, uncertainties surrounding Federal Reserve actions and China-related tariff risks warrant cautious optimism.

2025-05-02 17:25:04,r/AAPL,Apple Earnings Ananlysis,"Positives:

* Services Gross Margins: 75.7% - A record
* Services growth 11.6% y/y, good , but a little less than hoped for, but partially due to FX headwinds y/y
* Japan keeps growing 15%+ y/y
* Americas up 8% y/y as Americas has been lower single digit growth in recent Quarters
* iPad and Mac continue strong growth
* Cook stated that able to import most US supply from India and Vietnam in next quarter
* Cook indicated only $900 million tariff hit, so about 1% of revenue, 2% of earnings, and $0.05 of EPS
* China still negative growth, but flat y/y on constant currency basis. Acceleration from prior Quarter

Negatives:

* iPhones only up 2% y/y - Partly due to FX headwinds
* Wearables was down 5%, and was the main cause for my EPS estimate of $1.70-1.71 to miss
* Hardware gross margin down y/y to 35.9% from 36.6%- partly due to FX y/y impact
* Europe growth only 1% which was disappointing due to them having low double digit growth in the past few quarters. FX had an impact on that as well
* Uncertainty past June quarter for tariff impact - specifically Section 232 tariffs
* Epic Lawsuit - App Store payments
* Siri AI delays

  
\-Overall, I think this was a good quarter, and guidance was much better than feared weeks ago. The stock reaction is mostly attributed to the uncertainty past the June quarter due to section 232 tariff concerns along with other uncertainty. I think this is overblown. Apple has shown it can navigate its supply chain overnight and I do not imagine the Section 232 tariffs will be any more than the 20% fentanyl tariffs they are currently facing from China.

\-The Epic lawsuit I think is overblown, I do not see the earnings impact being more than 1-2%

\-Apple does need to get Siri figured out to further boost sales growth in my opinion. 

My future thoughts:

\-I think EU, Japan, and Asia Pacific could have good future quarter growth if the USD continues to stay in the current range

\- I think China could rebound as Apple now has the 16E, 16, and 15 able to take advantage of the subsidies. 

\- I think in house modems and wifi chips in the next year or so will help negate tariff impacts and alternate payment losses

Q3 2025 estimates

I think revenue grows 6-7%. Apple guided low to mid single digits. I am hovering slightly higher due to favorable FX. 

This puts revenue at: 91.7 billion

Gross margin: 46.5%

OPEX: 15.4 billion

OIE: -300

Shares outstanding: 14.92 billion

Diluted EPS: $1.53 - 9% growth Y/Y, Would be 13% Y/Y if you add back the $900 million tariff impact

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-05-01 22:33:23,r/stocks,Apple revenue tops Wall Street expectations but Services division disappoints,"Apple reported second fiscal-quarter earnings Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations, but the company’s closely-watched Services division came up light versus estimates.  

Here’s how Apple did versus consensus estimates for the quarter ending in March: 

* EPS $1.65 vs. $1.63 estimated by LSEG 

* Revenue: $95.4 billion vs. $94.66 billion estimated by LSEG 

* iPhone revenue: $46.84 billion vs. $45.84 billion estimated, per StreetAccount 

* Mac revenue: $7.95 billion vs. $7.77 billion estimated, per StreetAccount  

* iPad revenue: $6.4 billion vs. $6.20 billion estimated, per StreetAccount 

* Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue: $7.52 billion vs. $7.95 billion, per StreetAccount 

* Services revenue: $26.65 billion vs. $26.70 billion, per StreetAccount 

* Gross margin: 41.7% vs. 47.1%, per StreetAccount 

The company reported $1.65 per share on $24.78 billion of net income during the quarter, versus $23.64 billion, or $1.53 per share, in the year-ago period. 

Apple typically provides data points about how it sees the current quarter shaping up on a call with analysts. Wall Street is highly anticipating CEO Tim Cook’s first public comments on how Apple will navigate rapidly-shifting tariffs proposed by the Trump administration. 

Analysts are looking for third-quarter guidance of $1.48 in earnings per share on $89.45 billion of sales. 

Cook told CNBC that Apple is already sourcing about half of the iPhones for the U.S. from India, and most of its other products for the U.S. from Vietnam, where tariffs are lower than they are from China. Apple still makes the “vast majority” of its products for other countries from China, Cook said.  

“If you look at the U.S., over half of the U.S. sales of iPhone come from India,” Cook said. “If you look at the other products, Mac and iPad and AirPods and the Watch, almost all of the country of origin is Vietnam.” 

Cook said the iPhone uses a lot of chips made domestically, and that Apple is buying 19 billion chips this year from the U.S.  

“With an iPhone, you really have to go a step lower and look at the individual parts and where they come from,” he said.  

Apple said its board authorized up to $100 billion in share repurchases this quarter, down from $110 billion in authorization last year. Apple also said it would pay a dividend of 26 cents per share, a 4% increase. 

“We continue to plan for annual dividend increases,” Cook said.  

The company’s most important product line, iPhones, topped estimates at $46.8 billion in sales during the quarter. The overall product line’s sales were up just under 2% on an annual basis.  

Apple’s profitable Services division includes iCloud subscriptions, services like Apple Music and Apple TV+, warranties and revenue from search licensing deals like its agreement with Google.  

Cook, in a statement, hailed “double-digit” Services growth to $26.65 billion in revenue during the quarter, an annual increase of 11.65%. However, Services revenue came in slightly under StreetAccount expectations, and last year, Apple’s services division grew 14.2% during the March quarter.  

Apple hardware generally did well during the quarter. 

Mac sales rose nearly 7% to just under $8 billion, and iPad sales were up 15% on an annual basis to $6.4 billion. Apple introduced new mid-priced iPad Air and MacBook Air models in March.  

However, Apple’s wearables division, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods and accessories sales, declined 5% versus the same period last year to $7.52 billion in revenue. 

Sales in Greater China, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, were down slightly year-over-year at $16 billion. Cook said that China sales were accelerating on a quarterly basis, and that Apple sales in the region would have been flat if not for foreign exchange rates.  

On the other hand, sales in the Americas, Apple’s largest market that has seen some increased consumer demand ahead of tariffs, rose nearly 8%. Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that Apple had not seen evidence of order “pull forward” because of tariffs.  

“We don’t believe that there was a significant pull forward due to tariffs into the March quarter,” Cook said. “There’s no obvious evidence of it.”

2025-04-29 00:40:33,r/stocks,Stock investing tips for newcomers?,"Hey!

So i'm looking for advice on what are some good possible growth stocks i could invest in? I am fairly new in stock investing and my portfolio consists of 95% ETF and Index funds, so i thought i'd like to add some more growth potential into it by dabbling in some stocks. 

Now before anyone tells me, i am aware that stocks pose bigger risks, but i can stomach the added risk. 

I currently only have ~4% of my portfolio invested in a stock that i trust from my homecountry, but i was thinking of adding some good growth stocks and 'safe' well established stocks. I know of some of the big tech ones like AMD, NVDA, AAPL, AMZN, etc but thats about it. 

Any suggestions on what other great stocks there are out there that i could look into and possibly start investing in would be amazing!

2025-04-29 00:32:06,r/stocks,"Stock market today: Dow, S&amp;P 500 erase slide to rise for 5th straight day in lead up to Big Tech earnings","Stocks closed mixed on Monday but recovered from sharp losses to begin a big week of heavyweight earnings reports and macroeconomic data that will continue to paint an early picture of the US economy's response to President Trump's tariffs.

The S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) erased losses of as much as 1% to rise just above the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged up 0.3%, notching its longest win streak of 2025. Both indexes ended in positive territory for the fifth straight day.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell below the flatline, as shares of Big Tech recovered from steep early-session losses.

Wall Street is coming off a rebounding run last week. The gains came as Trump eased pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, and hinted at light at the end of the tunnel for sky-high 145% tariffs on China. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it was ""up to China"" to deescalate the trade battle, though he suggested its recent moves to exempt certain US goods from duties represented a positive step.

Earnings are the highlight of the week ahead, with 180 S&amp;P 500 companies expected to report quarterly financial results. Big Tech leads the way, as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) are all due in the coming days, alongside Coca-Cola (KO), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Chevron (CVX).

Broader economic news will flavor the coming days, as investors eye Wednesday's release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumer Expenditures (PCE) index, to see the impact of tariffs on the general public's ""core"" expenses. An initial reading on first quarter US GDP is also due Wednesday.

The April jobs report is also in sight, as the labor market has so far remained resistant to signs of economic slowdown.

The April jobs report is also in sight, as the labor market has remained resistant to signs of economic slowdown. Economists expect the US economy added 133,000 nonfarm payroll jobs last month, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2%.

The most critical reading may be the non-farm payrolls report on Friday, as the market expects an addition of about 125K jobs.

The goldilocks read may be around 100-150K jobs. We don't want a number that is too strong, as it would likely decrease the probabilities for future rate cuts. At the same time, we don't want a number that is perceived as too weak, as it would imply that the economy may be worsening more rapidly than anticipated, raising recession and other concerns.

My original plan for May was to bulk up on LMT (not a tech company, but adjacent in some ways) because I think that will go back up again at some point.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

&gt;WASHINGTON, April 23 (Reuters) - The White House said on Wednesday that fines on Apple (AAPL.O) and Meta Platforms (META.O) by the European Union were a ""novel form of economic extortion"" that the United States will not tolerate.
&gt;
&gt;**WHY IT'S IMPORTANT**
&gt;
&gt;Apple was fined 500 million euros ($570 million) on Wednesday and Meta 200 million euros, as EU antitrust regulators handed out the first sanctions under landmark legislation aimed at curbing the power of Big Tech.
&gt;
&gt;The fines were seen as a development that could stoke tensions between the EU and U.S. President Donald Trump who has threatened to levy tariffs against countries that penalize American companies.
&gt;
&gt;**CONTEXT**
&gt;
&gt;The White House on Wednesday called the legislation, the Digital Markets Act (DMA), discriminatory.
&gt;
&gt;The fines followed a year-long investigation by the European Commission, the EU executive, into whether the companies comply with the DMA that seeks to allow smaller rivals into markets dominated by the biggest companies.
&gt;
&gt;**KEY QUOTES**
&gt;
&gt;""This novel form of economic extortion will not be tolerated by the United States,"" a White House spokesperson said.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d)\- Reported Q1 earnings with EPS of $0.27 vs. $0.39 expected and revenue of $19.34B vs. $21.11B expected. Total revenue declined 9% year-over-year, with automotive revenue dropping 20% to $14B. Net income fell 71% to $409M, or $0.12 per share. The company attributed the decline to factory retooling for the refreshed Model Y, lower average selling prices, and increased sales incentives. That was a brutal earnings report, yet Trump announcing that he'll be nice to China saved the stock and pushed the entire market up. Interested in $275 and $250 levels.

Whether this will actually hold and be his stance going forward is entirely up to him (he changed his mind a lot during 2019's trade wars). Assuming that the market holds up today, I'm primarily watching my current positions in NVDA/AAPL and ready to flip short if we make some ridiculously unsustainable move or if Trump changes his mind.

[**LLY (Eli Lilly)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LLY&amp;p=d)\-Filed lawsuits against four telehealth companies for selling unauthorized compounded versions of its GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. (LLY's diabetes drug Mounjaro went into short supply in 2022, allowing pharmacies and outsourcing facilities to produce the treatment, a practice called compounding). These drugs generated over $16.4B in revenue last year. Interestingly enough I see this case as pretty major despite not moving the stock significantly today, deciding whether GLP-1 is essentialy ""genericized"" to the point where any company can sell it or only the original developers of the drug. NVO might face the same thing in the future. If LLY loses, that's a huge blow for both of them.

[**HTZ (Hertz)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HTZ&amp;p=d)\-The potential rollback of tariffs by the Trump administration could negatively impact Ackman's thesis that used cars are more valuable due to tariffs. The stock is nearing $9, the previous high when the tariff news was announced. I'm interested in shorting the stock if we make a parabolic move up or if we fail to break $9 (but as always, it's dependent on how we get there). Automotive rental companies have benefited from higher used car values amid tariff-induced supply constraints.

I estimated the mac and iPhone revenue growth based on the IDC, CounterPoint, and Canalys articles I will link below. Services gross margins at 75% was also another big factor for EPS growth. I maintained hardware margins at last year's 36.5% rate. Overall gross margin in my estimate is 47.2% which is within Apple's guidance from the Q1 call. I also linked Q2 2024 earnings for reference. I believe guidance for Q3 could be better than feared due to strong services growth and a weaker US dollar which will help offset the tariff impact to US hardware margins.

Color from Q1 call: The color we're providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we're projecting today for the current quarter. As the dollar strengthens significantly, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind and to have a negative impact on revenue of about 2.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. Despite that headwind, we expect our March quarter total company revenue to grow low to mid single digits year over year. We expect services revenue to grow low double digits year over year.

When you remove the negative impact of the foreign exchange headwinds I described earlier, the year-over-year growth rate would be comparable to that of the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46.5% and 47.5%. We expect operating expenses to be between $15.1 billion and $15.3 billion. We expect OI&amp;E to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%.

2025-04-22 16:01:49,r/AAPL,Is Apple relying on Its old formula or will AI help it make a comeback?,"Defensive Strengths:

Service business margins are impressive: 72%, which is twice the margin of their hardware. iCloud just raised prices by 15%, but user retention is still above 90%.

Active devices worldwide: 2.2 billion. Each device generates an average of $43 in annual service revenue (that’s doubled over the past 5 years).

iPhone 16 features ""Apple Intelligence"": AI-powered photo editing, real-time translation, and a smarter Siri that’s literally smarter now.

Offensive Weaknesses:

Hardware innovation is stagnating: The Vision Pro only sold 200,000 units—way below the 500,000 expected.

Losing ground in China: Market share dropped from 19% to 15%, with Huawei taking back control of the $4000 price segment.

Valuation: Apple’s PE is 33.6x, compared to Google’s 27x and Microsoft’s 30x. They need to prove AI will drive new revenue.

Key Validation Points:

Watch the iPhone 16’s first-week sales in September—if it’s over a 10% increase compared to the iPhone 15, that’s a good sign.

The AI demo at June's WWDC will be a major indicator—can it outperform Google’s Gemini?

Pay attention to the discounts during China’s “618” e-commerce festival—if they drop prices by more than 20%, it could signal inventory pressure.

Action Plan:

For Long-Term Investors: Hold but consider shifting your portfolio. Reduce exposure to hardware chains like Luxshare and Lens Technology, and increase exposure to service-based sectors like Apple Music and Apple Pay.

For Short-Term Traders: Consider an event-driven strategy. Buy Call options (strike price at $220) before WWDC, then cash out after the earnings report. And hey, if you’re looking to manage risk more effectively, moomoo’s platform could be a smooth way to execute your strategy, or even try tiger for added flexibility in your trades.

2025-04-22 13:26:34,r/AAPL,How I've been making 10–15% monthly for the past 3 years trading stocks using just one Indicator,"This method is pretty straightforward and comes down to following the rules exactly, using just one indicator: the Stochastic Oscillator.

First, open up the indicator tab and add the Stochastic Oscillator. Set it to 5 - 3 - 3 (close/close) and use the 15-minute timeframe.

For my trading software setup, I use free TradingView Premium from [r/BestTrades](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestTrades/comments/1jzzh6s/tradingview_premium_free_lifetime_2025_edition/). It’s an absolute must-have if you're doing serious analysis. They have versions for both Windows and Mac. Having access to more indicators and real-time price data has made a huge difference, and the fact that it’s free is just a bonus. **If you want to use paid version - do it. I am simply sharing what worked for me!**

You’ll see three zones on the oscillator:

0 to 20 is the oversold zone, meaning the stock is considered too cheap and often signals a good time to buy.  
80 to 100 is the overbought zone, which usually signals a good spot to sell or look for a short.  
Anything between 20 and 80 is the neutral zone, and for this strategy we completely ignore it.

Now here’s how I enter trades:

Both stochastic lines need to fully enter and then exit one of the extreme zones, either overbought or oversold.  
Use the crosshair to mark where the red signal line crosses out of the zone.  
Wait for two candles in a row that are the same color, green for buys and red for sells.  
The wicks on those two candles should be smaller than their bodies. This shows clean price action with momentum.  
If everything lines up, I enter the trade at the open of the third candle using shares of the stock.

For exits, I usually target a 1.5 to 2.5 percent return depending on volatility and how strong the move looks. If momentum stays solid, I might hold a bit longer, but most trades are done within 30 to 60 minutes.

This works best on large-cap stocks and ETFs with good volume like AAPL, AMD, TSLA, SPY, or QQQ. I’ve used this strategy to consistently make 10 to 15 percent a month on my capital. No tricks or fancy signals, just a simple method, tested over time, and sticking to the rules.

If you’re curious or not sure, try it out on paper first. That’s how I started before trading live.

2025-04-19 08:17:49,r/stocks,This market is really not behaving well. Where do we most likely go from here?,"I think traders and close market analysts realize this more than many people do. From a technical standpoint of course, but a fundamental one.
Fundamental I mean - The concerns that the market was overvalued in the first place... And that trump was going to drop a bomb on the market and dollar itself in some way, shape or form. The foregone conclusion by MSM when the bearish market began in early March that it was just tariffs and trump, or ""still a bull market"" as portrayed by cnbc and then by more MSM once we dropped more than 5 percent. The fact more people than now rely more on retirement appreciation - many times a sign of or near a market top. The talk of depression, parallels to Hoover, Smoot - Hawley, etc. I seriously doubt I honestly was the only one who had my strongest worries since when covid was emerging (but this time feels worse...)

Some concerning features to me are the number of new investors /traders who keep thinking 2020 and 2022 bottoms were like this and now more than ever I'm hearing (accurately ) big drops feel scary, and they always recover. They don't have to always, it's just that they recently have. 

So yeah, I guess that's the question. I don't have a crystal ball of where we are going, but where is it most likely to go? The price action last week was fairly flat-for this market. (down 8 pts on SPY) , but felt genuinely mostly worse than that. Worse case-I fear there will be an added crisis fueled by Trump in the near term or something else internal/ external but important - causing a severe down leg once again. Perhaps that could be poor earnings next week with added economic concerns, Trump firing powell and wrecking the dollar and markets more, or more countries forming ""anti USA"" trade alliances. Best case? Do we move flat in a kangaroo market? Is there significant upside potential if strong earnings come in? I've asked myself the last question a lot, and normally I'd say yes, but now I doubt that, or that the risk/reward will be skewed severely to the downside.

This is kind of the first generalized thing I've felt I could say with any degree of confidence in a while. I could look like a stupid fool a year from now, but maybe not. 

Here's what I've done that's not in any way trading related.  I'm adding to foreign businesses and bonds. For a larger non trading account that can't take heavy risk, that's not my own per se we bought German bonds and more Nokia stock. The bonds are up 5 percent due to the euro, and Nokia is flat. I like Nokia's business as they are not exposed to the tariff nonsense and have big contracts to provide 4g in developing countries still on older networks. This is huge business for them. I'm keeping the Berkshire position, I added to it last year, although I'm a bit surprised by its resilience so far, though I also kept Google (it's doing much worse than I would've expected) but sold two other tech stocks, aapl and Msft. Sold apple when I realized how much Berkshire itself had dumped of apple. Sold Msft because comparably it seemed more expensive and vulnerable in this downturn I thought was likely.



There's a school of thought that says ""markets aren't supposed to make us always feel comfortable"" and that this is why long term holders, ten or more years, will ""always"" or almost always be rewarded as a result. That's generally, but not always been accurate for the past 50 years.
Another consideration:what do you personally feel most of the public feels who have moderate stock exposure? I'm talking like portfolios of $50,000-$500,000. Some of these people may not pay attention to the markets much, but would be overly concerned of a significant market drop. They may just own etfs, or general retail investors. I personally feel many of these people are not overly concerned right now.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Hey everyone,

After years of bouncing between trends, missing some massive moves (energy in 2022, early AI), and learning from crashes like 2020 and 2022, I’ve built what I hope is a **macro-resilient, globally balanced, thematic long-term portfolio**.

It’s designed to:

* Withstand **2020-style collapses**
* Endure **2022 inflation + rate shocks**
* Thrive in **AI, robotics, green energy, space, and aging population megacycles**
* Hold through decades — **not just years**

Would love your takes, critiques, and improvements.

* Doesn’t panic-sell when things get ugly
* Still captures long-term megatrends
* Feels like a **real system**, not a Reddit FOMO portfolio

# Looking for Feedback On:

* Am I *too* diversified?
* Should I consolidate some ETFs or lean harder into fewer themes?
* Am I missing any critical macro theme? (nuclear? private credit? Agri?)
* Would you trust this structure to grow for 30+ years with minimal maintenance?

Looking forward to your feedback on this.

[Gold](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/investing/article/gold-price-today-wednesday-april-16-2025-gold-opens-with-new-high-134956304.html) has surpassed the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks as the most crowded trade on Wall Street as the precious metal surged to record highs this year amid volatile markets and an uncertain economic backdrop.

According to the latest Bank of America fund managers survey published this week, nearly half of the fund managers surveyed (49%) see long gold, or bets that gold prices will rise, as the most crowded trade in the market right now. This marks the first time in two years that fund managers did not see the Magnificent Seven as Wall Street's most crowded trade, according to the survey.

Gold futures ([GC=F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GC=F/)) on Wednesday rose to an all-time high of $3,334 as investors continued to [favor the safe-haven asset](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-notches-best-week-since-2020-amid-shaken-investor-confidence-in-us-201546983.html) amid a falling US dollar ([DX-Y.NYB](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!HIhgXKgPRojUSTTqYlaKSTMqCnabU-_BFJYcQNg1l9bJcllZ1Gp3LtN-1O0pcbknpYvKz0DBczt7-zHHf99GDzXJ1VfxDc7wuw$)) and tariff uncertainty.

Gold prices have surged more than 27% year to date, while the Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL), [GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)), and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) — are down considerably.

Tesla stock has led Magnificent Seven losses and is down about 38% since the start of 2025. Apple stock has fallen 21%.

Nvidia stock has also declined 21% year to date. On Wednesday,[ the AI chip giant warned of a multibillion-dollar ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-dives-as-chipmaker-sees-55-billion-hit-from-surprise-china-chip-controls-130319576.html)impact from US export controls on China, which weighed on shares.

Shares of Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon — the remainder of the Magnificent Seven — are all down by double-digit percentages since the start of the year.

Gold's rally comes as [central banks' demand hit all-time highs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-demand-hits-record-levels-as-central-banks-buy-at-eye-watering-pace-205945413.html) last year and as investors increased inflows into physical gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

""The new highs in gold are signaling a shift in appetite for US assets,"" Ryan McIntyre, senior managing partner at asset manager firm Sprott, recently told Yahoo Finance.

""Confidence in the US has clearly been shaken, so people are looking to diversify.""

Wall Street analysts have remained bullish on gold, [upping their price forecasts ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-keeps-upping-its-bullish-calls-on-gold--heres-why-162732492.html)on the precious metal even amid its fast ascent.

Some 42% of fund managers expect gold will be the best-performing asset of 2025, up from 23% in March, according to Bank of America.

The firm's survey also showed investors have rotated out of US assets by a record amount over the past two months, with 73% of respondents saying ""US exceptionalism"" has peaked.",460,9,callsonreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1k0nih7/after_surge_to_record_highs_gold_overtakes/,1k0nih7

* Netflix shares jumped Tuesday after a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.
* The streaming giant aims to double its revenue by 2030 and reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday.
* Netflix is set to report first-quarter results after the market closes Thursday.

Netflix (NLFX) shares jumped Tuesday following a report company executives laid out ambitious targets at a business review meeting last month.

Executives said the streaming giant aims to double the $39 billion in revenue Netflix brought in last year, with a global ad sales target of $9 billion by 2030, *The* *Wall Street Journal* reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The streaming giant also aims to reach a [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) of $1 trillion by 2030, the report said, up from roughly $419.2 billion. The only U.S. companies with a market cap above $1 trillion today include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B).

Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shares were up more than 5% in recent trading Tuesday, leading gains on the S&amp;P 500. They've added about 60% of their value over the past 12 months. (Read *Investopedia's* live coverage of [today's market action here](https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-04152025-11715325).)

Last week, Morgan Stanley analysts named Netflix a [“top pick,”](https://www.investopedia.com/netflix-a-top-pick-for-morgan-stanley-on-expected-resilience-to-a-weaker-market-11712037) arguing the company could be well-positioned to withstand the current tariff landscape. The streaming giant has shown ""momentum” in its core subscription business, the analysts said. That momentum lowers the company’s overall risk, the bank added, even if the advertising market struggles amid rising trade tensions.

This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

Back to the regularly scheduled programming.

News: [China Tells Airlines Stop Taking Boeing Jets As Trump Tariffs Expand Trade War](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-15/china-tells-airlines-stop-taking-boeing-jets-as-trump-tariffs-expand-trade-war)

[**MP (MP Materials)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MP&amp;p=d)\- Trump is preparing an executive order to establish a U.S. strategic reserve of critical rare earth minerals and metals, aiming to reduce U.S. dependence on China, which has recently halted exports of seven rare earth elements to the U.S. in response to trade tensions. Interested in MP's $30 level. Rare earth metals are important because they're used in technology, electronics, defense, and literally everything with a computer, with China controlling over 80% of all REMs. It is noteworthy that China entirely refines these metals and produces 90% of the global supply of these magnets. We're back in BLOPS2 baby! 

[**BA (Boeing)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BA&amp;p=d)\-China has ordered its airlines to suspend deliveries of Boeing jets and halt purchases of aircraft-related equipment and parts from U.S. companies, a direct response to the U.S. imposing tariffs as high as 145% on Chinese goods. Interested in the $150 level. China is a significant market for BA, accounting for a substantial portion (20%!) of its projected deliveries over the next two decades. Despite being far smaller in comparison to Airbus, BA's planes are reserved years in advance, making it difficult for China to avoid using U.S. planes.

[**BULL (Webull Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BULL&amp;p=d)\-Webull Corporation completed a reverse merger with SK Growth Opportunities Corporation and is finally listed after delaying their IPO for years. Overall not interested in this unless we break yesterday's highs, as the price 8x'ing seems ludicrous for a company that should be priced relatively easily (because we have comparables such as HOOD/other brokerages). I'm biased negatively on this stock today.

[**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)\-Nvidia has announced plans to invest up to $500B in building AI supercomputers entirely in the United States. This initiative includes establishing over a million square feet of manufacturing space in Texas, partnering with companies like Foxconn and Wistron. This seems like a play to avoid getting semis tariffed, although the outcome is uncertain, especially with Trump announcing upcoming tariffs in a month or two. Overall see a lot more uncertainty in this stock and AAPL, so extremely important to be aware of the tariff narrative.

His administration on Friday excluded phones, chipmaking equipment and certain computers from steep “reciprocal tariffs in what was seen as a significant boost for technology groups, whose stocks plunged after Trump unleashed a global trade war on “liberation day”.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1. The market was well on its way to entering bear country, and a lot of short positions are sure to follow, particularly with firms that stand to lose the most with tariffs, such as AAPL.
2. Trump posts that ""now is a great time to buy,"" prompting retail investors to flood the markets with purchase orders in advance of an expected announcement, driving up prices and making those with short positions nervous.
3. The announcement actually happens, prompting even more retail investors to buy any large cap stock that sounds reliable (despite having done no prior analysis or thinking).  This drives up prices even higher.
4. Short sellers begin exiting their positions and buying more, driving up prices on everything, including those that would be expected to continue losing amid the China tariffs, such as AAPL.
5. Boom, near-record ""gains"" market-wide, even on stocks that should still be losing, confusing everyone.
6. The next day, those who took long positions exit to capitalize on their gains, resulting in a return to fair market value.

This was a disaster for a lot of people.  Short sellers lost their collective asses yesterday.  It was still a massive loss for investors overall.

My opinion (not financial advice): I'd be selling any position I didn't enter for the long term and exiting this market until calmer seas prevail.  This president has no idea what effects his words have on markets, and is causing havoc that he's not even aware of.  He *thinks* yesterday was a huge win, but in actuality it was a bloodbath for a lot of people.

# Tariff Impact Analysis

To assess the impact of U.S. tariffs on the iPhone 15 Pro, we need to consider the tariff rates applied to imports from each country:​

* **China**: 104%​
* **Taiwan**: 32%​[GSMArena](https://www.gsmarena.com/nikkei_iphone_15_pro_max_component_costs_are_up_by_12_compared_to_14_pro_max-news-60324.php?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **South Korea**: 25%​[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/022316/economics-iphone-aapl.asp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Japan**: 24%​[Reddit+3Reddit+3iFixit+3](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/16pxluj/iphone_15_pro_max_teardown_by_jerryrigeverything/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Other Countries**: Varies​

Assuming the **country of manufacture** for each component as listed above, we can estimate the **tariff cost per component**:​

|**Component**|**Estimated Cost (USD)**|**Country of Manufacture**|**Tariff Rate**|**Estimated Tariff Cost (USD)**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**A17 Pro Chip**|$130|Taiwan|32%|$41.60|
|**Display**|$115|South Korea|25%|$28.75|
|**Cameras**|$73|Japan|24%|$17.52|
|**Titanium Frame**|$50|Various Countries|Varies|Varies|
|**Battery**|$15|China|104%|$15.60|
|**Other Components**|$140|Various Countries|Varies|Varies|

*Note: The* ***Titanium Frame*** *and* ***Other Components*** *are sourced from multiple countries, making it challenging to assign a specific tariff rate without detailed sourcing information.*

# Total Estimated Tariff Impact

Summing the estimated tariff costs for the specified components:​[MacRumors Forums+9AppleInsider+9TechInsights+9](https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/10/16/iphone-15-pro-max-costs-12-more-to-make-than-iphone-14-counterpart?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **A17 Pro Chip**: $41.60​
* **Display**: $28.75​
* **Cameras**: $17.52​
* **Battery**: $15.60​

**Subtotal**: $103.47​[Tom's Guide](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/iphone-15-pro-max-heres-how-much-it-really-costs-apple-to-make?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Without precise data on the **Titanium Frame** and **Other Components**, it's challenging to calculate the exact total tariff impact. However, based on the available data, the **minimum estimated tariff cost** per iPhone 15 Pro (128GB) is approximately **$103.47**.

# Low-End Estimate: ~$85

Assumes Apple has:

* **Diversified most production away from China**
* Sources many components from **tariff-free or low-tariff countries**
* Limits exposure to parts made in China (especially for low-cost items like connectors and batteries)

|**Major Component**|**Tariff Rate**|**Assumed Exposure**|**Estimated Tariff**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|A17 Chip (Taiwan)|32%|100%|$130 × 0.32 = $41.60|
|Display (S. Korea)|25%|100%|$115 × 0.25 = $28.75|
|Camera (Japan)|24%|100%|$73 × 0.24 = $17.52|
|Battery (China)|104%|50% exposure|$15 × 0.5 × 1.04 = $7.80|
|Other Components|Mixed / low|Mostly non-China|Minimal|

✅ **Total Low Estimate: ≈ $85.67**

# High-End Estimate: ~$160

Assumes:

* **High reliance on Chinese suppliers**, especially for battery, connectors, sensors, PCB, and final assembly.
* **Less successful diversification**

|**Component**|**Tariff Rate**|**Assumed Exposure**|**Estimated Tariff**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|A17 Chip (Taiwan)|32%|100%|$41.60|
|Display (Mixed)|Weighted (S.Korea + China)|70% S.Korea, 30% China|$115 × \[(0.7×0.25)+(0.3×1.04)\] = $39.52|
|Camera (Japan)|24%|100%|$17.52|
|Battery (China)|104%|100%|$15.60|
|Other Components|China-heavy|60% China avg.|$190 × 0.6 × 1.04 = $118.56|

🔺 **Total High Estimate: ≈ $160–$175**

2025-04-09 17:54:41,r/AAPL,The Real Impact of Tariffs on Apple Earnings Could be Less than Feared,"Apple did $167 billion in sales in the US last year. I imagine $55 billion of that was services and the other $110 billion was hardware. Apple probably ships around 60-70 million iPhone into the US per year. If India ramps up to 25% of the production, then all Indian smartphones could be shipped to the US and also sold in India and all China ones shipped to Europe, Japan, China, etc. I imagine this would leave a small shipment of iPhones subject to the excessive tariffs. I believe India will make a deal soon and not have a tariff along with Vietnam, Japan. Services should be unimpacted in the US. Lets say the US hardware margins move from 39% to 31% and the margins stay the same in other countries. Lets also assume FX strength in other countries offsets some of the revenue impacts in China from a weaker Yen. Also weaker Yen and lower commodity prices slightly help their margins:

US Hardware: $110 billion at 31% margin

Foreign hardware $181 billion at 40.5% margin

Global services revenue of $110 billion at 75% margin

Stronger Euro, Yen, Rupee adds $8 billion

Weak Yen and less consumer demand  subtracts $8 billion

Earnings:

Gross margin: $190 billion

opex: $60 billion

Op income: 130 billion

Income tax rate: 15.8%

Net income: 109.46

Total shares: 14.8 billion

EPS: $7.40

This would be a great outcome for FY 2025 in tough macro times like this. Apple should have enough inventory for 1-2 quarters in the US. 

Issues:

\-The consumer could weaken globally which makes the situation worse. 

\-Services growth slows to single digits

\-India not able to ramp up enough

\-Other countries do not get tariff relief

\-Donald Trump, Ron Vara, Howard Lutnick

  
To summarize, there are many apparent issues with the tariff news, but if the tariff effect is most limited to US hardware, the effect should not be as bad as what is described by analysts especially knowing Tim Cook is a supply chain expert.

(Again)","This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

China has retaliated.

News: [US Stock Futures Rise As Dip Buyers Emerge After Selloff](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-08/us-stock-futures-rise-as-dip-buyers-emerge-after-selloff)

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&amp;p=d)\-China retaliates with an 84% tariff on US goods. The tariff escalation adds further pressure- Apple has flown literal planeloads of iPhones out of China but that's obviously a stop-gap measure. We've seen AAPL fall to $169, massively beyond what I could have even hoped. Still flat this but probably the #1 play if expecting a tariff reversal- the White House and Trump have signaled that tariffs are here to stay. Currently long a little from $170, but will bail if we hit those prices premarket/at the open.  

**Related Tickers:** AVGO, QCOM, SWKS (all iPhone part manufacturers)

[**WMT (Walmart)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WMT&amp;p=d), [**TGT (Target)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TGT&amp;p=d)\-WMT scraps quarterly operating income forecast, citing Trump’s tariffs. They did cite net sales growing 3-4% this year. WMT backing away from guidance signals the ""we are in danger"" alarm over tariff impact on import costs and consumer demand even with net sales growing. TGT, with similar exposure, is likely to experience margin pressure in coming quarters. Margins are squeezed massively (and retailers are likely to take a loss on some goods simply because it's untenable to continue selling for a loss). 

[**DAL (Delta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DAL&amp;p=d)\- CEO states Trump tariffs are hurting bookings, and was unable to reaffirm guidance. Forecasted Q2 EPS of $1.70–$2.30 vs. $2.23 est. Revenue to range -2% - +2% YoY vs. +1.9% est. Tariff fears hitting forward travel demand are a red flag, especially international bookings. Airlines face multiple macro pressures—tariffs, softening travel sentiment, currency exchange fluctuations, etc, overall a different set of circumstances from COVID yet as deadly. 

[**TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TLT&amp;p=d)\-Massive afterhours move as China sells U.S. Treasuries, resulting in a 5 point move afterhours. Bloomberg is also citing an unwind of popular hedge fund trade. The scale and consistency of the move suggest a structural shift, not just positioning. Treasury market dislocation is raising systemic risk signals across asset classes. I think we've hit roughly \~5% for the 20 year which is a big deal- China dumping treasuries means that yields go up but exacerbate inflation in the short term, and add to volatility.

[**HUM (Humana)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HUM&amp;p=d), [**CVS (CVS Health)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CVS&amp;p=d), [**UNH (UnitedHealth Group)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&amp;p=d)\-Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced higher-than-expected Medicare Advantage payment rate increases for 2026. The unexpected increase in reimbursement rates is a huge tailwind for these providers, improving profit outlooks into 2026. We saw a spike in these health insurance names and subsequent selloff, interested in seeing if we make any sort of upward move today. (Addendum: Trump announced that pharma tariffs are also incoming, which may be the reason why we saw so many of these pull back).

On Friday, CBP issued guidance stating that goods loaded on a vessel and in transit to the United States before 12:01 AM EDT on April 5, 2025 are exempt from additional duties, as long as they are:



* Entered for consumption, or
* Withdrawn from a bonded warehouse for consumption on or after 12:01 PM EDT on April 5, 2025.



To prevent abuse of this exemption, CBP has stated that covered goods must be entered or withdrawn for consumption by 12:01 AM EDT on May 27, 2025. CBP has included a note indicating flexibility in certain cases. The guidance states that “when it is no longer realistic due to the passage of time,” the exemption may still apply beyond May 27—if the importer can provide credible evidence that the delay was outside of their control. Examples might include vessel delays due to weather or port congestion, rerouting or unexpected customs issues, or documentation showing the vessel was already en route to the U.S. before April 5. Below is a copy of the CSMS message for reference:

# CSMS # 64649265 - GUIDANCE – Reciprocal Tariffs, April 5, 2025 Effective Date

The purpose of this message is to provide guidance on the additional duties due on imported merchandise which were imposed by Executive Order, [“Regulating Imports with a Reciprocal Tariff to Rectify Trade Practices that Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits,”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/regulating-imports-with-a-reciprocal-tariff-to-rectify-trade-practices-that-contribute-to-large-and-persistent-annual-united-states-goods-trade-deficits/) issued on April 2, 2025. This guidance applies to the actions that are effective on April 5, 2025.  CBP will issue separate guidance for the actions that are effective on April 9, 2025.

\*\*\*\*\*\*

**9903.01.28:** Articles the product of any country that were (1) loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading and in transit on the final mode of transport prior to entry into the United States before 12:01 a.m. EDT on April 5, 2025, AND (2) are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. EDT on April 5, 2025.

*To prevent importers from abusing the exception for goods that were in transit before April 5, 2025 when it is no longer realistic due to the passage of time, CBP will permit heading 9903.01.28 to be declared only for goods that are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. EDT on April 5, 2025, and before 12:01 a.m. EDT on May 27, 2025.*",8,0,[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/1jv58t3/on_the_water_exclusion_april_5th/,1jv58t3

I don't want to regret getting out now even during a crash. I'm in my 50's but hadn't been actively looking to retire yet and have rental properties so daily cash flow isn't necessarily an issue but was looking for this for the future when I do retire.

My primary holding is a few thousand shares of Apple that I bought back when they were almost going out of business back in the 90's, so it's fair to say that it's been a spectacular gain for me. But now it makes up way too much of my portfolio and yes I should have been rebalancing all this time but it never seemed like a good time since it kept growing. I was going to start selling off this year but now it's a dire need. It kills me that I could have sold at a higher peak but that's hindsight.

The rest of my holdings include a decent mix of tech and telecom stocks plus index ETFs and a bunch of mutual funds. I have NVDA from right before the recent split and Amazon and Google from early pandemic time (these are likely negative now). Also a bunch of losers like Citi that I've been saving for capital gains offset but those will be a drop in the bucket if I sell all AAPL. These are all in a taxable account but I also have various index ETFs in IRAs.

So I'm looking for advice on what and how to sell off tomorrow. Should I do all the AAPL shares and all the ETFs and misc stocks? I'm thinking that selling everything in the IRA accounts would make sense since those aren't taxable.

Apple is obvious but how to do it in the bloodbath?

I do know how to submit the sell order on my broker website but should it just be sell all shares at market? Submit the orders now before market opens or wake up and watch to see what's happening and set limits on the sell price?

And I think mutual funds redemption is at end of day, how to go about exiting those? Wait and see what happens during the day and submit a redemption request?

2025-04-07 03:31:34,r/stocks,"A $2,300 Apple iPhone? Trump tariffs could make that happen.","April 3 (Reuters) - Your favorite iPhone could soon become much pricier, thanks to tariffs.

U.S. President Donald Trump imposed a series of sweeping tariffs on countries around the world that could drastically alter the landscape of global trade, and consumer goods like iPhones could be among the hardest hit, analysts said on Thursday, with increases of 30% to 40% if the company were to pass on the cost to consumers.

Most iPhones are still made in China, which was hit with a 54% tariff. If those levies persist, Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab has a tough choice: absorb the extra expense or pass it on to customers.

Shares of the company closed down 9.3% on Thursday, hitting their worst day since March 2020.

Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year; its biggest markets include the United States, China and Europe.

The cheapest iPhone 16 model was launched in the U.S. with a sticker price of $799, but could cost as much as $1,142, per calculations based on projections from analysts at Rosenblatt Securities, who say the cost could rise by 43% - if Apple is able to pass that on to consumers.

A more expensive iPhone 16 Pro Max, with a 6.9-inch display and 1 terabyte of storage, which currently retails at $1599, could cost nearly $2300 if a 43% increase were to pass to consumers.

2025-04-06 21:56:56,r/AAPL,Bulls on Parade! Reminders on Why We Own AAPL,"Below is some reminders during times like these on why we own Apple. This is a look ahead to positive developments for Fiscal Year 2026 and if these tariffs just end up being noise. Some might view this as hopium, but I think these are feasible notes and are largely are just based on the current business and no new real innovation:

1. Expanding Margins:

FY 2020 products gross margin was 31.5% and services gross margin was 66.0% In  FY 2024, Apple’ s overall gross margin was 46.2%. Its products gross margin was 37.2% and its services gross margin was 73.9%. Overall, gross margins grew by 800 basis points and at an annualized rate of 5%. Also, commodity prices have dropped 10% plus under Trump so far. This can help with supplier costs.

2. Weakening US Dollar relative to the Euro, Yen, Rupee, Pound

The United States dollar index (USDXY) was 10-15% higher in 2024 compared to much of 2020 through mid 2022. Apple has cited 5-8% currency headwinds on revenue in 2024 earnings calls compared to 2020 and 2021 quarters. If you apply a 6% impact to Apple’s 2024 revenue, gross margins would have been closer to 49%-50%. Currently, the USD has dropped from 110 highs in January 10 102.89. The Chinese RMB has stayed flat vs the USD which will not help revenue, but can help Apple with supply chain costs and investment costs in China. If the other aforementioned currencies strengthen by 5-7%, that is an extra $10 billion (These countries accounted for $160 billion in rev FY 2024) in revenue that did not cost anything, so is just subject to income tax for earnings.

3. Vertical Integration

Apple keeps creating more in-house chips. The C1 modem was just put into the 16E. If the C1 modem and the in-house wifi chip come to the full lineup by FY 2026, that could save $8-10 billion in margins. Remember product margins have risen from about 31% to 38% since M1 chip was announced in November 2020.

4. Services Growth

In Q1 2025, services revenue grew by 14% YoY. This is a high margin business that is fueled by a lot of reoccurring revenue, so it helps warrant a higher multiple. Services is about 40% of earnings.  Ex. all of Costco's earnings come from the membership and they trade at 56x PE.

5. Buybacks

Apple reduces the float by 2.5%-3% per year. Since buybacks started, the float has reduced from around 26 billion to 15 billion. This is powerful. For instance, FY 2024 EPS would have been about $3.8 instead of $6.8 if the float was still 26 billion shares

6. $100 billion plus in FCF

This is something you can't put a price on. Sure it is nice to have 30% revenue growth and earnings growth, but what if the cash flow is only $2-5 billion. Can you put a price on having that much power with $100 billion FCF when we get in economic downturns or opportunities pop up?

7. 2.4 Billion Active Devices

Apple has 2.4 billion active devices and over a billion subscribers. Apple keeps further locking in these users.

Putting this all together for FY 2026:

Lets say Apple's product revenue only grows 5% from FY 2024 and Services grows around 12-14% each year.

Product revenue: $310 Billion - Gross margin 42% due to C! modem and wifi chips

Services: $125 Billion - Gross margin 76%

Total Gross margin= $225.2 Billion

Lets add $10 billion for foreign currencies strengthening, so $235 Billion Gross margin.

Total Revenue =$445 Billion

OPEX grows from $57 billion to $65 billion

Operating Income=$170 Billion

Lets say Tax cuts go through and Corporate tax rate drops Apple effective tax rate from 16% to 14.6%

Net Income =$145 billion

Total Shares=14.2 billion

EPS=$10.21. That is 50% EPS growth in 2 years. Only 14% revenue growth

Other calalysts include:

\-New devices such as home automation, AR glasses, etc

\-Commodity prices keep coming down under Trump admin which can lower costs with suppliers

\-Apple able to use tariff noise as excuse to slightly raise prices

\-AI

\-Apple upgrade cycle which has happens every 3-4 years and was last in 2021.

The growth is every 3-4 years as you can see from the years I highlighted (2012,2015,2018,2021) versus the prior 3 years which were stagnant. Apple revenue growth is not linear. Not to mention, foreign exchange is a 7-8% revenue headwind in much of 2022-2025 versus 2020-2021. EPS is growing despite this due to shift to services, expanding margins, and stock buybacks. Higher PE warranted due to reoccurring services business which is high margin and growing at a 14% mark.

2025-04-04 15:11:33,r/stocks,Interesting Stocks Today (04/4) - China Strikes Back,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

**China announced a 34% tariff on the US. The US may retaliate. ""Reciprocal"" tariffs can result in a positive feedback loop of the tariff percentage.**

News: [China Imposes 34 Tariffs On All Us Imports As Retaliation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-04/china-imposes-34-tariffs-on-all-us-imports-as-retaliation)

**AVGO, NXPI, LRCX, AMAT- ALL OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE 20%+ OF THEIR SALES COME FROM CHINA)**\- China imposing a 34% tariff on US imports escalates trade tensions and impacts supply chains, all of which have significant exposure to China. Overall, most interested in NVDA at $95/$90 and possibly INTC at $20 if we don't spike off the open. I'm leaning more bearish for today due to the news being announced so early premarket from China, and also from the fear of the US announcing additional tariffs.

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&amp;p=d)\- AAPL broke $200 premarket following the announcement- mainly due to approximately 20% of AAPL revenue comingfrom China. I'm interested mainly if it breaks $190 intraday. AAPL relies heavily on China for manufacturing, with over 90% of its production based there and newly imposed tariffs are expected to increase AAPL’s annual costs by $8.5B. China adding more tariffs affects AAPL as it is clearly the biggest MAG7 loser of the tariffs. Main risks involve increased production costs, potential price hikes for consumers, and a possible decline in sales volume because our damn phones get far more expensive. Additionally, further escalation in trade tensions could lead to more severe supply chain disruptions. 

[**VXX (VIX Short-Term Futures ETN)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&amp;p=d)\- I still don't think we've peaked (as I mentioned yesterday). We've spiked to \~$40 on the VIX ($75 on VXX). I'm interested in seeing how the US will respond to China tariffs before making any significant trades. The risk in the VXX short is based on overnight headlines from China announcing more tariffs (which already happened), and now, waiting for the US to retaliate. Fun.

[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&amp;p=d)**,** [**FXI (China Large-Cap ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&amp;p=d)**,** [**YINN (China Bull 3X Shares)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=YINN&amp;p=d)**,** [**YANG (China Bear 3X Shares)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=YANG&amp;p=d)**,** [**JD (JD.com)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JD&amp;p=d)\- China-related stocks are selling off due to expectations of retaliation from the US. Also currently just a ""watch"", everything hinges on if the US backs off from tariffs or if we escalate. Interested in BABA if it hits $100. If the US announces escalation of tariffs, I'm mainly interested in a YANG buy. This is potentially the largest catalyst since COVID, so one tweet can move the market.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-04-03 21:34:34,r/stocks,How the USA government calculated the % tariffs charged to the USA by each country,"Yesterday many were confused about how did the government came with such numbers, which were too high for some countries (vietnam), cause this numbers made no sense taking into account current tariffs, some were thinking it was weight based taking into account most traded products or if currency change had something to do with it.

But the reality was much simpler:

This is how it was calculated:

\- They just took the total exports and imports with x country and thats it

Example:

\- China: 

U.S. Imports from China: The United States imported goods worth $438.9 billion from China in 2024.

U.S. Exports to China: The United States exported goods worth $143.5 billion to China in 2024.

(439-143.5)/439=67%

\- Vietnam:

(136.6-13)/136.6=90%

\- Japan:

(148.2-80)/148.2=46%

\- India:

(87.4-41.8)/87.4=52%

Now what does that tells you? 

1.- The reciprocal tariffs or the half vs what they calculated is way too high cause it doesn't reflect the real tariffs

2.- the 10% tariffs will likely wont get moved no matter what x country does (argentina etc), all the countries that import more from usa got the 10% tariff.

3.- Whats the goal of giving such high tariffs? 

\- You can speculate and reach a conclusion on your own, my bet is that they want 2 things:

1: they want the x country to lower some tariffs on some USA products

2: they want billions of investments to USA, like how certain companies already are doing, like aapl, honda, softbank, etc. 

With this Info now you can speculate how things will get worse or better, but the key here is the situation with the key countries, Japan, China, EU, Mexico, vietnam, etc. ",163,26,stiveooo,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jqrvom/how_the_usa_government_calculated_the_tariffs/,1jqrvom

Tech stocks plummeted on Thursday, with Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)) leading ""Magnificent Seven"" names lower following President Trump's[ reciprocal tariff announcement](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-every-country-facing-reciprocal-tariffs-announced-by-trump-on-liberation-day-231329935.html) the day prior.

Shares of Apple, on track for their worst day since March 2020, cratered over 8% in afternoon trade as the stock erased $300 billion from its market cap. The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.

On Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India — all set to take effect on April 9.

Notably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important [production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.

""Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[ like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.

As trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.

""The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,"" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate ""this new world of tariffs.""

Until then, he warned, ""tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.""

Other Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.

In afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.

Outside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.

""The implications \[of the announced tariffs\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \[chip\] sector,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. ""These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.""

Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.

He added, ""The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP. [So if this tips us into recession, ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.""",214,4,callsonreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jqpre5/apple_sheds_300_billion_in_tarifffueled_selloff/,1jqpre5

Steve Mnunchin who was treasury secretary during first Trump term just said on CNBC he imagines their will be an exemption credit for Apple due to their $500 B announcement. Why would Tim Cook have given Trump that announcement during the 20% fentanyl China tariffs. Why would Apple lower new MacBook Air by $100 in March with this on horizon? I believe they have to know something.

Catalysts

-USDXY has fallen 7.2% since January 2025 high. I believe this along with lower oil prices can help offset any tariff price hikes. USD weakness could 3%+ in revenue.

-Lower fed funds rates

- Apple C1 modems and WiFi chips can help increase margins in next 1-2 years. I believe these could add $8-10 billion in margins. 

I believe overall Apple will carve out exemptions, but I think USD weakness and switching to in house modems/wifi chips can help offset tariff effects. Also, 40% of the earnings comes from Services which I do not see as being affected much by tariffs. If Apple has $90-100 B in product cost in US, tariffs  would add $25 B in costs, so either producers would have to eat because of Apple negotiating power, Apple could eat in some way as well as offset with carrier trade-ins and reduced trade in value.

2025-04-03 15:12:14,r/stocks,Interesting Stocks Today (04/3) - Liberation Day,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

**Stay agile, and be on the lookout for tariff news from Beijing.**

News: [Trump's Tariff Announcement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-04-02/trump-s-tariff-announcement)

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&amp;p=d)\- 34% tariff on Chinese imports, adding to existing duties, brings the total to 54% effective April 9. AAPL relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing, and these tariffs are expected to lead to increased production costs, which will be passed on to consumers through higher prices. Watching $200, but likely the stock I'm going to play if there's any chance of a bounce (in addition to NVDA). These tariffs will result in retaliatory measures from China, further impacting Apple's supply chain and profitability. Additionally, prolonged tariffs could lower consumer demand due to higher prices. Related Tickers: AVGO, SWKS, TSM, QCOM.

[**CRWV (CoreWeave)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&amp;p=d)\- Google is reportedly in advanced discussions to rent Nvidia's Blackwell AI servers from CoreWeave. This potential partnership is huge because it means that CRWV has a little more diversification in their revenue stream (alleviating a huge risk to the company). It's hard, this has risen so much from the IPO but we're back at pre-tariff and pre-announcement prices- have a small long position but likely will exit due to all the craziness today and need to focus on the bigger fish. Despite Taiwanese chips not being tariffed, CRWV will likely benefit due to the rising costs of chips.

[**RH (Restoration Hardware)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RH&amp;p=d)\- Reported EPS of $1.58 vs $1.92 expected. Revenue of $812M vs $829M. The company issued guidance for the current fiscal year, projecting revenue growth of 10% to 13%, an adjusted operating margin between 14% and 15%, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20% to 21%. Management highlighted concerns over a higher-risk business environment due to tariffs, market volatility, and inflation risks, noting that RH has been operating in the ""worst housing market in almost 50 years."" Interested at $150, but won't focus on this today vs AAPL or other Mag7 names that are selling off.

[**VXX (VIX Short-Term Futures ETN)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&amp;p=d)\- The recent spike in volatility attributed to ""Liberation Day"" saw a massive VIX spike along with everything else selling off. Interested in seeing what we do but I doubt today will be the day I take a short position- volatility is coming and is not as likely to be the quick one-day spikes we've seen in the past. We may see additional tariffs from China in retaliation.

[**NKE (Nike)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&amp;p=d)\- Nike is one of the biggest losers due to tariffs, as a substantial portion of its manufacturing is based in Southeast Asian countries facing high tariff rates. Notably, Nike produces nearly 50% of its footwear and 30% of its apparel in Vietnam. Currently long, but will bail if we break new lows (\~$55.20). Prolonged tariffs lead to higher consumer prices, and NKE has cited lowered demand/guidance for its goods due to competitors.

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)\- NVIDIA's exposure to the recent tariff announcements appears limited, as the 32% levy on imports from Taiwan. The White House clarified that semis are exempt from these tariffs, which provides a buffer for NVIDIA's core business and limits downside risk from the new trade measures. We still saw a 6% move post-tariff announcement.",16,15,WinningWatchlist,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jqi2wj/interesting_stocks_today_043_liberation_day/,1jqi2wj

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-03-25 23:14:10,r/stocks,Stocks Close Higher for 3rd Straight Day; Tesla Surges in Late Trading to Extend Rally,"
Major indexes closed slightly higher Tuesday as the stock market continued its recovery from an extended selloff.

The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose fractionally. Stocks had kicked off the week with big gains following news that President Trump could scale back some of the tariffs that are due to be imposed next week on U.S. trading partners. With the recent gains, the Dow has inched back into positive territory for 2025, as stocks have rebounded from a month-long selloff spurred by concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.

Investors brushed off consumer confidence data released this morning that came in weaker than expected, with the index hitting its lowest level in more than four years. Investors are closing watching all data points amid worries that tariffs could reignite inflation and cause economic growth to stall. The big economic report of the week comes Friday with the scheduled release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had fallen during the recent stock market rout amid the growing concerns about the economy, was at 4.32% in late trading, down from 4.33% at yesterday's close and from an earlier high Tuesday of 4.37%. The yield, which affects costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, hit its highest level in more than a month this morning.

Mega-cap technology stocks, which helped lead Monday's rally, were mostly higher again today. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied late in the day to finish 3.5% higher, gaining ground for the 5th consecutive session, despite news Tuesday that the EV maker's sales in Europe continued to slide. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) each rose more than 1%, while Microsoft (MSFT) inched ahead. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) closed slightly lower

2025-03-21 01:54:15,r/stocks,Short sellers have made $15 billion betting against Tesla and Nvidia in 2025,"Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Tesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven — which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) — is underperforming the S&amp;P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

Now, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.

""Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,"" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. ""But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market. They are not going away.""

2025-03-20 07:08:52,r/stocks,A Deeper Dive on Trump's Tariffs and Market Positioning,"Trump’s latest trade policies are hammering the markets—S&amp;P 500 down \~9%, Nasdaq off \~12%—and it looks like he’s doubling down. Tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU are back on the table, with zero indication that he’s backing down. While some sectors (steel, domestic manufacturing) stand to benefit, others (tech, autos, multinational retailers) are getting crushed. The question is: at what point does the market pain force Trump to change course?

The **2025 Trade Policy Agenda** lays out his vision:

✅ **Tariffs as leverage** – forcing trade partners into more “reciprocal” deals

✅ **USMCA review (2026)** – questioning whether Canada &amp; Mexico are benefiting unfairly

✅ **Hardline stance on China** – blaming it for the U.S. trade deficit and pushing for stricter enforcement of trade agreements

His strategy? **Drive U.S. production up, cut reliance on imports, and force foreign partners to play by his rules.** But markets are worried about **inflation, supply chain disruption, and retaliatory tariffs**—all of which are starting to bite.

Not every company is hurting—some stand to **benefit significantly** from Trump’s protectionist approach. Trump’s tariffs **shield domestic manufacturers from foreign competition**, making U.S. steel, aluminum, and energy companies prime beneficiaries. E.g 

* **U.S. Steel** X 25% steel tariffs will boost profits
* **Cleveland-Cliffs** CLF Increased demand for domestic steel
* **Nucor** NUE Largest U.S. steel producer, stronger pricing power
* **Anheuser-Busch** BUD Domestic production = insulated from trade costs
* **Prologis** PLD Companies stockpiling goods = warehouse demand surge
* **Lockheed Martin** LMT Defense spending likely to rise under Trump
* **Marathon Petroleum** MPC Energy independence push favors domestic refiners

Companies with **complex supply chains** and reliance on **overseas production** are getting squeezed by **higher input costs and potential retaliatory tariffs**.E.g

* **Apple** AAPL Major China exposure, supply chain at risk
* **Tesla** TSLA Higher costs across supply chain, could hurt margins
* **General Motors** GM Tariffs on parts increase manufacturing costs
* **Ford** F Supply chain disruptions could impact production
* **Nike** NKE Manufacturing in China = higher import costs
* **Amazon** AMZN Increased cost of goods from global suppliers
* **Boeing** BA Risk of Chinese retaliation cutting aircraft orders 

Are you positioning for a **domestic manufacturing boom**, or do you think **this trade war will spiral into a full-blown recession**? Should we be **buying the dip** in industrials or **shorting overexposed multinationals**?

  
Trump’s strategy is clear: use **tariffs as a multipurpose weapon**, not just for trade but also for **immigration and national security**. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted that **Canada &amp; Mexico could avoid tariffs if they “improve border security” and crack down on fentanyl trafficking**. This suggests Trump is **negotiating in multiple arenas at once**, using economic pressure to force compliance on broader policy goals.

The problem? **Markets hate uncertainty**, and businesses can’t plan if policy keeps shifting based on unrelated factors. While some U.S. industries benefit, long-term uncertainty could hurt investment, expansion, and consumer confidence.",0,0,notllmchatbot,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jfidz3/a_deeper_dive_on_trumps_tariffs_and_market/,1jfidz3

2025-03-19 19:46:11,r/stocks,Apple's 'Siri-Ous' Problem - Here's Why I'm Bearish on AAPL,"Okay, Apple fans (or Cook loyalists), let me finish before you go on a rampage. I'm not putting down Apple's products - the iPhone did change the world, and Siri ...... well, at least the way we interact with our phones. But today, we're talking about stocks, and AAPL is looking more and more like a “shareholder-funded AI experiment”.



Apple's growth is slowing, iPhone sales are weak, and the company's attempts to boost demand with AI features like Apple Intelligence have frequently skipped a beat, with Siri's AI upgrade pushed back to 2026 or possibly even later, and iOS 18's bugs making the user experience even worse. Meanwhile, rivals like Google and Amazon have made significant strides in the AI assistant space.



To make matters worse, Apple's valuation is already ridiculously high, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 29x, well above the S&amp;P 500's 20x. That's clearly unsustainable given its single-digit growth expectations. The irony is that Cook seems to be focusing more on growth in the services business, while innovation in the iPhone as a core product has been weak. So why exactly is this company still worth so much money? How do you see Apple's future? Is it time to reassess its valuation?

2025-03-19 06:55:08,r/stocks,Trump’s Trade War 2.0: The Stocks I’m Watching,"With Trump back in office and tariffs returning in full force, I’ve been analyzing what this means for U.S. equities. His latest moves—25% steel and aluminum tariffs, expanded levies on Chinese imports, and a tariff-heavy negotiation strategy—echo his first term but with even **stronger measures**.



While 2018-2020 gave us some clues, the market setup in 2025 is **different**:

• **Higher inflation &amp; rates:** Tariffs add inflationary pressure, making the Fed’s job harder.

• **China’s response will change:** Unlike in 2018, China now **dominates EV battery production** and **controls rare earth supply chains**—this could hurt U.S. tech more than before.

• **Supply chain resilience is mixed:** Companies have talked about reshoring for years, but it’s still expensive and slow.

Given these factors, here’s how I’m positioning:

**Likely Winners:**

1. **Steel &amp; Aluminum (NUE, STLD, CLF)** – Tariffs give them pricing power, though cost inflation is a risk.

2. **Defense &amp; Cybersecurity (LMT, PLTR, CRWD)** – “America First” likely means **higher defense budgets**.

3. **Regional Banks (JPM, BAC, GS)** – If deregulation follows, these should gain.

4. **Domestic Infrastructure (CAT, DE, OSK)** – If tariffs hurt foreign suppliers, U.S. construction demand rises.



**Likely Losers:**

1. **Tech Giants (AAPL, NVDA, QCOM, INTC)** – Heavy China exposure = supply chain and revenue risks.

2. **Consumer Goods (NKE, WMT, DG)** – Imports get pricier, and passing costs to lower-income customers is tough.

3. **Auto &amp; Industrial (TSLA, GM, F, MMM)** – Higher input costs + China retaliation = pain.

4. **Agri Exporters (ADM, TSN, BG)** – If China targets U.S. farm products again, these get hit.



**What I’m watching:**

📌 Will China retaliate with rare earth metal export bans? (Impacts TSLA, NVDA, QCOM)

📌 Do inflation expectations rise, pushing Fed policy hawkish? (Bad for rate-sensitive stocks)

📌 Does Trump backtrack on any tariffs? (A la 2019)

📌 Will domestic manufacturing gains **outweigh** supply chain disruptions?

I’d love to hear counterpoints. Which stocks do you think will **outperform or underperform** in Trump’s Trade War 2.0?",473,227,notllmchatbot,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jeqaup/trumps_trade_war_20_the_stocks_im_watching/,1jeqaup

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-03-11 18:12:13,r/stocks,Trump's DOJ wants a Google breakup but is willing to leave AI alone,"President Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, now largely agree on a major point that has the potential to reshape the tech world: Google should be broken up.

But there is an important difference that emerged in a filing last Friday: Trump’s Justice Department wants to let Google (GOOG, GOOGL) keep its investments in artificial intelligence. It notably has a stake in OpenAI rival Anthropic worth billions.

Backing off the Biden administration's request to force Google to sell off its AI bets was ""significant"" and ""very justified,"" said Mark McCareins, a business law professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.

It ""may be an indication that the government worries about deterring AI advances in the global race with China,"" added David Olson, associate law professor at Boston College Law School.

The stock of Google's parent, Alphabet, dropped more than 4% Monday as other tech stocks also sold off on macroeconomic concerns.

The final decision on what happens to Google's $2 trillion empire in court will be in the hands of federal judge Amit Mehta, who ruled last August that Google illegally monopolized online markets for ""general search"" and ""general search text.”

No matter what Mehta decides, Google is expected to appeal, and the DOJ can too. Hearings to decide on remedies in this case are slated for April and May.

Final remedy recommendations from the government and Google were due to the judge Friday, giving a Trump-led DOJ one last chance to alter the prior Biden-era suggestion to the judge that Google be broken up with the forced sale of Google’s Chrome browser or contingent sale of its Android operating system.

It didn’t do so, despite being lobbied by the company to reconsider the Chrome proposal on national security concerns.

""Google must divest the Chrome browser — an important search access point,"" the DOJ stated in its final proposal on Friday.

It argued that under a different owner, new rivals would have an “opportunity to operate a significant gateway to search the internet, free of Google’s monopoly control.”

They also retained part of a request to leave the door open to a possible divestiture of Google's Android operating system.

But prosecutors did drop the Biden DOJ's push for Google to sell off its AI bets, instead suggesting a setup where federal authorities could keep tabs on proposed AI investments that could threaten search competition.

Anthropic has argued to the judge that forcing Google to relinquish its stake would tilt the AI playing field in favor of OpenAI and its backer, Microsoft (MSFT).

“Plaintiffs no longer seek the mandatory divestiture of Google’s AI investments,” the DOJ said Friday in its revised proposal.

Derek Mountford, a shareholder in Gunster's business litigation practice group who specializes in antitrust litigation, said while the Trump administration's AI rollback is a concession, it comes with a hook.

""They're asking for some reporting requirements to be attached to it,"" he said.

""I think one of the [antitrust] themes you might see in a second Trump administration is even if they're walking back some of the proposed sanctions, there's still that element of control and monitoring and enforcement that's going on in the background.""

The tension for the Trump administration, Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich told Yahoo Finance last week, is that it is engaged in an existential fight with China for the future of AI and Google can still be an important weapon for the US.

""What are we going to do, hobble one of our main US runners in that race by breaking up that company?” asked Kovacevich, who previously led Google's US policy strategy and external affairs team.

""It seems ill-timed to do that.""

The DOJ did stick with another expected remedy proposal that strikes at a major contention in the case.

It asked the judge to block Google from contracts that secure its search engine as the default across dozens of internet-connected devices, such as mobile phones made by Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and others, and browsers, including Apple’s Safari and Mozilla’s Firefox.

That is not good news for Apple, jeopardizing a major revenue stream. In 2021, Google paid $26 billion for default search placements, and the lion's share of that went to Apple.

Bernstein analysts have estimated Apple’s revenue from Google Search defaults is somewhere between $18 billion and $20 billion per year.

Google countered the DOJ’s request on Friday by asking that it still be free to enter into contracts to make Google search a default — so long as it does not condition search licensing based on device manufacturers also agreeing to distribute, preload, place, display, use, or license its AI Gemini Assistant Application.

McCareins, the law professor at Kellogg, said the DOJ has little to lose at this stage by holding on to Chrome divestment as a negotiating chip, given that both the underlying case and the judge's decision on remedies are subject to appeal.

""Just from a bargaining negotiating position, at this stage of the proceedings, I am not shocked or stunned that the new sheriffs in town have continued to argue for divestiture of Chrome,"" McCareins said.

2025-03-03 16:52:45,r/stocks,"Trump, Chip Maker TSMC Expected to Announce $100 Billion Investment in U.S.","WASHINGTON—Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. 2330 -1.92%decrease; red down pointing triangle intends to invest $100 billion in chip-manufacturing plants in the U.S. over the next four years under a plan expected to be announced later Monday by President Trump, according to people familiar with the matter.

The investment would be used to build out cutting-edge chip-making facilities. Such an expansion would advance a long-pursued U.S. goal to regrow the domestic semiconductor industry after manufacturing fled largely to Asian countries in recent decades.

TSMC, the world’s largest contract chip-maker, set down roots in Arizona in 2020, when it said it would build a chip factory there for $12 billion. Its ambitions for the site have expanded rapidly since, with two more factories on the same site and a total investment of $65 billion. The company’s first factory began mass production late last year.

TSMC’s announcement comes after years of deliberation regarding the future of semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. and the global tech sector. The company currently builds its most advanced chip-making facilities only on its home soil Taiwan. The chips it produces are critical for powering everything from the latest artificial-intelligence systems to smartphones.

Since the Biden administration, the U.S. has expressed concerns about TSMC’s near-monopoly on advanced chip manufacturing and has been urging the company to relocate more of its cutting-edge production, including advanced chip-packaging facilities, to the U.S. Advanced chip packaging is particularly critical for AI-related chips, as it enhances performance by integrating multiple semiconductor components, reducing size, improving power efficiency, and ensuring faster data transfer—key factors for AI applications.

[awarded up to $6.6 billion of grants](https://www.wsj.com/tech/taiwanese-chip-making-giant-tsmc-gets-6-6-billion-for-arizona-project-f75e9de4?mod=article_inline), and has recently begun to receive federal money from the program. Generous tax credits have also boosted chip-making projects in the U.S.

“We’re pleased to have an opportunity to meet with the President and look forward to discussing our shared vision for innovation and growth in the semiconductor industry, as well as exploring ways to bolster the technology sector along with our customers,” TSMC said in a statement.

U.S. officials see chip-making as a national-security imperative because economies, technological advancement and military might all are increasingly dependent on who has the best chips. Covid-era supply-chain issues also highlighted the critical nature of the industry when shortages of chips led to slowdowns in auto sales, among other disruptions.

Trump has repeatedly called for more chip manufacturing in the U. S.—although he criticized the Chips Act on the campaign trail and argued the better way to attract manufacturing was through tariffs. Last month, he said he was considering a 25% or more tariff on semiconductor imports.

“We have to have chips made in this country. Right now, everything is made in Taiwan, practically, almost all of it, a little bit in South Korea, but everything—almost all of it is made in Taiwan. And we want it to be made—we want those companies to come to our country, in all due respect,” Trump said in February.

Since taking office, Trump has appeared at the White House with the chief executives of several companies to announce pledges to invest in the U.S. The details of the projects are often vague and it is often unclear whether the pledges represent [new investments by the companies](https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-corporate-new-job-investment-what-to-expect-ad19993c?mod=article_inline).

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-02-27 16:13:55,r/stocks,Reddit picks winners!,"Year after year Reddit picks the winners! I have kept a close eye on this subreddit for the last 10-15 years and have always been amazed by how ahead of the curve we are. Here is a list of stocks that have been heavily discussed over the years that have performed very well: 

- Tesla 
- Shopify 
- Block
- NVDA 
- AMD 
- PLTR
- AAPL 
- GME

I know everyone in the comments is going to claim this is selection bias, but I can assure you these stocks were talked about so much it is unmistakable. People will also claim but these stocks have tanked since then! They have had significant corrections, but if you bought them when the buzz began you are still significantly in the green.  We will have to wait and see what the future holds. 

 But what about the losers like movie pass!? Of course, some losers have been overly hyped too, but they are far less common. Also, in my opinion, the tone around stocks like movie pass is totally different than a stock like NVDA or SHOP. 

The beautiful part about Reddit is you hear both sides, SHOP had a great deal of resistance back in 2017 and still does. A lot of people claimed it was a worthless company. People like Andrew Left were worshipped for shorting the company. But at the end of the day it was posted about non stop and has performed extremely well. People were also screaming from the top of the mountain that NVDA was overpriced in 2017, look where that ended up. 

Lately it feels like we have entered a new “hype” cycle where a lot of new names have been heavily mentioned. Similar to the hype cycle of 2016-2017 there is a lot of resistance and great discussions behind had. Here are some new names that I have noticed being posted about non stop: 

- RKLB
- IONQ 
- BBAI
- CAVA 
- LUNR
- SMCI
- OKLO 
- BRO

I have been seeing these tickers fly around lately and see a lot of promise in them. They have performed very well in the past 6 months to a year, but we will have to wait and see where they end up in the long term. 

It’s a common meme to short every stock Reddit mentions, but I ultimately disagree. The hive mind is a very powerful and can seemingly predict the future. Keep in mind, the hive mind is what sets the vegas spreads. 

Anyway, that’s my rant for the day. I am sure 75% of you will disagree with me, but again, thats why I love Reddit. Would love to hear your opinions. 

Also, I have holdings in most of the companies listed. This is not financial advice. Do your own due diligence before buying any company I listed. ",49,48,DoU92,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1izi0k0/reddit_picks_winners/,1izi0k0

2025-02-25 12:48:08,r/stocks,On Market Timing,"You cannot time the market, but there are times when it is due for a crash. At those times you definitely don’t want to buy on the dips, and you want to sell a bit more on the rips. Major market declines can happen really fast (think of the flash crash), but major declines like 2000 and 2008 give you notice that they’re coming. **Crashes occur when a majority of investors are just wrong about something big.** If you want to make money on stocks over the long run, it’s good to see the crashes coming. I’m pretty sure that one is coming now. I'm a successful investor with 30 years in equities. Let me review my experience in the dot com crash and the 2008 financial crisis.

I started investing significantly in 1996, when I got a better paying job. It was fun. You could identify new technologies and hold on for meteoric rise. I made a lot on IOM and AFFX. But it was clear that the market did not actually understand the internet. A company could double its market capitalization by getting a web site and renaming itself a dot com. Valuations reflected the mistaken idea that doing exactly the same business online was somehow going to be much more profitable. I remember realizing that I owned stocks that were worth far more than the underlying value of the company, but kept going up. I developed a rule (sell a third every time it triples) to get my money back while continuing to profit from the insanity. When things started to turn south, it didn’t take a genius to get out. When the bleeding stopped, I was early to get back in, looking for stocks that found support (low volume on down days) during the crash. Among the stocks I bought in 2001, I’ve done the best with AAPL.

The other big bear market I went through was 2008. Again, the fall can be traced to something that the majority of investors had wrong. I remember talking to a mortgage broker in 2004. They were pushing balloon mortgages and other nonsense that allowed people to buy houses they could not afford. I asked about the terms, and realized that shit would hit the fan in 2007 or 2008. It was not hard to see. There were a lot of these mortgages. As a homeowner, I got cold calls inviting me to refinance my 30 year fixed with something that would have a lower rate for a few years before exploding. Again, the economy was headed in the wrong direction because the market somehow thought these were safe. I can’t claim to have seen the crash coming (I thought the damage would be limited to foolish homeowners), but leveraged collateralized mortgage obligations set financial markets up for a fall. My point is that, once again, the market fell because the market was just wrong about something, and eventually reality could no longer be ignored.

We’re here again. A lot of people think Trump/DOGE will be good for business. Taxes will be cut and government waste eliminated. They do not understand how the parts of government being eliminated are good for business. I’ll give you three examples. First, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been eliminated, or at least crippled. The idea is that less regulation is a good thing. But without that protection, more consumers are going to be subject to scams, and the more sophisticated are not going to use services like X Money at all, because they are no longer safe. Second, there have been huge cuts to funding for science (NIH, USDA, NSF, etc.) with almost no attempt to identify what spending is actually wasteful. Innovation comes from science, so this will be very very bad for business over the long run. Third, DOGE cancelled legal contracts for government services with no warning. Even if you think that providing services to refugees is wasteful, it’s not fraudulent, and the American businesses who had those contracts were obviously hurt, as was trust in the government. 

Is it too late to avoid disaster? Maybe not, but I don’t see Donald Trump saying “oops” anytime soon.

So, we’re there again. The market will fall because the market is wrong about something big.

2025-02-23 18:46:53,r/stocks,"Warren Buffett sounds warning to Washington as Berkshire reports record profit, cash","https://www.reuters.com/business/warren-buffett-says-us-should-spend-wisely-plans-increase-investment-japan-2025-02-22/?utm_source=reddit.com

NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), opens new tab on Saturday reported record annual profits and boosting its cash stake to $334.2 billion, as Warren Buffett used his annual shareholder letter to caution Washington to spend money wisely and take care of those who get the ""short straws in life.""

Buffett's admonition came as many investors worry U.S. lawmakers won't rein in soaring fiscal deficits, and could make them worse by extending tax cuts backed by President Donald Trump.

The 94-year-old Buffett, the world's sixth-richest person and arguably its most famous investor, also acknowledged his advanced age, telling shareholders he uses a cane and will spend less time fielding their questions at Berkshire's annual meeting on May 3.

He nonetheless assured shareholders they would be in good hands after he turns over the conglomerate's reins to Vice Chairman Greg Abel, saying the 62-year-old Abel has ""vividly shown his ability"" to deploy capital.

""It won't be long"" before Abel takes over, Buffett said.

Buffett's letter was accompanied by Berkshire's annual report, where it reported a third straight record annual operating profit, rising 27% to $47.44 billion.

Quarterly operating profit rose 71% to $14.53 billion, also a record, and which analysts viewed as solid.

Net income for the full year totaled $89 billion, including gains from Berkshire's common stock investments such as Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab and American Express (AXP.N), opens new tab.

Berkshire's cash stake reflected high business valuations and nine straight quarters of selling more stocks than it bought. The selling included Apple, which remained its largest stock investment.

""Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities,"" Buffett wrote.

'FISCAL FOLLY'

This year is Buffett's 60th at the helm of Berkshire, which he transformed from a failing textile company into a $1.03 trillion conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance, railroad, energy, industrial, retail and other sectors.

""Berkshire's activities now impact all corners of our country. And we are not finished,"" Buffett said.

Buffett said Berkshire will continue preferring equities, primarily U.S. stocks, over cash, even as it resists paying a dividend to shareholders, which it has not done since 1967.

He said reinvesting in Berkshire is one reason the Omaha, Nebraska-based company paid $26.8 billion of federal taxes last year, 5% of all payments by corporate America. Buffett himself is worth $149.5 billion, Forbes magazine said,
But he also sent a cautionary message to Washington, lamenting how capitalism ""has its faults and abuses--in certain respects more egregious now than ever,"" with malfeasance by ""scoundrels and promoters"" in full force.

He urged lawmakers to help preserve a stable U.S. dollar, saying ""fiscal folly"" can destroy the value of paper money and the country has at times ""come close to the edge.""

Buffett said long-term success of Berkshire and the American economy, which he called the ""American miracle,"" has depended on people's ability to participate.

That, he said, is something Uncle Sam can encourage, or take away.

""Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better,"" Buffett wrote, addressing the government.
""And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on your part,"" he added.

Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who rates Berkshire ""hold,"" said: ""Talking about the business of America being messy was his way of addressing the political landscape and its impact on the macroeconomic environment. He is warning Washington: Be careful where you tread.""

FEWER BUYING OPPORTUNITIES

While Berkshire has not made a major purchase of an entire company since 2016, Buffett said it is likely to increase its combined $23.5 billion of investments in five Japanese trading houses: Itochu (8001.T), opens new tab, Marubeni (8002.T), opens new tab, Mitsubishi (8058.T), opens new tab, Mitsui (8031.T), opens new tab and Sumitomo (8053.T), opens new tab.

Other stocks appear pricey, with the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 (.SPX), opens new tab hitting a new high on Wednesday and the Nasdaq (.IXIC), opens new tab just 3% below its December 16 peak.

Berkshire's size also inhibits its shares from trouncing the indexes, as they did decades ago.
The company's stock price has risen 15% in the last year, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 18%.

Over the last decade, Berkshire's stock price has risen 225%, while the index rose 241% including dividends and 185% excluding dividends, Reuters data show.

""They will have lots of buying opportunities but Berkshire will never be the large double-digit compounder it had been,"" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management in Phoenix.

At Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett will spend less time on the stage in a downtown Omaha arena where he, Abel and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will answer shareholder questions.

Tens of thousands of people attend the meeting and a weekend of shareholder events, including shopping.

Buffett told Fortune magazine last month that he was still having fun and able to do a few things reasonably well, while other activities had been ""eliminated or greatly minimized.""

The meeting will also not feature the traditional movie created by Buffett's daughter Susie.
In discussing his age, Buffett said he talks regularly on Sundays with his 91-year-old sister Bertie, using an old-fashioned phone.

""We cover the joys of old age and discuss such exciting topics as the relative merits of our canes,"" he said. ""In my case, the utility is limited to the avoidance of falling flat on my face.""

Palantir has been on a tear recently, all hyped up on the defense sector growth but no one is really paying attention to Meta Defense and their entry to the space. Last year Meta opened up its AI models to defense agencies and contractors. This is huge for them to get this level of clearance and i think this will will put them in direct competition with Palantir. Im not sure how they build out this branch of Meta, Im calling it Meta Defense but they fired all their woke people and are starting to re-shape the company.

Yes, there is defense spending cuts but its all on waste and overcharged contracts not on things that actually matter for the dept of defense. During the inauguration Zuckerberg was in the front row, Hegseth was somewhere in the back. Just an observation.

Everyone is familiar with their social media business so there isnt a whole lot to talk about there. AI keeps improving, More growth from Reels, Threads, Facebook. Their LLM is impressive and arguably one of the best, putting them up there with OpenAI.

With all there user data they have Meta Analytics could be another source of revenue.

They are sitting on a goldmine with Facebook market place. i get they have ads but i feel they could do more.  Im not sure Zuckerberg realized what he has there but this business if monetized right could be HUGE.

2025-02-17 16:53:51,r/AAPL,Foreign Exchange Impacts on Apple's Earnings,,4,0,[deleted],/r/stocks/comments/1irmza9/foreign_exchange_impacts_on_apples_earnings/,1irmzng
2025-02-17 16:53:25,r/stocks,Foreign Exchange Impacts on Apple's Earnings,"**Foreign Exchange Impacts on Apple**

The US dollar (USDXY) can have a huge impact on Apple’s revenue and earnings as around 50% of Apple’s sales occur internationally. Much of the past ten years the USDXY has hovered in the 92-98 range. When COVID-19 hit in March 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate and the USDXY hovered in the 89-95 range for a majority of the second half of 2021 through early 2022. In early 2022 the Federal reserve started to hike the federal funds rate and did so through the end of 2023. From mid-2022 through today the USDXY has hovered in the 103-113 range. This is is a 10-25% difference. The elevated USDXY poses significant revenue headwinds for Apple as it costs Apple much more to convert back to US dollars on foreign revenue and it also can lead to lower sales volume as Apple has to raise prices in foreign countries to help offset a strong USDXY. A strong USDXY can help Apple when it comes to foreign investment and international expenses, but the revenue and sales impact outweighs any gains in the cost area. Tim Cook cites in Apple’s Q1 2023 earnings call that foreign exchange (FX) impacts had a “nearly 800 basis point impact,” on revenue. In Apple’s latest Q1 2025 earnings call Tim Cook stated that FX would have a negative 2.5% impact on revenue, but that is YoY not compared to 2021 meaning on a constant currency basis compared to 2021 it would be close to the 6-8% range. Below is a five-year chart of the USDXY. Let’s take a look at Apple’s fiscal year 2024 performance with a 6% constant currency adjustment to revenue to compare to FY 2021 on a constant currency basis.

**FY 2024 Example**

Apple’s total net sales in FY 2024 was $391 billion. With a constant currency 6% adjustment it would be $415 billion. Apple’s total cost of sales for FY 2024 was $210 billion. If we add in a 6% negative impact for a weakened USDXY it would be $223 billion. This would mean Apple’s gross margins would have been 52.8% instead of the reported 46.2% for FY 2024. Apple’s adjusted diluted EPS for FY 2024 would have been around $7.55/share vs the reported $6.75 adjusting for the one-tax payment made in Q4 2024. Here is the math:

Revenue: $415 billion

Cost of Sales: $223 billion

Operation Expenses: $57.5 billion

Effective Tax Rate: 15.8%

Total Outstanding Shares: \~15 billion

($415 -$223)=gross margin -($57.5) = operating income \*(15.8%)= ($113.25)/15=$7.55

As you can see, FY 2024 EPS would have been 12% higher on a constant currency basis compared to FY 2021. Gross margin would have been 660 basis points higher. The strong USDXY has a significant impact on Apple’s earnings. I think the second half of FY 2025 FY 2026 could be a big growth year for Apple on paper if the USDXY weakens and Apple’s hardware replacement cycle follows its normal 3–4-year cycle. The last big upgrade cycle took place during the end of 2020-2021.

My thought process is as follows (again, only considering non-dividend stocks): 

The only thing moving the needle is speculation. If AAPL made 1bil more than expected, the stock doesn’t move until the information is available and people start speciation whether it’s good to buy/sell this information. 

Since all the money is just a pooled from the traders, it’s zero sum? It’s not a zero sum wager (winning from another’s loss) but it certainly sounds like zero sum 

Say a stock has 10 investors each having $100 invested. The moment 1/2 of them cash out, the other 1/2 would be left with $50 each, cuz money got taken from the pool and no new money came in

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Right now I have 13k in a taxable account and 12k in a Roth.  I'm putting about $500 each month into those accounts.

My strategy at first was to play it safer with ETFs, but the more I researched the returns and data, the more I gradually sold those positions in favor of individual stocks.  I want to be aggressive and grow my portfolio, but I don't want to be reckless--at my age I have a LOT of catching up to do.  I've built a somewhat aggressive portfolio, heavy in tech and finance.  I believe in all of these stocks, but I'm wondering--should diversify by opening new positions in different sectors, or if I would be better off grow the positions I have now? Or is it diverse enough because it's many different companies?  For reference, this is roughly the breakdown of both portfolios. Should I continue to grow these positions (and if so, where would you focus? I really like Visa), or buy in other areas like NVO, etc?  Part of me feels like I'm ""supposed to"" diversify, but realistically I don't think Microsoft or Apple or Meta or going anywhere anytime soon, I think they all will continue to grow as they utilize AI in new ways, and the returns seem to have been pretty consistently higher than other sectors.  So is it worth it to diversify with other sectors?  Or is it already diverse because I have many different positions?

A top Apple (AAPL) stock analyst says the consumer electronics giant is mulling whether to make a humanoid robot.

In a post on social network X on Wednesday, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple is exploring both humanoid and nonhumanoid robots as part of its future smart-home ecosystem.

""These products are still in the early proof-of-concept (POC) stage internally,"" Kuo said. ""Given current progress and typical development cycles, Apple's robot mass production likely won't start until 2028 or later.""

""Interestingly, Apple has been unusually open about sharing some of its robotics research during the early POC stage — possibly to attract talent,"" he added.

Kuo cautioned that Apple is still very early in the product development cycle. The proof-of-concept stage is a ""testing ground"" used to determine whether core technologies and product ideas are viable before proceeding.

Apple's rumored foldable iPhone is also in the proof-of-concept stage, he said.

""However, many projects never progress beyond POC — the Apple Car is probably the most notable example of a project that got stuck at this stage,"" Kuo said.",51,21,r2002,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1inyfc8/apple_interested_in_making_humanoid_robot_top/,1inyfc8
2025-02-10 22:06:18,r/AAPL,Apple’s Expanding Margins: An Underrated Earnings Story,"Gross Margins Analysis
Apple's gross margins started expanding again in 2021 as seen in the chart below provided by FinBox:
  [image] 

Gross margin expansion is an underrated story for Apple and it can be a quite impactful story for Apple's earnings in the upcoming quarters. Much of Apple's recent accelerated gross margin expansion can be attributed to the growth of their Services segment. Services has recently seen gross margins in the 70-75% range and the business keeps growing as displayed by its recent 14% YoY revenue growth in Q1 2025. Apple's products gross margins tends to hover in the 30-40% range. In Apple's Fiscal Year 2020, overall gross margin was 38.2%. Its products gross margin was 31.5% and its services gross margin was 66.0% In fiscal year 2024, Apple' s overall gross margin was 46.2%. Its products gross margin was 37.2% and its services gross margin was 73.9%. Overall, gross margins grew by 800 basis points and at an annualized rate of 5%. This is very good growth on its own, but the margins would be even higher in 2024 on a constant currency basis. For instance, the United States dollar index (USDXY) was 10-15% higher in 2024 compared to much of 2020. Apple has cited 5-8% currency headwinds on revenue in 2024 earnings calls compared to 2020 and 2021 quarters. If you apply a 6% impact to Apple's 2024 revenue, gross margins would have been closer to 49%-50%. I believe Apple's products margins can keep expanding as they continue to become more vertically integrated by designing their own chips, modems, etc. I also think as they keep selling more units this creates an even better economies of scale scenario.

Impact of Gross Margin Expansion on Earnings

If Apple's gross margins keep expanding this will have a positive impact on earnings. For example, if Apple's revenue grows 6% to $415 billion in fical year 2025 and gross margins grow by 5% to 48.5%, this would add approximately $10 billion in gross margin for Apple when comparing to their FY24 margins of 46.2%. At a 16% tax rate, this $10 billion results in an extra $.56 in earnings per share (EPS). The math behind this is $8.4 billion after the taxes are deducted divided by Apple's total outstanding share count which stands around 15 billion.  Here is an example to illustrate how important this is for Apple. If EPS for FY 2025 is $7.80 versus $7.24, this is an extra 7.7% in earnings growth. If the abnormally high USDXY normalizes and weakens by 5-10% that could add 4% in revenue. This would improve Apple's gross margins to around 50.4% and add another $.50 to Apple's earnings. As you can see, Apple does not need extreme revenue growth to keep growing their earnings at a respectable rate. Continued gross margin expansion and the normalizing of the USDXY is an underrated story for Apple that can have a huge impact on earnings growth.

2025-01-31 17:46:00,r/stocks,"AAPL - 26,527.62% return over 25 years","Today to the day is the anniversary of twenty five years of my first purchase of AAPL shares.  I bought 1200 dollars worth.

In early 2000, I had just graduated college.  I had a few thousand given to me as an inheritance that was being managed by a broker.

 I asked the broker about purchasing some Apple shares, and he was unimpressed, and unmoved. I was annoyed at him. Apple was the one I had the strongest impulse to purchase.

 Why apple? I had gone from being skeptical of Apple. My  college was very heavily Mac, but I had PCs.  I was unimpressed at the OS, but I was struck by people’s reactions to Jobs.  He was enthusiastic, and I liked the cut of the jib who liked the cut of his jib. I was drawn to the elitism of the people to the brand, and felt it could bounce back. This was even before iPods, mind you, before OS X.  

These were the days of the dotcom boom. This broker was taking like 500 bucks for every trade. This felt unfair, in light of the great digital democratization that was in progress, I wanted the power.  And E*trade was relatively new and it seemed legit.  I hadn’t done anything like this before, I was just a kid, really, but I decided to just go for it. 

I sold most of the shares I inherited, and threw 1200 bucks into Apple.  `(also a few other, less impressive stocks)' I did marvelously the first few months as the market soared, as did most people. 

And…. it  came tumbling down in April 2000.  Disillusioned, I decided not to try to reposition my shares, and I just let things ride for a few months.  When I rebalanced by portfolio, I kept my apple shares, which had split, despite the pull-back.

Every year, I would consider would I buy more apple now?  And it didn't occurr me to sell. Apple often seemed almost comically undervalued, and I held on or increased my investment in it.

Every time apple goes up 1 point, I get more than my initial investment back. Why? Splits.

•	2-for-1 split in 2000  
•	2-for-1 split in 2005  
•	7-for-1 split in 2014  
•	4-for-1 split in 2020

Nowadays cost basis: .88 cents.     As of today that investment has grown 26,527.62%. I added more and more apple across the years, and had some other lucky calls (my second largest holding is NVDA) but no move matches that whimsical lucky move of 25 years ago today.

The security that owning these securities has offered me is significant.  It has let me have a job that isn’t that well-payed and support my family with emergencies being take of by extra funds. We own a lot of apple products, because with the dividends, it sort of just pays for them.

I do think it’s good to give early adults access to a few thousand dollars to play the market and plan to do that with my own children.  Although I didn’t sell my shares, what I did do is convert a bunch of them to a donor advised fund (avoiding taxes, whee), and I give to charity from that for annual giving, and that feels like a win win win proposition.  

I do feel overexposed in AAPL and NVDA, but due to still hopefully having another at least 25 years to go in my life is that pullbacks eventually come back up. The biggest principle that has guided my investing is “Don’t buy crap if you can help it”, and that's my advice to new investors.",1148,160,leontes,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iej3mb/aapl_2652762_return_over_25_years/,1iej3mb
2025-01-31 15:19:09,r/stocks,These are the stocks on my watchlist (01/31),"This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed!

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

Catalyst I'm looking out for today- NVDA CEO to meet with White House officials, and server capex cost for DeepSeek estimated to be almost $1.3B. Deepseek capabilities are expected to be copied by US firms.

News: [Fed's Favored Inflation Gauge Posted Muted Advance In December](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-31/fed-s-favored-inflation-gauge-posted-muted-advance-in-december)

Ticker: [AAPL (Apple Inc.)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&amp;p=d)

Catalyst: Apple reported EPS of $2.40 vs. $2.35, and revenue of $124.3B vs 124B.

Despite these positive results, the company provided cautious guidance for the upcoming quarter, citing uncertainties related to the impact of new AI features on sales. Tim Cook mentioned that Apple Intelligence DID lead to stronger sales/growth in areas where it was rolled out (it has limited rollout right now).

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Watching $250 level, no strong bias. We've seen AAPL swing close to 20% this month, (on report of sales weakness in China) but doubt this will continue.

Context: Most immediate news that comes to mind was the weakness of sales in China for the iPhone, causing the move this month.

Risks: Don't really see immediate risks beyond the trade war, in 2019/2020 this resulted in AAPL moving manufacturing/production to other countries in South East Asia- slowing growth in China has been pretty consistent, however.

Related Tickers: rest of FAANG, Samsung if you can trade overseas stocks, the various phone component manufacturers that trade with AAPL

Offhand: Apple is investing in its own high-speed network infrastructure to enhance content delivery, (just like META's undersea pipeline)

Ticker: [ACMR (ACM Research, Inc.)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ACMR&amp;p=d)

Catalyst: Kerrisdale Capital released a bullish report on ACM Research (ACMR), a semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) company positioned in China but headquartered in America.

It leads China as a leading supplier of wafer cleaning tools and beneficiary of China's push toward semiconductor self-sufficiency.

Kerrisdale predicts the company to eventually compete globally and cites it as a potential 10x return. Trades at 1x 2025E revenue (likely due to China fears).

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: This is the interesting part- ACMR holds a $1.2B mkt cap but trades at a massive discount compared to its Chinese subsidiary (ACMS), which has a $5.9 billion market cap and trades at 6x 2025E revenue.

The report suggests that ACMR’s NASDAQ valuation is severely mispriced and could re-rate significantly as investors recognize the valuation gap.

Context: China/US chip war, you guys know what this is.

Sector Context: The global semiconductor industry is shifting, with China attempting to localize chip production.

Kerrisdale argues that restrictions on U.S. and Japanese WFE exports to China will only fuel ACMR’s growth as Chinese fabs increasingly turn to domestic suppliers.

China's WFE self-sufficiency has grown from 4% in 2019 to 17% in 2024 and is expected to reach 36% by 2026.

Risks: Geopolitical factors, including further U.S. export restrictions, could impact ACMR’s operations. Similar to how we have the NVDA trade restriction going on right now. However, Kerrisdale sees these restrictions as a net positive due to ACMR having less competition in China as a result. There are other players in the WFE space in China, but ACMR has a technological moat.

Ticker: [INTC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&amp;p=d)

Catalyst: Intel reported revenue of $14.26B vs exp of $13.81B. Most important, the company anticipated breakeven EPS next quarter.

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Somewhat rangebound for the past 3 months. Watching $20 but nothing interesting I'm watching beyond that.

Context: This earnings report is Intel's first since the departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger. Right now INTC is being led by two interim co-CEOs, and another price catalyst that could potentially happen is someone competent being picked lol. Also worth thinking of the NVDA/Deepseek/semiconductor news when reading through these catalysts.

Intel has also announced a delay in its Falcon Shores GPU and only using it internally within the company.

Risks: Intel faces significant competition from companies such as NVIDIA and AMD, the delay of their chip is pretty bad news.

Related Tickers: AMD/NVDA/TSM

Ticker: [ASTS](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&amp;p=d)

Catalyst: ASTS has received special temporary authority from the FCC to test its space-based cellular broadband network in the United States. Allows for collaboration efforts with VZ/T.

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Slight rise, but will watch this at open to see if volume comes in.

Context: The FCC's authorization allows ASTS to provide cell/satellite comms, allowing for greater coverage and signals that more use of ASTS satellites. I remember that the company was essentially valued based on each satellite they launched successfully in 2024, whether that hype returns remains to be seen but overall not interested in trading this unless we have retail interest again.

Sector Context: SpaceX's Starlink is also entering the direct-to-cell market, as I noted a few days ago- most of the investment that can be done in these type of cell/sat comms in public markets can really only be done in ASTS.

Risks: If SpaceX IPOs we might see a selloff in this stock simply because SpaceX is far larger/established and Elon Musk has closer ties to the government.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Services revenue: $26.34 billion vs. $26.09 billion estimated 

Gross margin: 46.9% vs. 46.5% estimated 

 Although Apple’s overall sales rose during the quarter, the company’s closely watched iPhone sales actually declined slightly on a year-over-year basis. The December quarter is the first full quarter with iPhone 16 sales, and Apple released its Apple Intelligence AI suite for the devices during the quarter.  

Apple’s iPhone miss versus LSEG estimates was the biggest for the company in two years, since its first-quarter earnings report in fiscal 2023. At the time, Apple said that its miss was because it was unable to make enough iPhone 14 models because of production issues in China. 

The company saw significant weakness in Greater China, which includes the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Overall China sales declined 11.1% during the quarter to $18.51 billion. It’s the largest drop in China sales since the same quarter last year when they fell 12.9%. 

Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that iPhone sales were stronger in countries where Apple Intelligence is available. Currently, the software is only available in a handful of English-speaking countries, and it isn’t accessible in China or in Chinese. 

“During the December quarter, we saw that in markets where we had rolled out Apple intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those markets where we had not rolled out Apple intelligence,” Cook said.  

Cook told CNBC that there were three factors in the company’s China performance. He said that half of the 11.1% decline was due to a change in “channel inventory,” the fact that Apple Intelligence hasn’t launched in the region and that after the quarter ended, China issued a national subsidy that would stimulate some Apple product sales.  

“If you look at the negative 11, half of the decline is due to a change in channel inventory, and so the operational performance is better,” Cook said. 

Apple executives usually give some color about how the current quarter is shaping up on a call with analysts. Wall Street is expecting guidance for the March quarter of $1.66 in earnings per share on $95.46 billion in revenue. 

The company reported $36.33 billion in net income during the quarter, up 7.1% from $33.92 billion in the same period last year. 

Apple’s iPad and Mac sales showed strong growth over last year’s struggling sales in the holiday quarter. Mac revenue rose 15% to $8.98 billion and iPad revenue grew 15% to $8.08 billion. 

The company released new Macs during the quarter, including new iMac, Mac Mini and MacBook Pro laptops in October, partially contributing to the growth. Apple also launched a new iPad Mini during the quarter. Cook attributed the growth to the new products.  

“It’s driven by the significant excitement around our latest Mac lineup,” Cook said.  

Apple’s profit engine, its Services division, which includes subscriptions, warranties and licensing deals, reported $23.12 billion in revenue, which is 14% higher than the same period last year. Cook said that the company had over 1 billion subscriptions, which includes both direct subscriptions for services like Apple TV+ and iCloud, as well as subscriptions to third-party apps through the company’s App Store system.  

The company’s “other products” category, also called Wearables, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods, Beats and Vision Pro sales, declined 2% on a year-over-year basis to $11.75 billion in sales. 

Apple said it would pay a dividend of 25 cents per share and spent $30 billion on dividends and share repurchases during the first quarter.

2025-01-30 15:20:34,r/stocks,These are the stocks on my watchlist (01/30),"This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed!

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

**Today OpenAI may make history. Trying out longer form, more detailed catalyst examinations over the short-form with more tickers.**

**Ticker:** [**META (Meta Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $8.02 vs $6.68 expected. Revenue of $48.4B vs $47B,but guided revenue short of consensus and didn't provide FY25 revenue outlook (which triggered the reason for the selloff post-earnings after the close).

Their CAPEX announcement was $60-65B vs $52.4B expected, and stated they expected the single largest driver of expesive growth in 2025 as infrastructure costs due to higher OpEX and depreciation.

Also announced plans to grow META's AI team significantly.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Earnings move the stock on far less volume but the initial selloff after announcement was worth trading- interested in the $700 level today but not much beyond that.

**Context:** Decent earnings but signals that there is more spending on the horizon- likely that the initial brutal selloff to $606 was from algos just reading the initial eye-popping CAPEX number and selling the company.

**Sector Context:**There is a major next-level breakthrough that OpenAI is expected to release today that has agents performing on the same level as PHDs, Altman is meeting today with US government officials. META is the creator of Llama, which is another open source model compared to OpenAI's closed models.

**Risks:** Deepseek has been the main threat involved, with competitors from China using distillation and other AI techniques to be able to train a far cheaper model that brings up the question of why our large tech firms are spending so much on GPUs. (I'm sure this is news to you /s)

**Related Tickers:** FAANG stocks, SNAP, PINS, etc.

Offhand:  Something worth remembering is that there is a $10B undersea cable that spans over 40K km that they plan to build (unknown what the cable is for), more details coming in 2025. Likely some kind of fiber optic cable.

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.73 vs $0.76 expected. Revenue of $25.71B vs $27.23B expected. Most of this revenue miss came from miss in sale of EVs. 

TSLA announced interesting plans to lower the price of EVs in 2025 but also didn't give specific details regarding the production volume targets (as they have in the past), and also announced that there would be a paid robotaxi service in Austin in June. This puts them in competition with Waymo/UBER. Personally I think the vision-only approach is not viable in the long-run but hey, I'm no self-driving PHD. 

CAPEX was ALSO higher as with META due to spending increases from AI training infra costs and battery production capacity.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in the $375/$400 level, not too interested in going long despite the multi-day slide in price.

**Context:** Main reason for TSLA's selloff was the lack of full-year guidance (it gives the subtext that it's too bad to release publically or it's up in the air). Political statements made by Musk may contribute to future issues for TSLA.

**Sector Context:** Revenue shortfall was caused due to lower-than-expected vehicle deliveries/ increased sale incentives, 496K cars vs 507K exp. China's BYD is rapidly catching up, and the (possible) removal of the US EV tax credit may make EV's more expensive

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical- if the tariffs on EV vehicles imported to the US gets removed, TSLA will face fiercer competition from BYD. Also Elon Musk.

**Related Tickers:** BYD (but mainly trades in China, TSLA isn't as impacted by AI news.)



[**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) (in addition to ARM/AMD/SMH/SOXL/semiconductor stocks)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&amp;p=d)

**Catalyst:** The reveal of Deepseek has introduced an AI model that rivals existing solutions but was developed at around $6M. However there's a rumor that Deepseek is actually trained on 50K H100 NVDA gpus.

**Yesterday after the close, there was an announcement Trump officials discussing tightening curbs on Nvidia's China sales.**

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Overall, there's been a massive selloff since NVDA was $150 at the end of last week. Overall interested again if we hit $116, but low confidence we'll sell off again. 

Currently long.

**Sector Context:** Not much to really say about this beyond NVDA having the most advanced chips that are widespread for training because of the CUDA architecture- most people are doubtful that the TOTAL cost was $6M

US Officials are examining export restrictions but China will likely find a way to bypass them as they have previously.

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical, again. Obviously it's very difficult to restrict trade to a country that we have no military presence in or surround, and China is economically far more powerful than those we have attempted trade restrictions on in the past.

2025-01-29 04:21:57,r/stocks,Apple and SpaceX Link Up to Support Starlink Satellite Network on iPhones,"**Thoughts:** Obviously good for companies that are involved in the sat comm business (but may be bad/neutral for sat comm companies that do not work with AAPL such as GSAT), TMUS, and AAPL. TSLA is also possibly affected because SpaceX trades as a proxy to TSLA news. VZ/T/other phone providers may be affected but the use case is so niche that I won't hold my breath. 

&gt;Apple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software, providing an alternative to the company’s in-house satellite-communication service.

&gt;

&gt;The companies have been testing iPhones with the Starlink service from Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an under-the-radar move, the smartphone’s latest software update — released Monday — now supports the technology.

&gt;

&gt;The tie-up comes as a surprise: T-Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones, such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple, meanwhile, already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range.

&gt;

&gt;T-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service, and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test.

&gt;

&gt;The first users received text messages from T-Mobile saying, “You’re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.” Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.

&gt;

&gt;An Apple spokesperson declined to comment, while T-Mobile said that the test will “begin with select optimized smartphones” and that the full launch will “support the vast majority of modern smartphones.” T-Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15, the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

&gt;

&gt;Ever since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022, there’s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple’s 2022 announcement, Musk posted on X that his company has “had some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.”

&gt;

&gt;Here’s how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to enable texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple.

&gt;

&gt;The initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple’s Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.

&gt;

&gt;There’s another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option, meanwhile, is designed to work automatically — even when the phone is in a customer’s pocket.

&gt;

&gt;Both the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off-the-grid areas, such as hiking trails, that don’t have cellular service. The capabilities can’t be used in places where a mobile-phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.

&gt;

&gt;T-Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now, the number of users in the beta is minimal, with T-Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple’s announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes, but it didn’t disclose the Starlink support.

&gt;

&gt;SpaceX requested authority to begin beta-testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T-Mobile’s cellular network in November.

2025-01-28 21:49:53,r/stocks,Bridgewater sees short-term correction for tech stocks but bullish on DeepSeek impact By Reuters,"""Bridgewater sees short-term correction for tech stocks but bullish on DeepSeek impact""

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bridgewater-sees-shortterm-correction-for-tech-stocks-but-bullish-on-deepseek-impact-3834767



  Hedge fund manager Bridgewater Associates said Chinese startup DeepSeek's launch of its latest artificial intelligence (AI) models could lead to a short-term correction in many tech companies' share prices but is positive for the industry.

The comments come amid a tech stocks sell-off prompted by the release of a free AI assistant launched by DeepSeek last week that the startup said uses less data at a fraction of the cost of services currently available.

DeepSeek's AI Assistant has overtaken rival ChatGPT to become the top-rated free application available on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store in the United States, raising doubts about the reasoning behind some U.S. tech companies' decision to pledge billions of dollars in AI investment.

""DeepSeek’s progress is big news, but not bad news for most of the AI ecosystem,"" Bridgewater said in a note on Monday authored by Co-Chief Investment Officer Greg Jensen and Jas Sekhon, chief scientist of AIA Labs, a division within the hedge fund focused on developing and utilizing AI and machine learning technologies to generate investment strategies and insights.

DeepSeek threatens share prices for many tech stocks in the short term, Bridgewater said.

""This may be especially true for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), because DeepSeek’s success may encourage companies to invest more in achieving efficiency gains by optimizing how AI software interacts with the hardware,"" said the note.

Shares in Nvidia, a leader in the AI chip market, fell 17% on Monday, wiping $593 billion from its market value - a record one-day loss for any company - and dragged U.S. stocks lower. That drop was partly corrected on Tuesday, with Nvidia shares up around 5% in premarket trading.

Apologies for the maybe stupid question.

I have started investing about 1 year ago almost all of it (if not all) into well diversified ETFs like SXR8 and SPYY (yes, I know they overlap but I wanted to make it a little bit more USA heavy).

Now, I have really been wanting to invest into stocks and, of course, do the due diligence of learning about it. As I am still on the basics I can't help myself but ask, even long term, is SPY a better bet than, let's say, AAPL?
I understand that sometimes picking the ""good"" stock is difficult, but even 10 years ago Apple was among the companies with the highest market cap and still managed to outperform the index.

So I have 2 stupid questions based on this:
1. In your opinion, might this continue to happen in the future? Not necessarily apple but alphabet, Microsoft, nvidia or Meta are safer bets than Spy?
2. What are your recommendations on where to learn about investing into individual stocks, not say trading but more middle term (I believe it's called swing trading?)

BYPHILIP ELMER-DEWITT

Apple, as hedge fund managers are well aware, is one stock that always bounces back



It’s hard not to be cynical about Wall Street when you see a chart like the one at right, which traces Apple’s (AAPL) share price over the past four weeks.

It not terribly surprising that the stock has shot up nearly 20% in the past two weeks to close at an all-time high Friday of $422. The iPhone 4S is selling briskly and the company is expected to report record earnings on Tuesday.

What’s harder to rationalize is why it fell more than 16% in the two weeks before that to hit an intraday low of $354.24 — the day the iPhone 4S was unveiled and the day before Steve Jobs died.

I’m reminded in times like these of Jason Schwarz’s Apple: Seven Reasons Shorts Love It, first published in 2009. The meat of it can be boiled down to two sentences:

“If you can keep a good stock down then you are able to load up for the ride back up. It’s like a slingshot — the harder you pull, the more propulsion you generate.”

Schwarz, who publishes a popular investment newsletter, is no Zuccotti Park protestor. He’s a Wall Street insider who knows something about how the game is played.

You can read the full text of his thesis here. If you don’t want to click through The Street’s version — posted in seven slow-loading gallery pages — you can read, below the fold, the executive summary we published in 2009. Except for some of the pre-iPad details and the last point, about Steve Jobs, it rings as true today as it did two years ago.

Apple is the market leader. This one stock has become so important to the market that its action is contagious. This influence makes Apple a prized possession for both the longs and the shorts. Knocking down an easier target like Research In Motion or Citigroup doesn’t generate the same snowball effect.
Apple always bounces back. Over the long run, Apple fundamentals will certainly take the stock higher, but hedge funds want to maximize the ride. Keeping a great stock down allows them to profit from quick predetermined trades rather than being fully invested all the time.
The predictability of Apple reduces a short’s risk. Everyone knows when the next iPod, iPhone,and iMac refreshes will hit. This has turned into a calendar-driven catalyst stock. During the quiet time, the stock is vulnerable.
New media have changed the game. Anybody can say anything and the masses will believe it. The topic of Apple currently dominates this new media. There is no accountability or verification of sources like the old days. In such an environment, hidden agendas can be pushed endlessly without disclosure.
Apple secrecy. As the unparalleled leader in tech innovation, Apple feels that it is necessary to keep future products veiled to all competitors, consumers and investors … Apple has yet to sell a single Tablet, yet hedge funds already have made millions from rumors surrounding the product. The lack of transparency from Apple creates a perfect storm for short-term traders.
Apple innovation. This company is so good that it causes imaginations to run wild. A hedge fund could float a story that Apple is thinking of buying Saturn in order to develop a new brand of Apple cars and people would go nuts … The constant innovation coming out of Apple provides traders with endless material for believable speculation.
Steve Jobs is the visionary of the century. This one man is the single greatest asset in corporate America, which causes Apple stock to trade with a Steve Jobs premium, a variable that the shorts can use as well. Apple’s stock is always vulnerable to losing Jobs.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

They underperformed the S&amp;P500 (before their fee), and almost all positions are just S&amp;P500 companies anyways, so I figured if I went 100% into an S&amp;P index on my own I can't do worse.

I'm not sure how best to proceed with the current number of individual stocks. There are 64 positions total and it's unrealistic that I'll be able to keep track of the performance/trajectory of that many companies. Buffet's ""pick a few winners"" comes to mind. I've been assuming the best thing to do is to slowly liquidate the one's I don't have a specific interest in, and buy VOO/SPY in their place.

There are many companies that I like and would like to hold on to (AAPL, AMD, AMZN, BRKB, GOOGL, JNJ, KO, MSFT, NVDA, NFLX, PG). However, the majority are S&amp;P 500 companies that I don't follow closely (ABT, ADBE, AMAT, AMGN, AMT, AVGO, AZN, BA, BMY, CAT, COP, CRM, CVX, ... to name a few). It's not that I don't know those companies, but it feels ignorant to hold onto them knowing that I won't have time to monitor their performance.

Is there a best way to go about liquidating those and moving into an S&amp;P 500 index? Initial temptation is gambler's fallacy (sell the low performers first and keep the better ones a bit longer).",7,4,JohKneeBee,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i8mzb1/switched_from_ameriprise_managed_account_to/,1i8mzb1
2025-01-23 21:44:43,r/stocks,Reddit ETF progress from Jan 2021 to Jan 2025,"This [Reddit ETF post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ku6skz/reddit_etf/) was made at the beginning of 2021, near the period of peak euphoria.  Anyone who was around at the time can testify that this really did represent consensus opinions in this sub at that time, which you can see in the comments of that post.  Note that the game store madness did not really begin until a couple weeks later, which is why it did not appear there.

I felt like it was going to play out poorly so I bookmarked it, and now have been doing yearly updates.  After all, for something like this, you really need to give it a multiple year timeline at least.

We are now on year 4, and to date I have sarcastically remarked about how the sharp, financial geniuses of the time performed against SPY and VTI.  This year I was rather surprised at the results.  All 2025 numbers use the prices right now.

*I used a $100,000 initial investment and just rounded all the prices to the dollar for visual simplicity (all entries use the real, full prices, I have just rounded them for this table).  This also backtracks prices from stock splits.*

Still, up 40% in 4 years is pretty good!  Let's see how much you beat the market by.

Oh.   Though I must admit that I was caught off guard by the comeback it is mounting.  Reddit ETF went up 69% in 2024 and is closing in on VTI.

Quick question, I was believing apple had one of the biggest cash hoards in corporate america, $100b+. I was looking tr the financial statements and this is not the case. I remember I read about apple not  putting its cash reserves (overseas) on the reports, since cash is stashed overseas.

Please would anyone give me some insight?

 BUT what i am asking is if NVDA/TSLA/LLY/Planatir/etc. have big earnings,miss, can the stock price shake it off and continue an incredible bullish run.. Or is,that generally the end of the extraordinary stock run?

In recnt times, it seems like the 4 stocks i mentioned had really amazing runs (very little precedence i'd say,for,such huge runs over,a medium length period, and eapecially for mega-caps)..  w​as there very little bad news,associated with them? Or,did investors create their bubble-like returns to some degree absent specific good news much of the time (i mean absence,of bi-weekly specific good news)

Something I've wondered for awhile.. Surprisingly i have not seen a research paper on this subject?

Right i am wondering this,about Tesla in particular.. NVDA and LLY have slowed alot.. And Planitir not a key stock

I do know AAPL didn't have a meaningful earnings miss for a long time.. 10 years or so

Thanks in adance.. I am very interested in stock theory, backteating and research papers (academic or practitioner)

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-01-17 09:22:46,r/AAPL,💎👋🏼 here,"💎👋🏼 here. I won‘t sell a single share. Apple ist at the verge of bringing AI and AI Agents to 1bn+ people. The next big catalysts in the near term are:

•	⁠AI integration &amp; some kind of Siri+ (5-10$/month or even more)

•	⁠SatCom &amp; some kind of „Apple Connect +“

•	⁠Apple kept expectations low in the last 5 years regarding new iPhone features and design: This year they will bring a redesigned iPhone and everybody will upgrade

•	⁠iPhone SE4 - redesign - cheap price - AI capable: perfect for the masses and countrys that aren‘t that developed yet

- of course Apples big stock buybacks!

Further out in the future:

•	⁠Apple Watch with Blood Pressure &amp; Glucose monitoring (huge gamechanger for millions of people)

•	⁠AirPods with cameras integrated &amp; AI capabilty as a hearing aid and as a translator (your opponent speaks in a different language, AirPods will „hear“ it and „see“ what he‘s saying and translating it simultaneously for you)

•	⁠Apple Vision: when Apple makes it more affordable a lot people will jump on that train. I don‘t know what we can expect, but I‘m confident that the smartest manager and engineers in the world will know

•	⁠new products like „HomePad“ and stuff we can‘t even imagine yet.

2025-01-16 23:54:35,r/AAPL,AAPL  Retire Us ,"AAPL Calls - Time to Fucking YOLO! 🚀🚀🚀**

Listen up, you bunch of degenerates,

I've been staring at this AAPL chart like it's the only thing that can save me from my shitty life, and here's why you need to load up on some calls before this bitch takes off:

**Current Price**: $228.23 - AAPL's practically giving us a fucking discount here. When was the last time you saw a deal this good, you cheap bastards?

**RSI(14)**: 29.92 - This RSI is so fucking low it's like it's on its knees begging for a bull to come save it. We're in oversold territory, and that's our fucking signal to buy.

**MACD**: -0.89 vs Signal -1.00 - The MACD is about to cross like a couple of horny teenagers at prom. When this shit happens, it's time to go all in. Bullish crossover incoming, and we're talking about a fucking rocket launch.

**Moving Averages**: We're below the MA(10) at $228.42, MA(50) at $231.43, and way the fuck below the MA(200) at $236.49. This is like the stock market version of a rubber band about to snap your fucking face off when it rebounds.

**Bollinger Bands**: We're tickling the lower band at $227.72. This is like playing with fire, but we're not here to be safe, we're here to make fucking money. It's support level time, and we're about to bounce off it like a fucking trampoline.

**VWAP**: At $230.07, we're below this bitch, which means we're underfuckingvalued. Time to buy like we're at a fucking clearance sale.

**The Play**: Here we go, you beautiful bastards - **Buy the $230 Call Option expiring on February 21, 2025**. Why this? Because we're giving AAPL enough time to realize it's fucking mistake and climb back up. We're betting on a nice recovery, and we're not here to pussyfoot around.

**Why Calls?**: Because we're not fucking pussies. Calls are for the bold, the ones who want to ride the wave all the way to the fucking moon. We're not here for safety; we're here to fucking win.

**Risk**: Sure, there's always risk, but who gives a fuck? ",51,13,Immediate_Machine_46,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/1i31t5v/aapl_retire_us/,1i31t5v

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Broadcom has a decrease in operating income for 2024 compared to TTM. This appears to be attributable to increased operating expenses, likely due to its acquisition of VMWare last year, although I'd appreciate if someone with more experience can confirm this.

I kinda got this idea in my head that AAPL is a company without much growth left and have been thinking about lightening up my position on it.

So I decided to make some graphs to figure out what to think and because pictures easy raw data hard. 

First off I was curious what apple's shares outstanding looked like. I know their buy back program is massive and I also know they're not growing top line revenue but are spending a ton on buybacks so this was a good place to start. Considering the share price has also been going up a lot and their market cap is massive so I thought buybacks might have a negligible effect. Wow was I wrong. The shares outstanding are down like 36% in ten years! I couldn't ask for a better looking chart. At this rate it'll all be bought back in like 18.9 more years.

Then I was obviously curious about the EPS and decided to graph that. I was less surprised about how this turned out but it did still offer some insights. I hadn't seen before that they had multiple recent periods of EPS decline that they managed to turn around in big ways. And their EPS since covid is surprisingly down less than I thought so that's not so bad.

It doesn't change my opinion that their product lines are basically stagnant and not exactly innovative on a level that would spur a ton of growth, who tf needs another slimmer iPhone, iPad etc and I think that's a pretty widely held belief given the charts.

However, it's pretty crazy to see that they've bought back a 3rd of their shares in the past 9 years. Also pretty wild to see how its EPS has grown despite not a lot of innovation.

Lastly I was curious how their wearables revenue was doing because I heard recently about the FDA approving AirPods to be hearing devices which is probably a huge market? IDK but what I do know is hearing aids are stupid expensive compared to $200 air pods so this could be big. So far it looks like wearables is doing about $9B a quarter so if growth in that picked up it could be meaningful

All in all I think I keep my position the same, especially considering most of it is through SPYG which has AAPL and NVDA nearly the same weights which kinda strikes me as a yin and yang sorta situation.

Meanwhile,  besides OpenAI, Google every other day is improvindg their Gemini, Microsoft has firmly planted its foot in the door with its heavy involvement in OpenAI. Third parties like Meta and Elon Musk have already into the LLM market as competitors. All in all, most released systems are already at the 2nd or 3rd generation, at least.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-12-06 09:48:09,r/stocks,How Long Will You Keep DCA?,"Let's say you are doing DCA for stocks you have high convictions, such as NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, PLTR or RKLB.

And you are doing, say $200 per month or perhaps $500 every quarter (more or less, depending on your financial situations) per stock.

1) At what stage of the stock's life would you then decide to stop DCA? Especially for stocks like MSFT and AAPL that have been around for a long while?

2) Also, while you DCA, would you also sell your initial amount you bought? Or you'd let it ride?

3) What stocks are you guys DCA now?

Thank you folks! 🚀

TSMC is already making preparations to start production early next year, the sources said.

Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which the company unveiled in March, have so far been manufactured at TSMC's facilities in Taiwan. The company has seen high demand from customers involved in generative AI and accelerated computing for the chips, which it says is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots.

The agreement, if finalised, would secure another customer for TSMC's Arizona facility, which is scheduled to start volume production next year.

TSMC and Nvidia declined to comment. The sources did not want to be identified as the talks were confidential.

Two of the sources said Apple (AAPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are current customers at the Arizona plant. Apple and AMD did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

However, while TSMC plans to produce the front-end process of Nvidia's Blackwell chips in Arizona, the chips will still need to be shipped back to Taiwan for packaging. The Arizona facility does not have chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) capacity that is essential to the Blackwell chips, two of the sources said.

All of TSMC's CoWoS capacity is currently in Taiwan.

Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is investing tens of billions of dollars in building three facilities in Phoenix and the project has won significant subsidies from the U.S. government which wants to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States.

According to my analysis of Apple’s recent stock performance, I think the stock is going to go down in the next 10 days. The Bollinger Band is widening, which means the market is extremely volatile, price has broken above the top Band and that stock may be over bought. Further, the price is also much higher than the 20 day Exponential Moving Average (EMA 20), which usually precedes a mean reversion or a price correction. The MACD line is clearly above the signal line indicating strong bullish momentum, however, this huge separation can be the precursor to a reversal as other indicators show overextension. Along with a low number of trades being conducted, the price surge does not support these recent levels, implying a lack of strong buying interest pushing the price to the levels it is now. This collection of technical indicators tells us collectively that in the not too distant future the stock performance of Apple may see a pullback or correction.

2024-11-26 18:42:54,r/AAPL,Apple’s New Moves and Updates On $490M Investor Settlement,"Hey everyone, if you missed it, they seem to be diving into something straight out of a Steve Jobs dream—developing smart home devices (like a TV or similar) powered by its new Apple Intelligence. It’s still early days, but this could be a real development next year.



About the settlement over Tim Cook’s 2018 comments on China’s sales— you might already know about it, but there’s been an update, so here’s a quick recap for anyone who missed it.   
  


Back in 2018, Cook mentioned during an earnings call that while Apple faced sales issues in countries with high inflation (like Brazil and Russia), there were “no issues in China.” But just days later, Apple cut production orders from suppliers, so I think it was obviously otherwise.



And just two months later, Apple shocked everyone with its first announcement about the revenue cut since the iPhone establishment in 2007, causing AAPL to drop by 10% and resulting in 70B losses.



This led to multiple lawsuits accusing Apple of misleading investors. While Apple has consistently denied any wrongdoing, the company recently agreed to a $490M settlement, even before a court hearing.



But here’s the update, I just found out that even though the deadline already passed, they are taking late claims on this. So if you were hit by this, you can check it out and [file for it](https://11thestate.com/cases/apple-investor-settlement).  
  


However, do you think it’s a good idea to start developing new products like this? And does that half a billion even come close to covering the $70 billion loss?

2024-11-02 19:20:38,r/stocks,Globalstar and Apple expanded partnership ,"Does anyone have anymore information on Globalstar GSAT and Apple AAPL expanded partnership? Is GSAT a buy after the 40% rise in share price?.

Here is some information I have , but is there anything I should be aware of ? 

The expanded partnership between Globalstar (GSAT) and Apple (APL) could bring significant long-  term benefits to Globalstar's stock, though some challenges may stil lie ahead.  
Potential Positive Impacts  I. Revenue Growth: With Apple prepaying up to $1.1 billion and committing to pay additional  service fees, Globalstar can expect substantial revenue growth. The agreement is projected to  more than double Globalstar's annual revenue compared to 2024 levels, primarily driven by the  new satellite network's capacity and performance milestones  2. Market Confidence: Apple's involvement and the substantial upfront payments provide market  validation for Globalstar, boosting investor confidence. A stronger association with Apple, along  with its 20% equity stake in Globalstar's satellite network, reinforces the viability and demand for  satellite-enabled connectivity, especially in remote and underserved areas
3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  C  industries (e.g., maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple cOwews  
Potential Risks  
1. High Dependency on Apple: The partners. p heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to zero.
3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  industries (e.g. maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple.
Potential Risks  
1. High Dependency on Apple: The partnership heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to  Apple's needs and future directions. If Apple shifts its strategic focus away from satellite  communication, Globalstar's revenue and stock could be negatively affected,  
2. Execution Risks: Globalstar must deliver the new MSS network according to Apple's  performance milestones. Failing to meet these milestones could result in reduced or delayed  payments, which would likely impact the stock negatively.
In the near term, Globalstar's stock may experience heightened volatility, as its year-to-date  performance has already been variable. However, if Globalstar manages this partnership successfully.  it could see sustained growth, especially as satelite connectivity becomes increasingly relevant to  tech giants like Apple.

2024-11-02 13:19:31,r/stocks,Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway sold ~$14 billion worth of Apple this quarter. Cash pile hits record ~$325 billion.,"Berkshires cash on hand hits a record $325 Billion

Currently owns ~$69.9 Billion worth of Apple $AAPL as of the end of Q3 down from $84.2B worth as of the end of Q2

No brk.a or brk.b shares repurchase in Q3

Posts Q3 revenue of $92.9B compared to $93.2B YoY

Operating earnings fell 6% from a year earlier to $10.09 billion as insurance underwriting earnings slumped

#

&gt;**It is being widely reported that Berkshire's operating earnings declined 6.2% in the quarter. No. The reported figures include unrealized currency losses in 2024 and gains in 2023 on BRK's debt denominated in foreign currencies, largely yen. Earnings really grew 8.5% in Q3 to $11.2 billion against $10.3 billion and were up 18.0% for the nine months to $33.0 billion from $28.0 billion. Just as short-term movements in equity prices can distort the reporting of operating profits, so to do currency swings on debt outstanding. Both should be excluded from an analysis of operating and economic profit.**

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

AAPL -- I continue to see them innovate, they won't stick with something that isn't working, and their stuff just works.

Here’s why: Right now, AI might feel limited to things like ChatGPT, but its potential goes far beyond that. Over the next 3, 5, or 10 years, AI is going to transform industries in ways we can’t fully imagine yet. We’re talking about healthcare revolutionizing how we diagnose and treat patients, transportation with autonomous vehicles and drones making logistics smarter and more efficient, and manufacturing, where AI will optimize production processes and supply chains.

Now, I know what you're thinking: 'What, you think the world is full of cave dwellers? Who doesn't know that?' and you're right. Everyone knows AI techonology will be advanced and utilized in so many ways in the near future.

But look, you can think of it like real estate. Sure, property values rise while new highways or shopping centers are being built, but the real surge in value happens once people start using them and see the full benefits. Right now, AI is still in its “under construction” phase—people can imagine the future potential, but the true value hasn’t been fully realized yet. The market has priced in expectations, sure, but once AI is fully integrated across industries and we start seeing its widespread, real-world impact, I believe we’ll see another major surge in stock prices. What’s priced in now is just the beginning—the real growth will come as AI starts transforming daily life and business on a much larger scale.

Before ChatGPT went mainstream, people assumed ‘just’ that level of AI technology would arrive soon enough, but they didn’t think it would have this much of an impact on stock prices once it came to life for the public. Everyone knew advanced AI was on the horizon, but the market didn’t price it like they do now. This shows just how much underestimation happens until we truly start experiencing the technology firsthand. And that’s why, despite what’s already been priced in, I think AI stocks are still undervalued given the game-changing growth ahead. Anyone else rethinking their portfolio with AI at the center?",0,0,Nobuevrday,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g6k31k/i_flipped_my_entire_portfolio_of_etfs_for_ai/,1g6k31k

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

TSM — which produces chips for some of the world's largest tech companies including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) — saw September-quarter revenue of NT$759.69B (adding revenues for July NT$256.95B, August NT$250.87B and September NT$251.87B) (about $23.6B).

The average analyst forecast is NT$748B, according to a report by Bloomberg News.

While announcing its second quarter results in July, TSM said it expected third quarter revenue to be between $22.4B and $23.2B (midpoint of $22.8B). For the third quarter, the company expected its business to be helped by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for its leading-edge process technologies.

2024-10-01 21:15:40,r/stocks,Challenge to find stocks matching 13 attributes of Peter Lynch,"I tried to find modern examples to each attribute mentioned in Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street. Then I thought this community could find better fits and have fun together. So please share you candidates for any category below - maybe we discover hidden gems along the way.

RECAP: Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street is  filled with fundamental yet profound strategies.  Invest in simple, easy-to-understand businesses over complex ones.  Identify undervalued companies with stable returns and less competition. And, search for as many of 13 attributes of the hypothetically ""perfect company."" The dream attributes of such a company go as:

***It Sounds Dull—Or Even Better Ridiculous:***

Companies with unexciting or absurd names often go unnoticed and can be undervalued, providing excellent buying opportunities. Lynch highlights that these companies are typically engaged in simple, straightforward businesses and the duller the name, the better the prospects could be.

My examples: Duckhorn Portfolio (NAPA) &amp; The Lovesac Company (LOVE)

***It Does Something Dull:***

Companies engaged in mundane or straightforward businesses might not attract attention but often provide stable and increasing returns. Lynch appreciates companies that do boring things as they are less likely to be in the limelight and more likely to be undervalued.

My examples: Waste Management (WM) &amp; Stepan Company (SCL)

***It Does Something Disagreeable:***

Businesses involved in unpleasant industries (like waste management) are often overlooked. Their disagreeable nature keeps them under the radar of most investors, potentially leading to lower valuations and higher returns for those willing to invest in them.

My Examples: Altria Group (MO), cannabis companies and Caesars Entertainment (CZR)

***It’s a Spinoff:***

Corporate spinoffs often result in profitable investment opportunities. Parent companies usually ensure that spinoffs have strong balance sheets and are well-positioned for success, leading to lucrative investments.

Found a good website on this: [https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/](https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/)

***The Institutions Don’t Own It, and The Analysts Don’t Follow It:***

Stocks with little to no institutional ownership and minimal analyst coverage can indicate untapped potential. These ""ignored"" stocks might offer significant opportunities for gains before they become mainstream.

My examples: Denny's Corporation (DENN) &amp; Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR)

***The Rumors Abound: It’s Involved with Toxic Waste and/or the Mafia:***

Lynch points out that companies involved in industries surrounded by rumors or negative perceptions, like waste management or alleged Mafia connections, can offer hidden value. The negative stigma leads to fewer investors and potentially lower valuations.

My examples: **Clean Harbors (CLH)** &amp; Boyd Gaming (BYD)

***There’s Something Depressing About It:***

Companies operating in industries that deal with the less pleasant aspects of life, like funeral services, often have consistent demand and face little competition. They are typically ignored by the larger investing community, providing opportunities for higher returns.

My examples: Service Corporation International (SCI) &amp; Matthews International Corporation (MATW)

***It’s a No-Growth Industry:***

Contrary to popular belief, Lynch prefers investing in low or no-growth industries as they tend to have less competition and more predictable business. The stability and predictability of such industries can lead to steady returns.

My examples: Consolidated Edison (ED) &amp; American Water Works (AWK)

***It’s Got a Niche:***

A strong niche market provides a company with a competitive edge and often a virtual monopoly in its area. Niche companies can control pricing and enjoy high barriers to entry for competitors, often leading to sustained profits

My examples: Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) &amp; WD-40 Company (WDFC)

***People Have to Keep Buying It:***

Lynch prefers investing in companies that make essential, habitual or addictive products like drugs, soft drinks, or cigarettes over those making fickle products, as continuous buying ensures steady business.

My examples: Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) &amp; Reckitt Benckiser (RBGLY)

***It's a User of Technology:***

Companies that effectively utilize technology to reduce costs or enhance services are appealing. For example, a company benefiting from the technological price war, like Automatic Data Processing using cheaper computers to increase its profitability, is a better bet than the companies making the computers.

My examples: Walmart (WMT) &amp; Domino’s Pizza (DPZ)

***The Insiders are Buyers:***

Insider buying is a strong positive signal. If the people who know the company best are buying its stock, it's a good indication of confidence in the company's future. Lynch values insider buying as a sign that the company won't go bankrupt soon and that management is aligned with shareholders' interests.

My examples: Zoom Video Communications (ZM) &amp; Carnival Corporation (CCL)

***The Company is Buying Back Shares:***

Companies that buy back their own shares reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases the value of the remaining shares. This action typically indicates the company believes its shares are undervalued and is a way to reward investors. Lynch sees share buybacks as a very positive move, often more beneficial than other use of capital like dividends or acquisitions​.

2024-10-01 17:23:05,r/stocks,The Crash of the stock market has arrived. Price/Earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire S&amp;P 500. ,"Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. 

The ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.

According to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&amp;P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.

Below is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&amp;P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..

While the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.

Historically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&amp;P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.

Currently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.

In the history of the S&amp;P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...

* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).
* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).
* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).

Images aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07

Historically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.

* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&amp;P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.
* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&amp;P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.
* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).

**Okay -- so** ***Maybe*** **we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**

Outside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.

* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.
* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.
* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.
* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.
* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.
* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.
* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.
* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).
* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.
* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.
* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.
* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.
* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.
* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.
* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.

I believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.

**This economic downturn may be severe.**

In the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.

**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**

People have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.

This will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.

**What happens from here?**

I don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I'm probably wrong about 100% of this.

The prediction in bold below is what I posted 90 days ago. I now believe the top is officially in -- that we won't see another ATH for a long time. 

**My Prediction? GSPC/SPY cruise up a tiny bit further, to +/- $5900/$590 -- before retreating to $3500/$350 by 12/2025.**

Even when it was trading at ATH's it had a price/FCF of 4.5 which to me still seems like a screaming buy.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

For those who may not remember, back in 2018, Tim Cook said that though Apple had sales problems in a few countries with high inflation rates like Brazil and Russia, there were no such problems for China. But then, just a few days later, Apple cut production and requested it from the suppliers, so I think it was obviously otherwise.



And, just two months later, Apple shocked everyone with its first announcement about the revenue cut since the iPhone establishment in 2007, causing AAPL to drop by 10% and resulting in 70B losses. This led to several lawsuits based on Cook's comments, but Apple denied that they had any wrongdoing in this case (and they continue to deny it to this day).



So, at this point, this whole story is going to an end because recently, Apple decided to pay $490M to investors due to the situation, even before the court hearing. And the deadline is in two weeks, so if you were one of those damaged investors, you should definitely [check it out](https://11thestate.com/cases/apple-investor-settlement).



In other Apple news, they just launched iOS 18 and other new updates — bringing key changes to how the company’s devices operate and setting the stage for generative AI features. So apart from the new pink iPhone, we may see some new things from them soon.



Anyways, what do you think? Does that half a billion even come close to covering the $70 billion loss? And did you already regret about your ios updates?

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed Monday morning as investors await the Federal Reserve’s highly anticipated policy meeting, during which central bankers are expected to cut rates for the first time since 2020.
*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures slipped less than 0.4%, while futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 104 points, or 0.2%. Meanwhile, Nasdaq-100 futures pulled back 0.3%.
*****
&gt; Apple shares fell more than 2% in early trading after analysts at firms, including Bank of America and JPMorgan, noted that shipping times could point to lighter demand for iPhone 16 Pro models than the prior year.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is less than 1% away from its July record and could notch a new all-time high this week. After a rough start to a historically weak September, the three major U.S. indexes ended last week’s trading session in the green, with the S&amp;P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite just closing their best week of 2024.
*****
&gt; The Fed is set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday and are widely anticipated to make their first interest rate cut since they began hiking rates in March 2022. A cut this week would be a pivotal move, as many investors hope the decision could lower borrowing costs for companies and improve overall earnings growth — boosting economic growth.
*****
&gt; The overnight lending rate is currently at 5.25% to 5.5%. Traders are split on whether the central bank will cut rates by 25 or 50 basis points, per the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
*****
&gt; Stocks typically post strong gains during cycles where initial rate cuts are able to sustain economic expansion, BMO Capital chief investment strategist Brian Belski said.
*****
&gt; “So long as nothing breaks in the economy, U.S. stocks remain firmly within a bull market, but with significantly strong trailing one-year performance headed into this initial rate cut, future gains are likely to be more muted relative to historical norms, in our view,” he said in a Friday note ahead.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

# [Stock futures are flat as September sluggishness continues, traders await inflation data: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were mostly flat Tuesday after the major averages rebounded from their worst week in 2024.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures each added about 0.1%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 16 points, or less than 0.1%.
*****
&gt; Cloud platform company Oracle surged about 8% after posting fiscal first-quarter results that topped expectations. Oracle also announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services to provide database services.
*****
&gt; On Monday, the three major averages made a sharp comeback after posting their worst week this year as investors bought the dip. The S&amp;P 500 popped 1.16% to snap a four-day run of losses and post its first winning day in September. The Nasdaq Composite also closed 1.16% higher, aided by a jump in Nvidia. The Dow climbed 484 points, or 1.2%.
*****
&gt; These moves come as investors bet that a widely anticipated interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve’s Sept. 17-18 meeting could help assuage concerns over a weakening economy. August’s payrolls report, which came out last Friday, reflected growth of 142,000, below economists’ expectations. The results helped fuel a sell-off that day.
*****
&gt; Traders have their eyes on two key economic reports that will likely be the next catalysts for stocks. The consumer price index report for August is due out Wednesday, followed by the producer price index on Thursday.
*****
&gt; September is historically a weak month for equities. Investors remain cautious about seasonality’s effect on stock performance as well as uncertainty around the approaching U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5.
*****
&gt; “We concur with the view that the market is likely to remain choppy at least until the election,” Bank of America equity and quantitative strategist Ohsung Kwon wrote Monday. “Macro data have been weakening, especially in manufacturing/goods, which represent 50% of earnings for the S&amp;P 500.”

2024-09-08 23:02:32,r/stocks,The AAPL Monday Morning arbitrage trade (codename 7senshino's arbitrage),"Update:  a user reminded me it's not an arbitrage, I agree with him. However I'm not able to update the post title, so I'm putting this update on the front here 

I'm sharing this old idea I had more than a decade ago. I bought AAPL around 2012. Then for several years, I would look daily at it's stock price. One day i noticed that if I bought AAPL at 9am ET on Monday morning then sell at 9.30am ET, I could possibly make a profit, at least on days where the market would not be doom and gloomy.
Doing it daily and compounding the profits, I'd end up possibly rich, at least based on a quick calculation I did in either 2014 or 2015  with a subset of data ranging forabout a quarter length...

That's it, easy right, little risk, hence a possible arbitrage:
Buy AAPL at 9 on Monday, sell it at 9.30.

But I never executed the idea as I didn't want to get into the active trading thing.
Fast forward now in 2024, I'm wondering if it  was a great idea?
I don't have access to my Bloomberg anymore and don't have time to run numbers. Maybe it's an old well known idea among traders and I'm not the first one who thought about it. 
Maybe it's still a valid trade, maybe there are other stocks who would enjoy the Monday morning effect or kick.
I have no idea.
But I wanted to share it here to all the experts to get some insights.
Feel free to use it if you can make a buck out of it. If you become rich and reach the moon, don't forget me :).
Cheers.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed Tuesday after a slide in technology names pressured the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 futures climbed both slipped under 0.1%. Nasdaq-100 futures fell marginalluy.
*****
&gt; On Monday, the Dow broke with the broader market and reached intraday and closing record highs. Meanwhile, a decline in tech stocks and a gain in less favored segments like energy signaled that investors might be rotating out of one of the market’s key drivers over the past year.
*****
&gt; Investors are eager to see earnings from top artificial intelligence beneficiary Nvidia on Wednesday. Shares of the semiconductor firm closed more than 2% lower Monday and were marginally higher in after hours trading. Nvidia has become a key bellwether for tech stocks and AI more broadly, and investors will look toward its second-quarter results to gauge the health of the AI trade.
*****
&gt; Stocks are trying to find stable footing after a brutal start to the month. Investors have grown more optimistic, however, after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled on Friday that the central bank’s next move will be to cut benchmark interest rates. Powell did not specify when, or by how much, interest rates would be reduced.
*****
&gt; Traders are unanimously forecasting a rate cut at the central bank’s Sept.17-18 policy meeting of at least 25 basis points, according to data from the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool.
*****
&gt; “It’s going to take time for the cuts to go all over the economy ... the market is doing some of the heavy lifting for the Fed, but there’s a lot of question marks,” Allianz chief economic advisor Mohamed El-Erian told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Monday.
*****
&gt; Investors will also parse fresh quarterly earnings from retailer Nordstrom after the closing bell Tuesday for insight into the health of consumers.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-08-14 14:14:48,r/stocks,GOOG - Bull Case - Custom TPU leading to successful AI products,"I've been experimenting text based GPT from OpenAI's ChatGPT to Google Bard to now Gemini AI.

Since late '22 when the world was caught in attention on the magic of ChatGPT, people have been flocking to buy the next best accelerator cards (Nvidia), hoping they can be the next one to come out with the killer app - that ambitious goal to reach AGI first.

It's only up until very recently that I was made known that Gemini AI is entirely trained on Google custom TPU. I read a little about it (I found that TPU discussion is very little over here) and found that in the earlier days since Alexnet deep learning approach back to 2012.

Previous generalized computing (thank you Intel Xeon) tries to cope with big data workload. Accelerators were found to be particularly efficient in those machine learning workload. Early exploration by Google on designing custom TPU for themselves so they can have more flexibility catering to specific workloads. This decision alone turns out to be very valuable in today's Gen AI era.

With recent news from Apple that they have been training their AI models with Google's TPU, also the performance of Gemini AI to be on par with industry leading ChatGPT (heard that Antropic's Sonnet is even better - but Gemini is really good enough for my daily use).

These observations make strong statements to the Gen AI community, i.e.,  you can bypass Nvidia and still perform adequately well (even supercede for some reports) in your AI product offering.

The fact that Google does not hoard all its computing power to its own Gemini training, and the ability to extend its compute to customers like AAPL speak volume on the native TPU effectiveness.

Cost and time wise, Google is the prime candidate in AI era as TPU helps smoothen out the training cost. With ads revenue fueling the AI training (heard that OpenAI now needs more money), and superior TPU working natively, I'm of the opinion that Google will create a lot of value many years from now.",87,36,alex_godspeed,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1es01n4/goog_bull_case_custom_tpu_leading_to_successful/,1es01n4

Guys, after selling a few million shares two months ago, Berkshire now unloaded 50% more. It’s still no reason to run especially when AAPL reported another phenomenal quarter.

All Berkshire is doing is capitalizing on the gains and rotating money to short term treasuries as this economy unfolds. To add  INTC had a terrible quarter and will lay off 17.5k workers or 15% of the workforce. This is just the beginning of more layoff’s to come in various industries thanks to our friends at the treasury, or knuckleheads.

Remember it never hurts to unwind some gains.

2024-08-01 22:33:42,r/stocks,"Apple sales rise 5%, topping estimates as iPad and Services revenue jump","Apple reported fiscal third-quarter earnings on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations, with overall revenue rising 5%.  

Here’s how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ended June 29: 

EPS: $1.40 vs. $1.35 estimated
 
Revenue: $85.78 billion vs. $84.53 billion estimated 

iPhone revenue: $39.30 billion vs. $38.81 billion estimated 

Mac revenue: $7.01 billion vs. $7.02 billion estimated 

iPad revenue: $7.16 billion vs. $6.61 billion estimated 

Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue: $8.10 billion vs. $7.79 billion estimated 

Services revenue: $24.21 billion vs. $24.01 billion estimated 

Gross margin: 46.3% vs. 46.1% estimated 

Apple did not provide formal guidance, although CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri often share information about the current quarter on a call with analysts.  

Apple reported $21.44 billion in net income during the quarter, versus $19.88 billion in the year-ago period.  

Apple’s most important business remains the iPhone, which accounted for about 46% of the company’s total sales during the quarter. While Apple beat LSEG estimates, the product line still declined about 1% on an annual basis to $39.29 billion in revenue.  

“On a constant currency basis, we grew year on year. And so that’s sort of how we look at it from an operational point of view,” Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach.  

Cook said that while Apple doesn’t know about the positive sales impact from its newly announced Apple Intelligence service until it starts shipping to customers later this fall, he said that Apple had been increasing spending to get the service ready.  

“What we’ve done is we’ve redeployed a lot of people on to AI that were working on other things,” Cook said. “From a data center point of view, as you know, we have a hybrid approach. So we both have our own and we partner with people. And so that capex would be in the partners’ financials, and we would be paying expense.” 

“Certainly embedded in our results this quarter is an increase year over year in the amount we’re spending for AI and Apple intelligence,” Cook continued.  

Apple showed strongest growth in its iPad division, which grew nearly 24% year-over-year to $7.16 billion in sales. Apple released new iPads during the quarter for the first time since 2022, which spurred a wave of upgrades. 

Cook said that about half of iPad buyers haven’t owned one before, suggesting the tablet market is not yet saturated. 

Apple’s Mac division reported $7 billion in sales, up about 2% from the year-ago quarter.  

Apple Watch sales, headphones such as Beats or AirPods, and HomePod home speakers are reported under “Wearables, Home, and Accessories.” Sales in the catch-all category declined 2% to $8.10 billion during the quarter.  

“A whopping two thirds of the Apple Watch buyers were new to the product. So, we’re still growing that base significantly,” Cook said.  

The Services business is most important growth category for Apple and includes hardware warranties, revenue from Google, monthly cloud storage subscriptions, and the company’s content subscriptions, such as Apple TV+. The company reported $24.21 billion in Services sales, up 14% and in-line with Apple’s forecast and LSEG estimates. 

Apple said in a statement that it had more active devices in each of its regions than it ever had before, without providing a specific number. Apple’s active device count is important because it signifies a group of existing Apple customers to which it can sell its profitable services. Apple said in February that it had 2.2 billion active devices.  

Apple said it had 1 billion paid subscriptions, which includes subscriptions to iPhone apps through Apple’s App Store.  

However, Apple sales declined 6% to $14.72 billion in greater China, a region that also includes Taiwan and Hong Kong. Apple is under pressure in mainland China as local rivals such as Huawei introduce competing products.  

“Mainland China and Greater China actually had a record in the iPhone install base,” Cook said. “Kantar tells us we had the top three selling smartphones in urban China and the results in China represent an acceleration from the first half of the year.” 

Apple said it spent $32 billion on dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.

2024-08-01 20:13:46,r/stocks,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&amp;P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&amp;P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&amp;P 500 over the next 24 months.

2024-07-31 20:30:01,r/AAPL,Apple Intelligence Waitlist,"So, I'm a developer and pretty big Apple shareholder. 

I have a new iPad with the m4 chip and just installed iOS 18.1 (beta). 

So this is the first version of iOS that has some Apple Intelligence features. 

Once you install the update you get prompted to join a waitlist to get access to Apple intelligence. I will report back with my initial experiences once I get of the waitlist. 

Takeaways so far on what they are actually including based on the onboarding UI

- Apple Intelligence is available in English only

- Siri has heightened context and can carry on conversations similar to other LLMs like ChatGPT. Interested to see if it's any good, and what the latency is like. 

- The creative features seem to be there a bit, with the enhanced writing and some of the image generation stuff. 

Either way, I'm not sure how many people even have access to this since it's on a waitlist, but I imagine that initially a lot of the perceived success will depend on the Siri features, since it will take time for the software ecosystem and developers to start pushing app updates that leverage the new AI APIs.",23,10,Soft-Bike8417,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/1egukks/apple_intelligence_waitlist/,1egukks

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-07-17 11:20:50,r/stocks,Am I missing something?,"I was researching the difference between total outstanding shares vs float, and apparently most companies do not exclude instituional shares from float because they are traded on exchanges as well. My example is Apple, which despite having 57.59% institutionally owned shares its float is 15.31b of its 15.33b shares. What I don’t understand, however, is how it says 5.22% of shares are owned by insiders, which I thought was not included in public float calculation. However the float is 99.8%, not 94.78% or whatever; so clearly at least the vast majority of these shares are counted. Is it only certain restricted shares that are not counted? Also the only article I could really find on this on titan.com said some companies calculate institutional shares as part of public float, some don’t. Are there any examples of some that don’t? Thanks in advance.

Can someone who is knowledgeable about this explain how china tariffs affect the profitability of Apple products since they’re partly manufactured in China?  But hasn’t Apple stock price gone up since Trump’s first presidency from when those tariffs were first placed, so it didn’t effect them and won’t in the future if he is elected - I’m hoping.

Initially, I was being dumb and bought a ton of penny stocks like soundhound and just lost a bit of money, because I don’t have much money at my disposal. 

I currently have $1300 invested, and I know this is not much at all. However, I would like some advice to build off my current portfolio as I earn more money from working. 

I currently have: 
1 AMZN 
1 AAPL 
6 INTC 
10 RIVN 
1 HOOD 
2 SYM 
1 Tesla 
Some VOO 

I’m planning to invest about  $300 into crypto. 

I would like to humbly request advice on how I should change or fix my portfolio? Should I sell some, buy some more? Hold some? Thank you in advance ",24,23,Prudent_March9571,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1e0l80g/how_to_structure_a_portfolio_at_18/,1e0l80g

Just recently started to invest more and more into companies like Apple, Google, Meta, etc.  I was looking at options and reading up on what they are.  I dabbled in a few small OTM call options, I guess looking for that lotto ticket. On a whim, I was looking at apples growth and purchase 1 contract expiring 8/16 at a $235 strike price at 1.19. As of right now we are currently at a $6.93 price point with 37 DTE.  

What are some good strategies at this point?  Should I consider selling it?  Hold on since it’s close to strike price and 37 DTE? Roll position? 

Up 482.3% return with today specifically at 41.43%.

2024-07-10 19:23:44,r/AAPL,APPL Investor/Traders unique opportunity ahead,"As we all know there is a perfect storm for a refresh cycle approaching. This is in part to  iPhones reaching the 5 year mark since the pandemic, plus new chips for iPhones,  iPads and laptops that will handle the improved AI capabilities with Siri, along with  a growing service revenue and possible uptick in China sales. 

This is where the importance of the retail trade comes into play…basically little.  The fact is that the retail trade will do practically nothing to push this stock. But there is a way for an investor or trader to help the stock momentum and is highly unique to AAPL. That is to buy the new iPhone 16 in Sept. Buy the phone and show it to as many people as you can. If you show 10 people and 3 of them buy the phone and those 3 show 10 people and so on…that will create momentum in sales. The consumer is going to move AAPL share price one way or the other in Nov 2024 earnings. 

This coming earnings is not expected to show a big uptick in iPhone sales. Usually this last quarter is pretty quiet with refreshes coming in Sept. But there have been reports that laptop sales have increased along with he services revenue. This is a tailwind. If anything a decent earnings report in Aug. will assist in keeping the share price supported around these current levels. A big move will be off of the Nov 2024 and Jan 2025 earnings. This is highly dependent on the refresh cycle playing out in iPhone sales. Any increase in China sales or an announcement of partnership with Baidu will also push AAPL higher. When the Fed starts cutting rates this will lower financing costs and provide another tailwind for APPL. 

So put some money aside to buy a iPhone 16 in Sept. and if you have the means buy a new iPad or Laptop as well. In some cases you may use the purchase of a new laptop as a tax write off, but check with your CPA.  For the contrarian opinions...I fully undersand I am going to receive negative comments but for those that are in AAPL it is important you upgrade your APPL products.

2024-07-09 00:14:54,r/stocks,"MSFT and AAPL are overvalued and overbought, Wallstreet is expecting too much from AI. ","I got to try Microsoft's copilot this week and i have to say i was underwhelmed by what it had to offer. It just felt like an enhancement for windows with more features, nothing ground breaking. This wasn't a major leap in technology like going from fax's to email. Tech companies releasing new (free)upgrades and new (free)products is like Nike releasing a new pair of shoes, just something else to add to the lineup. Will it make SOME peoples jobs more efficient, yes. Is it applicable for most people, i have to say no. Nike makes shoes for athletes but maybe 1-2% actually use them for what its intended for. Lets say a company has 20,000 employees, of those employees how many need it for their role or will using it on a daily basis? Maybe 90 % wont. If that's accurate a company will only pay for the 10% that need a user license.

If chat GPT was never released all the mag 7 earnings would still be about the same without it.

Now for the overvalued and overbought. MSFT has a PE of 40, one of the highest of all the mag 7. Your paying $40 for every dollar they earn. Based on their current AI stack im not sure they will be able to beat the current expectations in a big way consistently. MSFT is not NVDA. NVDA chips cost $30k+ each, as much as a low end Tesla. Copilot has a free version and the pro version is $20-$30 per user. Most people at companies are not using this and im not sure this will add to the bottom line very much. That means most of the earnings growth will have to come from the cloud business, admittedly the cloud business has been growing at double digits for a long time but there is also a lot of competition in cloud space, at some point growth will slow as cap ex spending slows. The other thing to consider is what AI costs for these companies. The GPU's are expensive, Data storage is expensive and the energy demand from AI use is very very expensive. At some point AI use, especially from free users is going to eat into the profit margins.

MSFT right now is like buying a over priced Cadillac, yeah it drives nice but its overpriced.

AAPL is also overvalued at 35x earnings. Adding chatGPT to a smartphone and enhancing siri isn't worth the current valuation. The goggles were a bust. No new products on the horizon just same stuff just newer versions. Apple isn't the glamorous high growth tech company it once was. Iphones sales are falling off in China and this will definitely show in the next couple quarters of earnings. Its the Nike of tech stocks. People aren't spending $100 for shoes they certainly wont spend $900+ for a phone. I wouldn't be surprised if Buffet starts to offload shares at this PE ratio.

That fourth industrial revolution is not happening today or tomorrow, we are too early. This is going to take some time.

I agree with Ken Griffin on this, the current AI products on the market are not the revolution many are hoping for, they're mediocre at best. There's too much spending and too much free products for this to add to any company's bottom line. The real winners are semi's, data storage and anything surrounding it.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-07-02 17:04:13,r/stocks,"Only interrupt compounding, unless it's absolutely necessary.","So I hope you are all doing fine with your portfolios. I checked my YTD performance due to mid-year. I am up 21% (30th June) vs the S&amp;P's about 14%. I just realized something I never really thought of before, because I was not a huge seller so far. My performance would have been much better without taking tax hits from selling stocks.

I am from Europe, tax hit is about 26% on all gains above 1000€(annually) when selling. I mean, I knew it before, but I just realized it this year, as my tax hits are 4 figures now. I do understand more and more why Warren B. says “If you aren't thinking about owning a stock for ten years, don't even think about owning it for ten minutes.” The most important part is really to not interrupt compounding.

Take for example AAPL. €10k invested in AAPL in January would be +17% €11.7k. You would have beaten the market when holding. If you sell: €1.7k gains 26% taxed left about €11.25k left. You would be up only up about 11% and been beaten by the index after selling. Index-funds have the big advantage, that they get taxed only at the very end, that way you don't interrupt compounding. I mean this is no rocket science and I am dumb to realize this only now, but the recent tax hits really opened my eyes.

To end this post with something useful: How is your portfolio doing? Have you beaten the S&amp;P? What's your % YTD?

TLDR: Tax on my investments is destroys my gains. Never interrupt compounding, unless it's absolutely necessary.",113,45,Abysswalker794,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dto192/only_interrupt_compounding_unless_its_absolutely/,1dto192

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2024-06-18 17:15:29,r/AAPL,XLK rebalancing 06/21 NVDA and AAPL,"As many of you know the XLK is rebalancing this Friday June 21st. Two major changes is the weighting of NVDA and AAPL. Currently NVDA is around 6% and AAPL is 22% of the XLK. Friday NVDA will be around 21% and AAPL will be around 4.5%. That means around 10 billion purchased shares of NVDA and 11 billion shares of APPL sold. 

Historically, the performance of a stock like NVDA can experience an increase in price movement going into the  ETF rebalancing and see a sell off following, as the rebalancing is digested and profit taking occurs.

For AAPL the opposite can occur as a short term negative selling pressure takes place going into the rebalancing. However post rebalancing is sometimes viewed as a buying opportunity. 

As this will occur after hours on 6/21 a lot of buying and selling could occur before the market opens on the following Monday.

2024-06-17 19:15:52,r/stocks,"Nvidia to get 20% weighting and billions in investor demand, while Apple demoted in major tech fund","KEY POINTS

* Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21% in this tech ETF, while Apple will be down to about 4.5%, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.
* The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.
* The ETF has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion.



[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)’s blistering rally will force a major technology exchange-traded fund to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares of the chip giant while cutting dramatically back on [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/).

The index that the [Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLK/) follows will soon rebalance, based on an adjusted market cap value from Friday’s close. The new calculations show [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) as the top stock in the index, followed by Nvidia and then Apple, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.

All three stocks would have a weight above 20% in the index if there were not caps in place. But diversification rules for the index limit how big the cumulative weight of stocks with at least a 5% share of the fund can be.

As a result, Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21%, while Apple will fall sharply to about 4.5%, Bartolini said.

That is a change from the prior weightings, which saw Nvidia’s weight be kept artificially low by index rules. As of June 14, Microsoft and Apple were both at about 22% each in the fund, while Nvidia was just 6%.

  
The race to finish in the top two came down to the final day. As of Monday, market cap data from FactSet shows that all three companies are over $3.2 trillion and within $50 million of each other, though that data does differ slightly from the calculations used in the index.

The XLK has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion. SPDR does not comment on specific trading strategies around rebalances.

The big shift in the XLK is an extreme example of how even passive index funds can diverge, especially when focusing on narrow slices of the market.

“Understanding how they might be weighted, where they’re allocated, what the rebalance frequency is, is really important because it can create differences in exposures and make what’s beneath the label seem different from fund to fund,” Bartolini said.

The fund follows the Technology Select Sector Index from S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, which uses a float-adjusted calculation to determine market cap. The rebalance officially takes effect at the end of this week.

The free-float adjustment for market cap accounts for large holders of an individual stock that are unlikely to be trading on a daily basis. For example, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 5% of Apple, which could count against it in the index, Bartolini said.

“Its free-float market capitalization is reduced because you have so many controlled interests in the company,” Bartolini said.

The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.

On Monday, shares of Apple were up 1.8%, while Nvidia ticked up 0.2%.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Nvidia briefly surpassed Apple to become the world's second most valuable company last week, amid strong demand for its AI server chips, but Apple has now regained second place with a $3.1 trillion market cap as of writing.

2024-06-10 01:18:01,r/stocks,Apple's (AAPL) Rollercoaster: Should You Jump In Now?,"If you’ve been keeping an eye on Apple (AAPL), you know it’s been a wild ride lately. The stock took a beating in the first four months of 2024, dropping 8% while the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index climbed 6%. Why? Stagnant growth and a DOJ lawsuit knocked investor confidence. But then May came along, and Apple bounced back with a 12% surge thanks to strong Q2 results for fiscal 2024, announced on May 2.

**Quick Stats**

* **Current Price:** $196.89 (+1.24%)
* **Market Cap:** $3,019B
* **52-Week Range:** $164.07 - $199.62
* **Volume:** 53M (Avg: 60M)

**What's Driving the Turnaround?**

Apple’s revenue for Q2 2024 dipped 4% year-over-year to $90.8 billion, mainly because iPhone sales fell to $46 billion from $51.3 billion last year. But here’s the kicker: Apple’s earnings per share nudged up to $1.53, beating the $1.50 expectation. The services sector is where Apple shone, raking in a record $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year. This area is a goldmine for Apple, bolstering its bottom line even when hardware sales lag.

Looking ahead, Apple expects revenue to pick up in the current quarter, driven by services and a bounce back in iPad sales. Given that iPhones contribute to half of Apple’s revenue, any uptick in smartphone sales will be a big win. The global smartphone market is on a comeback, with 7.8% growth in Q1 2024, according to IDC, and AI-enabled smartphones could be a game changer this year.

**AI: The Next Big Catalyst**

Apple’s rumored to be diving into the AI smartphone market with iOS 18. Features like AI-powered transcripts, message summaries, and even a smarter Siri could debut soon. AI enhancements are expected to drive another upgrade cycle, and with Apple holding a 17% share in the smartphone market, this could be huge.

**Should You Buy In?**

Analysts are bullish. Wedbush Securities sees Apple’s AI-enabled iPhones kicking off a major upgrade cycle, upping their price target to $275 from $250—a potential 45% gain from current levels. The median 12-month price target is $202, suggesting a 6% upside.

Here’s the play: Apple’s trading at 29 times trailing earnings, which is a discount compared to the Nasdaq-100’s 31 times. With analysts revising their earnings expectations upwards and AI developments on the horizon, this might be the moment to get in before Apple starts another run.

**Action Plan:**

1. **Buy Zone:** Under $195, if you’re looking for a solid entry.
2. **Sell Targets:** Short-term around $202; long-term riding the wave towards $275.
3. **Watch List:** Keep an eye on AI updates and quarterly earnings for quick reaction opportunities.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

""TSMC's wafer price is indeed too low,"" said Huang at a Computex investor luncheon in Taipei on Wednesday.""I think TSMC's \[service\] price is too low,"" and that ""TSMC’s contribution to the world and the tech industry is under-presented by its financial results,"" he added.""NVIDIA is TSMC’s key customer and accounts for 10% of TSMC’s 2024 revenue, we estimate,"" said Morgan Stanley analyst Charlie Chan and others in a note. ""We believe that if NVIDIA accepted price hikes, other key AI semi customers may follow.""

""We think NVIDIA's management recognizes TSMC’s reliability, as it helps remove one of the largest risk factors – foundry production,"" Chan added.NVIDIA did not confirm the timing or amount of a wafer price increase.TSMC hiked its prices by 10% in 2022 and another 5% in 2023. Morgan Stanley believes TSMC could raise prices by another 5% for 2025, due to AI semi demand.

Other major TSMC customers include Apple (AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Qualcomm (QCOM) and MediaTek (OTCPK:2454-TK).""We believe TSMC will be a winner in AI semis in the long term,"" Chan noted. ""No matter where the growth is coming from – GPU or ASIC, cloud or edge AI chips – most, if not all, will likely be manufactured by TSMC's leading-edge foundry services.""Morgan Stanley rates TSMC Overweight, as most analysts are very bullish on the stock.

2024-06-06 16:27:42,r/AAPL,Apple AI strategy next week / the next few months,"Hi folks. Long time Apple investor here. For some reason, a long walk with my dog this morning got me putting some things together in my head. Happy to hear alternatives, but most important is how something like this would affect the stock in the short and long term.

I get the feeling after reading several reports that Apple could use WWDC to talk up the inclusion of AI in their OSs in this way:

Similar to how you can choose Google or Bing or DuckDuckGo for search, you'd be able to choose OpenAI or Copilot (or as we are hearing, no AI at all). That choice would tie into search, the OS and core apps, and finally third party apps when they are updated to allow that integration. So Apple as usual is the gatekeeper and has a big hand in security.

Since Apple ""buying time"" and playing ""catch-up"" seem to be pretty strong themes lately, this would give developers the next few months to update apps, while Apple readies more M4 (""great for AI"") devices than the lone new iPads (for the fall and winter perhaps). It also gives Apple time to improve and finally release their own AI integration, which could then be one more choice (TBD on if or when they'd drop the others).

To me, that strategy wouldn't be a big wow, but it would be solid and not concern me much stock-wise in the long term.

I'm not sure if Apple would talk up OpenAI etc, while in the same breath also saying ""we've got our own (even better) thing coming soon"". Stock-wise however, I feel if they somehow can hit that last point, the short-term effect on the stock is better than if they don't.",12,3,[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/1d9jiep/apple_ai_strategy_next_week_the_next_few_months/,1d9jiep

I get you shouldn’t rely on their reports to make investment decisions, but maybe use it for starting research and for informational purposes.

What justifies certain analysts like from Wedbush, Bank of America or Tigress financials being so bullish on Apple stock, in the wake of WWDC  
- Do they know something we don’t know?  Are they in any way incentified to give good ratings or are they truly independent?

Even if Apple comes out with Ai features, wouldn’t other companies already have similar features or could build similar features?  Not too techy myself, but was taking a look at some leaked features, and it doesn’t seem over the top amazing.  How can this lead to the growth these analysts are saying?

Everyone in my house has iPhones, we have always preferred them over other phones, but we hesitate to buy a new phone because of the high price and not so much a change from prior year, I’m sure in this economy, other people are thinking the same, ie the high price?

Even if more people buy iPhones this September, are these analysts saying that Apple will add AI features in each successive model that will drive a lot of growth?

I just don’t see the growth without a new successful product, which is definitely a possibility given it’s Apple but to repeat another iPhone era…

Thinner ipad, who cares?  New chip, no software yet to take advantage of it probably for the better part of a year.  Virt Reality, no killer app to drive it.  AI, they seem to be late in their development, although Apple has always been the greatest at their catchup/surpassing game.  I think there maybe better options for me, looking for a sounding board.  Still looking to keep it in steadily plodding behemoths for ease of mind, but something better than flat YTD performance i got out of apple this year.

First up MSFT, up 14% YTD, has a wide moat, seems to be well positioned for AI, although their gaming sector is looking kinda soft to me.  Like their latest offerings in pc with infused AI, and tablet.

Next up AMZN, up 21% YTD, also a wide moat, with a lot of stability in their supplied items and businesses.  Nothing really lights up the sky, just plodding along.  I think they have an AI strength used in their background business, but has an appearance of hiding, as it has no consumer face to it.

Lastly NVDA, up 110% YTD.  They are definitely the star of the moment, and I think there is still gas in this tank, but being a hardware vendor mostly with some software driven solutions for AI for their platform alone, they may have locked up a good lead that will only grow.

Looking at doing a 50/25/25 split (MSFT/AMZN/NVDA), thoughts?  Would love to hear any positive or negative on this.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS &amp; revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

","*Consumers will soon have access to* [*yet another streaming bundle*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-streaming-wars-are-over-morning-brief-100018167.html)*. Comcast (*[*CMCSA*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CMCSA)*) CEO Brian Roberts said early Tuesday that later this month, the company will launch a new offering that combines its Peacock platform, Netflix (*[*NFLX*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/?fr=sycsrp_catchall)*), and Apple TV+ (*[*AAPL*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/?fr=sycsrp_catchall)*).*

*The new bundle, referred to as StreamSaver, will be available to customers of Comcast’s broadband internet service, the executive revealed at a MoffettNathanson conference.*

*""Those three products will come at a vastly reduced price to anything in the market today and be available to all our customers,"" Roberts said. Exact pricing details will be announced at a later date.*

*""We've been bundling video successfully and creatively for 60 years,"" he added. ""This is the latest iteration of that, and I think this will be a pretty compelling package.""*

*The developments come as media companies face pressure from investors to scale their streaming services and achieve profitability. At the same time, the companies are dealing with more competition from tech giants like Amazon (*[*AMZN*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/?fr=sycsrp_catchall)*) and YouTube (*[*GOOGL*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)*,* [*GOOG*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)*), which are* [*gobbling up*](https://sports.yahoo.com/amazon-wins-nfl-playoff-game-025638395.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall) *streaming deals.*

That means fewer opportunities for streamers to retain loyal subscribers over time.*

*The concept of bundling isn't new. Companies in the space have been doing it with their own services for years. Apple, for instance, offers Apple One, which combines Apple TV+ with other services like Apple Music and Apple Arcade. The bundle launched globally in late 2020.*

*Disney, which has also been offering a bundle with Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+,*[ *officially*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-begins-integrating-hulu-disney-170000387.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall) *began its domestic rollout of*[ *a one-app experience*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disneys-iger-pivots-on-hulu-stance-now-says-general-entertainment-very-positive-224831488.html) *late last year that incorporates Hulu content via Disney+ — a similar play to*[ *Paramount's Showtime combination*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paramount-with-showtime-to-launch-june-27-184752031.html) *as well as the integration of*[ *HBO Max and Discovery+*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-launches-max-platform-in-bid-for-streaming-dominance-093040851.html)*, which both merged their respective services last year.*

*Just last week, Warner Bros.

1. The Vision Pro was a dud, they’re pulling back manufacturing/production

2. iPhone sales are down almost 10%

3. Services didn’t grow as much as we thought they would

4. Apple doing a buyback instead of investing more in R&amp;D (it seems like they’re doing a lot of buybacks lately..)

5. Slow growth in critical markets like China

6. No major product line releases in the future. The Vision Pro was a dud and was too expensive - they thought about doing a car but cancelled that. What’s the next new thing? 

Do I think Apple is doomed? Absolutely not. I love their products, especially the m series MacBooks.

&gt;A landmark antitrust case pitting Google (GOOG, GOOGL) against the Justice Department entered its final stage this past week as prosecutors from the federal government and 14 states said in their closing arguments that Google illegally monopolized the online search and search advertising markets.

&gt;A government win would certainly threaten a giant piece of Google’s $237.8 billion profit engine. But the outcome, which will be decided by US District Judge Amit Mehta in the weeks or months to come, also has giant implications for some of the other big names in the tech world.

&gt;That's because Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims, and because all three stand to lose or gain depending on the outcome.

&gt;The government argues Google is violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act by blocking competitors from entering three distinct markets: general online search, search advertising, and search text advertising.

&gt;A government win would put at risk the billions of dollars in mutually lucrative contracts between Google and Apple, as well as deals with other device manufacturers and telecom companies.

&gt; The government alleged in its case that Google pays billions of dollars each year to LG, Motorola (MSI), and Samsung; major US wireless carriers such as AT&amp;T (T), T-Mobile (TMUS), and Verizon (VZ); and browser developers such as Mozilla, Opera, and UCWeb.

&gt;Government prosecutors have alleged that Google had been paying Apple an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion per year — a portion of search ad revenue — in exchange for awarding Google Search default placement on Apple devices.

&gt;The government has yet to say what precise remedy it desires should it prevail against Google. If the government does win on any of its claims, a separate remedies phase of the trial would be held.",523,52,TheYoungLung,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ckv9wx/the_ending_of_googles_monopoly_trial_has_silicon/,1ckv9wx

2024-04-05 19:36:31,r/AAPL,ReALM is not getting nearly enough attention,"Apple is once again entering a new market with patience and looking at the problem from a human perspective, not simply focusing on harnessing and optimizing the underlying technology (which they also do well, obv).

With ReALM, they are approaching the problem in two key ways: 

* Build a model that outperforms ChatGPT 4, others, substantially. 
* Provide a more natural way of interacting with AI based agents

The second point is the most compelling, and we begin to see Apple's strategy play out. Essentially what they are doing is building an ever present awareness on their devices of what customers are doing on screen. So for example, if you have an iPad, MacBook Pro, and iPhone, Apple's future devices equipped with AI will be aware and processing everything, including screen activities but also as well potentially listening or even seeing what is going on around you. 

This is interesting for two reasons: 

1. Apple will ship a decentralized, on device AI processing power and model. Since it's on device, it will naturally be faster and more secure
2. The multi modality of the interactions opens up a tremendous amount of new use cases for AI in every day life. The new tech will also lay the foundation for other agents and devices (see they are now trying to build robots)

For companies like Microsoft and OpenAI, they have the models, they have the software, but Apple has YOU. They are easily the most well positioned to build and sell a whole new generation of technology built upon this idea, and I have no doubt they are going to end up being a huge player in the AI race.

When John Ternus and Jony Srouji were asked about if they were buying Nvidia chips they just said we can't say. Cramer even asked him how people could ""get right"" by Jen-Hsun and Jen-Hsun simply answered ""oh, everyone's already right by me"", indicating he'd work with anyone. 
 
Any major AI player that isn't is handicapping themselves by not using the massive ML libraries already built out for CUDA, which is the actual thing that makes Nvidia so sticky for training hardware more so than the hardware itself. 

So I've been wondering, is there any inkling or scrap about what Apple's state of training compute actually is? We have Meta buying massive massive amounts of H100s, Microsoft Amazon and Google up there with massive training systems, everyone of substance seems to be, but we know so little about the state of Apple's training compute.

2024-03-08 13:39:29,r/AAPL,Here is how WWDC will go down (with Gemini's help),"This sounds so plausible to me given they've had some time to sit back and watch....classic Apple.

My prompt was ""Create a fictional tim cook wwdc presentation about the new AI features coming to iPhone. Stress thinking differently about AI, trust and security in providing information, and responsibility."" 

Reimagine Intelligence: A New Era for iPhone
Tim Cook takes the WWDC stage to a thunderous applause. A spotlight illuminates a sleek silhouette behind a black curtain.

Tim Cook: Good morning, everyone! Today, we enter a new chapter in the iPhone experience. A chapter driven by a powerful force – intelligence. But not just any intelligence. An intelligence that respects your privacy, understands your needs, and empowers you to create like never before.

The curtain dramatically reveals a massive screen displaying the iOS 18 logo.

Tim Cook: For years, AI has been defined by a singular vision –  one where intelligence resides in the cloud, away from you. At Apple, we believe differently. We believe intelligence should be where it's most beneficial: on your iPhone, securely embedded within your trusted device.

A slide showcases a split screen. One side displays a generic smartphone, the other the iPhone.

Tim Cook: This is intelligence by design. This is the Apple Neural Engine, the most powerful chip ever created for a smartphone, now with even greater capabilities. It analyzes your data on your device, protecting your privacy while unlocking a new world of possibilities.

The presentation dives into specific features: Siri vastly improves its understanding of natural language, Messages suggests witty replies and completes sentences, and the Health app offers proactive recommendations.

Tim Cook: AI should not just be smart, it should be trustworthy. That's why we build every feature with privacy at its core. Your data is yours, and it stays on your device. On-device intelligence ensures not only your privacy but also a level of responsiveness that surpasses anything else.

The focus shifts to a new feature – a privacy dashboard that allows users to control how their data is used to power AI features.

Tim Cook:  We understand the power of AI comes with responsibility.  That's why we're giving you complete control. You choose how your data is used to personalize your experience.

The presentation concludes with a montage of users seamlessly interacting with their iPhones using AI features.

Tim Cook: The future of intelligence is on your iPhone. It's intelligence that empowers you, protects you, and redefines what a phone can do. This is iPhone. Reimagined.

The audience erupts in applause as the lights dim.

this report uses the 15m timeframe, and looks at the 15m opening range stats. it shows how often price breaks above, below, above and below, and doesn't break out of the opening 15m range.

this measures only the first break on a 15m timeframe after the 15m opening range is formed, not the following breaks.

I pulled data on AAPL from the past 6 months and found that AAPL breaks below the 15 min opening range 64% of the time on Wednesday's. 

you can use this report to scalp around market open, if price is in a downtrend and breakouts are more likely to occur, you can look for a short entry targeting the breakout.",5,3,GetEdgeful,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/1b5ruz5/aapl_breaks_below_the_15_min_opening_range_64_of/,1b5ruz5

2024-02-27 12:33:57,r/AAPL,Increase AAPL holdings,"Hi together, I'm looking for some insights on whether I should increase my holdings in AAPL at the moment. I initially bought into AAPL during the COVID dip back in 2020, and my holdings have grown to approximately 4,600 EUR since then, constituting around 15% of my total stock and index fund portfolio.

I am playing with the idea of increasing my AAPL holdings as I believe AAPL will remain relevant and continue to grow its revenue while having an excellent return on capital (ROIC). However, I'm hesitant about the timing. As a long-term investor, I shouldn't care about timing, I know. But I still want to buy it at a ""discount"".

Given that AAPL is currently trading below its 200-day moving average, do you think now is a good time to increase AAPL exposure, or would it be wiser to wait a bit longer?

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and insights!

**AAPL's performance on** **Thursday's**

AAPL closes green roughly 61% of the time. this means that on most Thursday's, the stock finishes the day **higher** than the previous day's closing price.

it closes in the red about 39% of Thursday's. this indicates a drop below the previous day's closing price by the end of the day.

**understanding green &amp; red days by weekday:**

this report shows how often a weekday closes green or red.

**green:** shows how often a certain day has closed green / higher than the previous day's close.

**red:** shows how often a certain day has closed red / lower than the previous day's close.

**why green &amp; red days by weekday matter:**

certain weekdays can have specific performance tendencies, seeing the data can help you pick a direction on the day, set profit targets, and stop losses.

if mondays generally close green, this gives you context on which direction to lean toward. if the stock opens below the green/red price, you can look for an entry below targeting that green/red price.",8,3,GetEdgeful,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/1agmmo9/how_often_does_aapl_close_green_on_thursdays/,1agmmo9

**understanding range to ATR by weekday:**

this report zeroes in on how a stock moves in relation to its Average True Range (ATR - the average amount a stock will move in one day) for each day of the week. in simpler terms, it's about spotting differences in volatility between weekdays.

if Monday generally moves 85.2% of ATR, and ATR is $3.2, you can expect a move of 2.7 for the day, 85.2% of $3.2 = $2.7. each weekday is different, some provide better opportunities than others.

**why ATR matters:**

a stock's **range generally stays within its ATR**, don't hope for your trade to continue beyond the ATR, it happens but it's unlikely.

recognizing which days a stock is more or less volatile than its average can be a game-changer for trading strategy.

if you know a stock typically moves less than its ATR on **Tuesdays** but covers its full ATR on **Thursdays**, you can tailor your expectations and strategies accordingly.

**range to ATR:**

Friday's average is 87.7%, and ATR is $3.2, you can expect AAPLto move $2.8 today.

$2.8 is 87.7% of the $3.2 ATR

in simple terms, ATR helps you set your entry &amp; profit targets, find reversal points, and maximize winning trades. looking at this by weekday will help you refine your trading depending on the day of the week, they're all different.

**understanding consecutive bars report:**

a ‘consecutive green (or red) streak‘ is a series of green (or red) candles. each of these candles represents a time frame where the closing price is higher (or lower) than its opening price. when you see these green candles line up one after the other, it's an indication of momentum.

traders pay close attention to these streaks as they can provide valuable insights. they reveal not only the strength of the current bullish (or bearish) trend but also hint at its potential to continue. monitoring these streaks helps in understanding market dynamics and making informed decisions.

**why consecutive green &amp; red bars matter:**

recognizing a stock's streak patterns hints at its momentum, potentially helping traders anticipate if a trend might continue or reverse.

longer streaks, either green or red, might indicate stronger market sentiment in a particular direction.

**green streak**

AAPL's longest streak of green 15min candles in a day is, on average, 4.20. the max consecutive 15min candles in the last 1 year is 11 candles.

**red streak**

AAPL's longest streak of red 15min candles in a day is, on average, 3.71. the max consecutive 15min candles in the last 1 year is 10 candles.

**pro tip:**

this doesn't mean buy and sell if when you're coming up on the averages, but it's something to keep in mind when you're looking to set entries, exits, and stop losses. if you're a scalper, you don't want to takes trades hoping for moves farther out then the averages, it'll likely reverse on you. if you day trade, the pullback could be a great opportunity to add to a winning position if the momentum is strong enough in the direction of your trade.",4,1,GetEdgeful,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/19bvao1/a_breakdown_of_aapls_green_red_streaks_in_the/,19bvao1

Apple WTD -6.6%): Has been hammered in the past week, amid several negative catalysts. (1) Received a downgrade at Barclays, which cited concerns that demand for its devices (iPhone &amp; Mac) will remain weak in 2024. (2) The following day, received another downgrade at Piper Sandler for the aforementioned reasons. (3) The US aims to file an antitrust case against Apple’s strategies to protect the dominance of the iPhone.  
My Opinion? Price action following broker downgrades are more-so a “rotation“ out of Tech in the new year, rather than Apple investors “jumping ship“ (Nasdaq WTD -3.3%). Going ahead, the main catalyst will be government’s anti-trust trial against Google, which may have a significant impact on Apple’s revenue. I will cover this closer to the closing arguments in May

2024-01-05 19:42:38,r/AAPL,Tim Apple needs to make some changes.... [small rant],"I'm not super worried about this dip,  we've seen this shit before.  Many times before.


*However*, I think they've been playing catch up in too many areas.   The iPhone has been
barely incremental over the past few years.    If you're about to buy a new phone,  go take a 
look at your options - You'll save a ton of cash with a 13 or 14 with minimal FOMO. 
I get that it's a staple,  it's their Coca-cola and you don't want to fuck too much with the formula.
That being said,  they at least need to push enough for people to upgrade.  One of
the more substantial changes (USBC),  wasn't due to any innovative drive, but because
the fucking EU told them to.   

Furthermore,  we need some products that may actually drive revenue in the not too distant future.   The phone market has peaked and it's a lot like the Apple IIe from many moons ago.
A profitable cash cow that will slowly but eventually dry up down the road.  What could that new product be? No idea.

As for the Vision Pro...   It's not going to make any measurable dent in revenue for years and years.  As an owner of the Quest3,  I def see a lot of possibilities,  but the tech is still wildly immature.   In Tim Apple's defense,  he's never really pumped it as anything more than a tech demo (for now).  In 5-10 years who knows,  I could def see it in many homes across the land.

I think it's a mistake to rely too heavily on services.  It's been a solid performer no doubt,  but we've seen how quickly service centric business can get their nuts punched in...  

Having said all of that,  I have no doubt Tim has some surprises for us this year.  Not selling,  but a tad frustrated ....",13,8,Dry-Opportunity5148,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/18ze4rt/tim_apple_needs_to_make_some_changes_small_rant/,18ze4rt

for the sake of this scenario, let's say you're looking to find the weekday where $AAPL has the highest volume &amp; the highest range, because, like me, you find that high volume generally leads to moves having more followthrough and high range makes it easier for you to find profitable entries and exits because you don't have to be so precise. 

if we look at the avg. volume &amp; avg. range by weekday chart - we see that Wednesday's tend to have the highest range and Friday's the highest trading volume. personally, in this case, I'm gonna go with Wednesday because I prefer to prioritize high range when having to pick between the two. what we see is that the range on Wednesday's has historically been roughly $3.20.

moving on to the range to ATR by weekday chart, we see that historically, $AAPL has covered 95.8% of its range on Wednesday's. meaning that price, on average, moves $3.06.

while historical trends and patterns don't necessarily guarantee future ones, we can estimate based on the averages what has the highest probability of happening. 

no matter what your trading style is, these insights can be used to estimate price movements.

That decrease brought Apple back under $3 trillion, but it happened chiefly because of what were described as investor jitters.  


This pattern repeated itself in [June 2023](https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/06/30/apple-is-the-worlds-biggest-company-at-3-trillion----again/), as Apple's valuation went back up over $3 trillion -- only to again fall steadily immediately afterwards.  


June was when Apple announced its forthcoming [Apple Vision Pro](https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-vision-pro), and since then it has also launched the iPhone 15 range. But while investment analysts have been mixed in their advice about Apple, there have been issues over the iPhone 15 [not selling as well as the ](https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/09/04/apple-supply-chain-receives-fewer-iphone-15-orders-than-iphone-14/)[iPhone 14](https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone-14), especially [in China](https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/10/16/iphone-15-fails-to-match-iphone-14-in-chinese-sales).  


On December 5, Apple share price rose 2% to $193.42 per share. The trend continues on Wednesday morning, with the stock inching up in pre-market trading.  


It's not clear how long it will retain that valuation, however. Apple routinely buys back stock, and Apple has already said that it does not expect annual revenue growth for its December quarter. This is the first full quarter where the iPhone 15 range was available, but could now be the fifth quarter in a row where Apple has seen [declining sales](https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/11/02/apple-suffers-fourth-consecutive-quarter-of-declining-sales).

what is average true range (ATR)? ATR is essentially the high &amp; the low of a stock on any given day. so let's say ATR is $10 - you can expect the high to the low to have a range of $10, roughly.   


now let's look at what it means for a stock to exceed and respect a $10 ATR. if ATR is respected, it means the price moves less than $10 and if ATR is exceeded, it means the price moves more than $10.   


in the example with $AAPL here, we can see that on average, on Thursday's, ATR gets respected 68% of the time on Thursday's and gets exceeded 38% of the time on Thursday's.   


in simple terms, looking at ATR helps you set your entry &amp; profit targets, find reversal points and maximize winning trades. ",4,1,GetEdgeful,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/187qsnu/average_true_range_atr_what_is_it_and_how_can_you/,187qsnu

gap fills - what are they, and how can they help you? a gap fill is when a stock's price today reaches yesterday's closing price. here's an example. if $AAPL closed at $100 yesterday, opened at $110 today, and at some point during the day touched $100, the gap is considered 'filled'. simple enough?   


now let's explore gaps up and gaps down before moving on. gap up: when today's opening price is higher than yesterday's closing price (think - if $AAPL closed at $100 yesterday and opened at $110 today). gap down: when today's opening price is lower than yesterday's closing price (think - if $AAPL closed at $100 yesterday and opened at $90 today).  


let's explore how you can use the gap fill data on this chart to guide your directional bias. let's say you're building a trading strategy for Tuesday. we notice that if $AAPL gaps up, there's a 73% chance it'll fill, and if it gaps down, there's a 77% chance it'll fill. if the data shows that $AAPL has a strong tendency to fill the gap, how would you structure your trading strategy?

for the sake of this example, let's focus on Friday. these reports show that on Friday's AAPL's average range is $2.75. this means that during market hours, the stock price will most likely fluctuate that amount. if we consider that on Friday's, the range to ATR (meaning how much of that $2.75 range the price tends to actually move) is 86.9%, we can estimate that the price will likely only move $2.38 on Friday's.  


how does this help you? well, if you know that on average, on Friday's, AAPL will most likely only move $2.38 - you can leverage those insights into your trading strategy to put the odds of a profitable trade in your favor.",10,6,GetEdgeful,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/17xehok/how_to_leverage_aapls_average_range_by_weekday/,17xehok

### understanding volume &amp; range:

high **volume** means there are a lot of people buying and selling, this generally provides smoother price movements, rather than choppy movements. **it's easier to make money when volume is high.**

higher **range** means the price movements are larger, when they're larger, you can **catch a smaller piece to make money**. you don't need to be as precise with entries and exits, because there's a larger move to capture.

* if a stock's range is $10 and you want to catch $4, you **only need 40%** of the move.
* if a stock's range is $5 and you want to catch $4, you **need 80%** of the move.

### why volume &amp; range matter:

looking at average volume &amp; range by weekday will help you determine **what days provide the best opportunity** to take profitable trades.

### breakdown of the volume &amp; range report:

if certain weekdays show **higher volume, prioritize trading on those days**over ones with lower volume. in this report, Thursday's and Friday's have the highest average volume.

if volume is even throughout the week, **prioritize trading on the days with the highest range**. in this report, Wednesday's and Thursday's have the highest average range.

**pro tip:** it's much easier to catch a small piece of a bigger move, than a bigger piece of a smaller move. trade on days with bigger moves – the highest average range!",5,3,GetEdgeful,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/177owd3/aapl_average_volume_range_by_weekday_ytd_as_of/,177owd3

2023-05-03 16:41:24,r/AAPL,AAPL squaring out in price and time," ***AAPL will release its Q1 results on May 4th, 2023, with a delay of more than a month. As read in “Barron’s on April 6th, 2023, is there a reason for a longer-than-usual-delay?”***

We may speculate about it or look at the cycles to see if shorter and longer-term cycles are due in time.

AAPL is also close to 360 degrees in price from low January 2023 on May 5th, 2023, right on the Lunar eclipse. A lunar cycle is due a few days later, on May 9th, 2023.

*There is perfect geometry if AAPL will change the trend again after an advance of $49. (like the $49 decline from the August 2022 High) from the lows of January 2023, reaching $173.17 by early to mid-of-May 2023.*

The number “49” is the square of “7,” and this is often a point of resistance (or support) in time and price.

As W.D. Gann mentioned in his stock market and commodity courses:

&gt;*“The number “7” is a fatal number referred to many times in the Bible, which brings about contraction, depression, and panics.”*

However this boost is already slowing down quarter on quarter and has a much further to go back before it normalises.  It's also going to normalise into a slowing market smartphone market.

2023-03-22 17:48:52,r/AAPL,"Apple, Microsoft Dominate U.S. Markets After FAANG Trade Fizzles","The combined weighting of Apple and Microsoft in the S&amp;P 500 has risen to the highest level on record

The FAANG era is apparently over. The U.S. market is dominated by just two stocks now. 

The combined weighting of [Apple](https://archive.is/o/wFMXU/https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AAPL) Inc. and [Microsoft](https://archive.is/o/wFMXU/https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MSFT) Corp. in the S&amp;P 500 has risen to 13.3%, the highest level on record, while the influence of other big technology stocks has waned of late. That is according to Strategas Securities data going back to 1990.

Not since [International Business Machines](https://archive.is/o/wFMXU/https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/IBM) Corp. and [AT&amp;T](https://archive.is/o/wFMXU/https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/T) in 1978 have two stocks made up a greater share of the benchmark, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.   
For much of the past decade, investors simultaneously bid up shares of Facebook parent [Meta Platforms](https://archive.is/o/wFMXU/https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/META) Inc., [Amazon.com](https://archive.is/o/wFMXU/https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN) Inc., Apple, [Netflix](https://archive.is/o/wFMXU/https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NFLX) Inc. and Google owner [Alphabet](https://archive.is/o/wFMXU/https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GOOG) Inc. The robust gains in the stocks year after year reinforced bets that they could only go up, helping the trade become so [popular that it earned the FAANG nickname](https://archive.is/o/wFMXU/https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-year-big-tech-stocks-fell-from-glory-11672543952?mod=article_inline).  
As their share prices surged, so did their concentration in the S&amp;P 500. At the peak in August 2020, the group swelled to make up about one-quarter of the index. Although that share has since edged down to 21%, some investors still worry the index is top-heavy and a significant pullback in a few stocks could [leave broader markets susceptible to a fall](https://archive.is/o/wFMXU/https://www.wsj.com/articles/stock-market-is-top-heavy-but-carnage-is-widespread-11652935180?mod=article_inline).

The big tech stocks began to diverge once worries about inflation began bubbling and the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates, dimming the allure of some growth stocks. 

Of course, they faced company-specific issues as well. Meta, for example, [has seen challenges stemming from competition](https://archive.is/o/wFMXU/https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-parent-meta-begins-new-round-of-job-cuts-e34b81cc?mod=article_inline) and privacy restrictions, while [Netflix has battled subscriber losses](https://archive.is/o/wFMXU/https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-shares-rise-as-content-drives-strong-subscriber-growth-11674234501?mod=article_inline) and struggled to control content costs.

Todd Sohn, ETF strategist at Strategas, said Apple and Microsoft have [emerged as havens in the stock market turmoil](https://archive.is/o/wFMXU/https://www.wsj.com/articles/regional-bank-chaos-clouds-outlook-for-markets-ed1b315?mod=article_inline), bringing their weightings in the S&amp;P 500 to 7.11% and 6.14%, respectively. The stocks have gained 23% and 14% in 2023 after suffering steep losses last year.

“It’s just been monumental,” Mr. Sohn said. “There’s just more comfort with the way Apple and Microsoft are viewed as opposed to going out and buying any tech name out there.”More broadly, investors have piled into tech stocks to [hide out from the banking crisis](https://archive.is/o/wFMXU/https://www.wsj.com/articles/regional-bank-chaos-clouds-outlook-for-markets-ed1b315?mod=article_inline) amid hopes that the[ Fed is nearing the end of its campaign raising interest rates](https://archive.is/o/wFMXU/https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-faces-tough-decision-on-rate-increase-681d6abc?mod=article_inline). The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite has rallied 3.5% this month, extending its 13% gain for the year, while the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.8% in March and has given up almost all of its early year advance.

Lori Van Dusen, founder and chief executive of LVW Advisors in Rochester, N.Y., cautions investors to actively pick stocks instead of just buying funds tied to an index, noting that the hefty weighting of tech companies during the dot-com bubble led to big market declines. “The index is more concentrated than it’s been. You’re just making a bet that these are going to be the places to be going forward and that’s usually a bad bet,” she said. “That is not the way to make money in the coming years.”",5,0,foreignfilmfiend,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/11youxj/apple_microsoft_dominate_us_markets_after_faang/,11youxj

2023-03-04 18:44:38,r/AAPL,Morgan Stanley Raises Apple Target Price to $180,"Investment bank Morgan Stanley has raised its Apple price target for the first time in eight months, based on its expectation of new launches and a possible [iPhone](https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone) subscription program.

Recently, Morgan Stanley's analysis of what proportion of Apple stock is owned by pension funds and other institutions, led to it recommending investors buy now. Key to that conclusion was what its analysts described as ""5 idiosyncratic tailwinds over the next 6-9 months that make Apple our top pick for 2023.""

Now in a note to investors seen by *AppleInsider*, Morgan Stanley has raised its Apple price target from $175 to $180 based on those same expectations. The new note breaks down much more detail in its analysis, but the five factors, or ""catalysts,"" remain:

1. **Services ""re-accelerating"" growth**
2. **Record gross margins**
3. **""Pent up demand"" for the** [**iPhone 15**](https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone-15)
4. **An Apple AR headset**
5. **Possible hardware subscription service**

The new note reiterates that Apple still faces ""a challenging macro backdrop, FX \[foreign exchange\] headlines"" plus "" iPhone production shortages, and lingering COVID restrictions.""

""However, if we look beyond the near-term,"" it says, ""we see a catalyst-rich event path over the next 12 months that is underappreciated by investors.""

""Combined, we believe the first 4 of these 5 catalysts have the potential to drive a re-rating in Apple shares toward our new sum-of-the-parts driven $180 price target,"" it continues, ""with the launch of a hardware subscription program key to unlocking our $230 LTV-driven bull case valuation.""

Morgan Stanley does predict that iPhone replacement cycles ""will extend to 4.4 years by the end of FY23,"" which is ""a new all-time record."" However, the company expects the average replacement cycle is ""set to contract in FY24, but conservatively assume to just 4.1 years.""

The analysts also believe that Apple's Services growth is under-appreciated. On the face of it, Services declined from ""strong double-digit growth in FY21 to mid-single digit Y/Y in the last 6-9 months.""

""However, underlying this deceleration has been the most extreme FX headwinds the company has faced as far back as we've tracked the data,"" says Morgan Stanley, ""which suggests that in constant currency, Services has still been growing low double-digits.""

In the near future, the firm says it expects to see ""a Services re-acceleration through the end of FY23 and into FY24."" That expectation is driven in part by the ""120M new iPhone users onboarded in CY22 that Apple can begin to monetize,"" and also an improvement in foreign exchange.

""History shows you want to own Apple stock 6-9 months ahead of key product launches,"" say the analysts, ""with Apple's new AR/VR headset and the [iPhone 15](https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone-15) launch both key upcoming catalysts.""

Apple has not announced either product, though, and the market for AR headsets is a [difficult one](https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/03/01/meta-leaks-its-ar-four-year-plan-before-apple-can-beat-them). However, Morgan Stanley thinks that even if it takes time for Apple's headset to become a success, it will.

""\[Our\] analysis of new product category launches shows the market has historically under-estimated the long-term impact of new product/services launches,"" it continues, ""that on average, have accounted for \~6% of revenue in any given year (over the last 5 years).""

Morgan Stanley is less confident that Apple will launch its [rumored iPhone subscription](https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/02/12/apples-iphone-hardware-subscription-could-arrive-by-march) service, but argues that if it does, the impact on its stock price will be enormous.

""A Hardware subscription launch would help unlock over $1T of market cap and re-rate shares toward our $230 bull case valuation,"" says the firm.

""What gets us most excited as an Apple analyst today is the business model transformation Apple is undergoing,"" it continues, ""shifting toward a model focused on installed base monetization rather than unit growth, which in our view, increasingly argues for a valuation more commensurate of a subscription-like business \[instead of a technology platform.\]""

That $230 price target is greater than even Morgan Stanley's [previous high](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/01/28/morgan-stanley-bumps-apple-price-target-to-210-on-record-breaking-q1-2022) of $210, which came on the back of a record-breaking 2021.",10,2,foreignfilmfiend,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/11i7zi0/morgan_stanley_raises_apple_target_price_to_180/,11i7zi0

2022-07-29 16:13:31,r/AAPL,Apple’s Record Revenue,"Shares of Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) jumped 2.97% in after-hours trading on Thursday after the technology giant posted positive financial earnings.

Financials: Apple reported earnings of $1.20 per share and revenue of $83 billion; both were better than expected.

The Good: The company’s iPhone revenue totaled $40.67 billion, which was better than expected. Overall, the company posted a June quarter record revenue.

The Bad: Services revenue was $19.6 billion, which was below estimates. And revenue for Mac decreased by $1 billion year-over-year.

Let’s Cook: In an interview, Apple CEO Tim Cook said there were some challenges, including supply constraints and shutdowns in China, but Cook anticipates revenue accelerating and sees no “macroeconomic effect” on iPhone sales.

Final Thoughts: Apple is down 13% this year, which is better than most tech stocks. Despite problems, the company found a way to have a good quarter.

NQ-100: https://www.tradingview.com/x/PaXafiQq/

The market complexion has changed greatly from ""there is no chance of a recession"" to ""well, maybe there could be a recession"" as the economic data continues to deteriorate. Continuing Jobless Claims in the United States increased to 1.375M in the week ending June 25 of 2022 from 1.324M in the previous week. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose by 4K to 235K in the week that ended July 2nd, compared to market expectations of 230K, suggesting labor market conditions could be moderating.

But, I think it is just getting started as many companies are laying off and cancelling employment offers. These activities take time to get into the system and ""The Counting Rule"" is... they must be actively looking in-order to be counted. So, don't hold your breadth. And keep in mind the Fed will remain hiking rates, while the ECB will eventually need to jump on this wagon.

Speaking of the ECB.

The United States is acting as-if The Federal Reserve Raising Interest Rates solves everything. Government Debt in the [United ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/TSX-UNC/)States increased to 30,499,619 Trillion in May from 30,374,155 Trillion in April of 2022.

The US Debt to GDP increased to 137% from 128%. They act as-if there is nothing for the public to worry about; however, many issues have not begun to trickle into the US, as far as we're concerned.🥶Winter is going to be a huge test for the US and so will the household debt crisis -- not yet discussed in media as companies are trying to figure out how to keep consumers spending (e.g. buy now; pay later).

But, raising rates does not stop the government from spending, nor does it stop the government from issuing more debt. We also have other factors in play such as the Federal Reserve Balance Sheet , [M2](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/m2/) Money Supply, and WH Executive Orders at play here.

HOWEVER.... The point of this post is the ""very tight"" interconnection between the US and UK. Remember it is a global market and just like the global market crash of 1929 we are more connected today than ever before.

👉 The US and UK are at EXTREME levels of government debt and both facing economic collapse scenarios.😳 If the UK goes down - don't think for a minute that the US cannot go along with it. You have seen my recent post about the US Liquidity Swaps, right? If not, scroll down the news feed and you'll see it.

Nevertheless, through my external analysis of the markets (with annotated charts) there remains a very-strong conviction that the recent lows of the financial markets will be tested and broken. This also takes into account the Federal Reserve [Balance Sheet](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/fundamental/) and the fact the Government Debt continues to expand against the GDP.

Downside targets for the SPX and NDXNDX = T1 9,538; T2 8,200 (current price is at 12,109.05) SPX T1 3,040; T2 = 2,750 (current price is at 3,902)

I GET IT... Many will not be supportive of the above. I am not here to say, ""see, I told you so"" or anything of that nature - as I'm providing my thesis into all the posts I provide with thorough assessments into the global markets and not based on raw emotions.

I really hope this post (and others) have been informative, helpful, or at least worthy enough for your review. I ""value your time"" and am humbled that you took the time to read, comment, etc. on any of my posts.

2022-05-11 16:16:13,r/AAPL,China lockdown areas showing no new covid cases,"Now, hopefully, China will remove the restrictions.  This is the problem Tim Cook was talking about costing Apple 4-8 billion this quarter.  During the lockdowns Apple plants have been mostly functional inside hermetically sealed factory campuses with dorms, with government assistance, but workers have started losing their minds.   Plus no one in China can go Apple stores until the lockdowns end. 

We have a real massive correction going on now, even without Putin, but almost all the stuffing has been knocked out of the market.  Some weaker former meme stocks may go out of business, but this major stress test is evolutionary.  The weak are weeded out and the strong shall survive and become stronger, and when though AAPL has suffered a 15% drop, that is somewhat merciful and can be easily recouped fast once the stormclouds clear. Looking to the 4th quarter of this year to get back on track. 

Bloomberg experts are now saying that the sentiment about where the bottom will turn out to be has us close to it now, but not quite there.  They said a 20% correction would likely signal a bottom and we are 3-4% away from that now. But of course not alls tocks or sectors are in the same boats here,.

I am no technical expert but 155 now 152 has been holding and if 150 is breached the 145 level should hold.  The huge Apple buybacks also provide foundational support and rocket fuel into rallies.  I know picking bottoms is just luck, but if you pick the right stocks at a peak negative time, you will likely do great in the medium term.

I made an 80% profit on AAPL in six months 2008 buying at the pits of the crash. That is an example. I know many dont have any cash to invest are afraid to go on margin, but there is a tremendous amount of cash on the sidelines now and US blue chip stocks are the safest places to invest, so given all that, Putin permitting (a huge caveat) this is a great time to buy the very best stocks at large discounts",13,0,Immediate-Assist-598,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/comments/unauxm/china_lockdown_areas_showing_no_new_covid_cases/,unauxm
